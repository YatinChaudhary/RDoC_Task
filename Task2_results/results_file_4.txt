Acute_Threat_Fear
27576271	Temporal phases of threat response, including potential threat (anxiety), acute threat (startle, fear), and post-threat response modulation, have been identified as the underlying markers of anxiety disorders.
28599071	Acute predator threat has emerged as an ethological model of PTSD, yet the effects of predator odor on signaling cascades associated with long-term memory remain poorly understood.
27981438	Most crucially, rather than anxious individuals having greater difficulty rejecting external threatening information, we observed that external threat may in its own right generally impair filtering efficiency in anxious individuals.
16111764	In light of the increasing threat of large-scale massacres such as terrorism against non-combatants (civilians), more attention is warranted not only to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but also to acute sociogenic pseudoneurological ("conversion") symptoms, especially epidemic sociogenic symptoms.
17445017	The fear that results from working in a climate of potential danger can also have a damaging impact on patient care.
26613707	Perceived threat and fear at the time of the cardiac event predicted affective response at both time points, partly mediated by threat reappraisal.

26991018	The amygdala has been shown to be essential for the processing of acute and learned fear across animal species.
19782055	Although KOR signaling during acute stress may increase physical ability (by producing analgesia) and motivation to escape a threat (by producing aversion), prolonged KOR signaling in response to chronic or uncontrollable stress can lead to persistent expression of behavioral signs that are characteristic of human depressive disorders (i.e., "prodepressive-like" signs).
26877119	Panic attacks are considered as abrupt and intense fear responses to acute threat arising from inside the body, while anxious apprehension refers to anxiety responses to potential harm and more distant or uncertain threat.
22390711	These experiments show that acute contextual threat and learning experiences interact to shape the deployment of attention away from danger cues.
21122818	It has been proposed that the anxiolytic effects of alcohol are mediated via the amygdala, an area critical to fear perception and responding.
17259206	Participants then completed a series of tasks assessing emotional aspects of attention (visual-probe task), perception (categorization of facial affect), memory (emotional memory task) and reactivity to threat (emotion potentiated startle).
16298490	The present results provide support for the fear-avoidance model of pain [Vlaeyen JWS, Linton SJ Fear-avoidance and its consequences in chronic musculoskeletal pain: a state of the art Pain 2000;85:317-332] and confirm the importance of threat-expectancy in hypervigilance towards pain and fear avoidance.

21277566	Indirect evidence in rodents suggests that acute cortisone could selectively increase some forms of long-duration aversive states, such as "anxiety," but not relatively similar, briefer aversive states, such as "fear."
26877132	Focusing on one key RDoC construct, acute threat or "fear," the current article illustrates a construct-oriented psychoneurometric strategy for operationalizing this construct in individual difference terms-as threat sensitivity (THT+).
Arousal
28986700	Previous studies have shown that music is a powerful means to convey affective states, but it remains unclear whether and how social context shape the intensity and quality of emotions perceived in music.
22562463	More specifically, introspective (i.e., verbal reports) and objective (heart rate and respiration rate) measures of arousal were incorporated to examine the relationships between arousal states and both, process components (i.e., routine consistency, timing), and outcome scores related to golf performance.
26751631	The more nations valued excitement and other high arousal positive states, the more their leaders showed excited smiles; similarly, the more nations valued calm and other low-arousal positive states, the more their leaders showed calm smiles.

20424047	These experiments support the conceptual model linking high-motivation affective states to narrowed attention and low-motivation affective states to broadened attention.
30448351	This result may be due to different neurophysiological mechanisms underlying afferent signals from the bladder compared to other visceral organs or interference with affective states or sympathetic activation associated with bladder filling.
23896304	Anxious Arousal symptoms (e.g., shakiness, heart racing) predicted larger abstinence-induced increases in fatigue and depressive affect (betas .15-.24).
25701720	At each alert, a short questionnaire was filled in, asking questions about passage of present time, affective state, arousal level, and attention to current activities, among others.
26214569	In Study 1, the more people reported a limited time perspective, the more they wanted to feel calm and experience other low-arousal positive states.

28463060	In each experiment, participants rated their affective states after unimodal and multimodal presentations.
29321533	This study tests whether the ability to process facial expressions (faces having a neutral expression, expressing fear, or disgust) can be influenced by making the participants' body state congruent with the expressed emotion (e.g., high heart rate in the case of faces expressing fear).
23646134	Here we tested 1) whether acoustic startle reflex (ASR), skin conductance response (SCR) and heart rate (HR) elicited by highly arousing stimuli specifically reflect a defensive state and 2) the relation between resting heart rate variability (HRV) and affective responding.
18346833	MV emerges as the most reliable respiratory index of self-perceived arousal.
22148994	These data support the contention that the serotonin system influences affective responses to social stimuli.
26876723	Three new antidepressive therapeutics arising from this work are briefly noted: 1) DBS of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) in humans, 2) reduction of psychological pain that may arise from excessive PANIC arousal, and 3) facilitation of social joy through the study of social play in rats The overall argument is that we may more readily develop new psychiatric interventions through preclinical models if we take animal emotional feelings seriously, as opposed to just behavioral changes, as targets for development of new treatments.
30684514	Although the family of positive affective states is diverse, no study examined whether high-approach positive affect (e.g., desire) has a different impact on peripheral physiological processes than more frequently studied low-approach positive affect (e.g., amusement).
29939058	Exploratory results of Study 1 indicated that valuation of high arousal positive affective states was significantly associated with lower depression symptoms but higher anxiety and alcohol abuse symptoms and that valuation of high arousal negative states was specifically associated with greater anxiety symptoms.
26884121	Due to their direct inaccessibility, affective states are classically assessed by gathering concomitant physiological and behavioral measures.
30718450	We assessed 10 OCD patients with on and off STN DBS in a double-blind randomized manner by recording ratings of valence and arousal to low- and high-intensity positive and negative emotional images.

26595354	Conversely, there was a bidirectional relationship between TV violence and physical aggression over time.
25059795	The curvilinear associations between social competence bias and two forms of aggression (physical and relational) were examined in a sample of 4th through 6th graders (n = 183); moderation by both sex and peer status (peer preference and popularity) also were tested.
28782091	Specifically, the effects of cumulative risk on physical aggression were particularly evident in children characterized by low baseline PNS activity and/or by nonreciprocal activity of the PNS and SNS, characterized by decreased activity (i.e., coinhibition) or increased activity (i.e., coactivation) of both systems at baseline and/or in response to emotional challenge.
25047296	Older (M = 16.46, SD = 1.35 years) and younger (M = 13.67, SD = 1.56 years) siblings from 101 dyads rated the psychological control they received from mothers and siblings, and the relational aggression they received from siblings.

25140524	High ruminators were expected to show initial vigilance followed by subsequent disengagement for loss stimuli (i.e., picture deceased with a loss word) in the first 1500 ms. Additionally, we expected high ruminators to avoid these loss stimuli and to show attentional preference for non-loss-related negative stimuli (i.e., picture stranger with a negative word) on longer exposure durations (1500-10000 ms).
8135720	Correlations with the Padua Inventory subscales showed that obsessional loss of mental control was moderately correlated to both worry and checking, whereas worry and checking were only weakly correlated.
26307047	Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) showed losing a relation (AOR = 5.7, 95% CI, 1.2-28.0) was a predictor of "feeling unhappy or depressed", loss of a relation (AOR = 10.1, 95% CI, 1.7-60.7) was a predictor of inability to concentrate.
29654021	A total of 42.9% (1113/2593) said they would worry if they had any vision loss and 79.6% (2063/2593) knew that DM could cause blindness.
25239281	Areas of concern that were discussed that were specific to the caregiver and not fully evaluated by existing patient-reported outcomes (PROs) included feelings of loss, anxiety related to the caregiver role (reinjury concerns, worry about leaving the person alone, etc), and caregiver strain (burden, stress, feeling overwhelmed, etc).

25547338	Most common reasons for missed meals included loss of appetite and feelings of fatigue or worry.
22571425	If rationality is the only factor in valuing a human life, then the loss of that rationality (however such loss might be defined) would allow us to use essentially utilitarian thinking in order to support non-voluntary euthanasia, since the patients themselves would no longer be moral agents that demand respect.
28843136	Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), the best available treatment for BED, does not consistently produce weight loss or improvements in weight QOL.
Potential_Threat_Anxiety
25793401	Moreover, the positive relationship between the salience of the Iranian threat and symptoms of anxiety was stronger among OHS.
20497902	Here, we applied psychophysiological and neuroimaging methodologies sensitive to sustained arousal-based responses to test the role of the human BNST in mediating environmental threat monitoring, a potential experimental model for sustained anxiety symptoms.
22277369	This study investigated modifications to standing posture in response to elevated postural anxiety evoked by a potential physical threat to stability.
22913339	The challenge group performed more accurately, reported more favorable emotions, and displayed more effective gaze, putting kinematics, and muscle activity than the threat group.
27369069	These findings identify potential mechanisms by which threat of unpredictable shock can facilitate distinct cognitive functions.
28008077	Afterwards, in an identical test phase participants watched the same visual cues from the previous phase indicating potential threat or safety, and received painful thermal stimulation.
26480349	Better accuracy was observed for altered images encoded during periods of threat compared to safety, but only if those images were also retrieved during periods of safety.
25538644	Together, these results indicate a serious need to develop new tasks and methods to more reliably investigate attentional bias to threat and its relationship to anxiety in both clinical and non-clinical populations.
27129757	Considerable translational research on anxiety examines attention bias to threat and the efficacy of attention training in reducing symptoms.
23959788	CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the potential of threat-related attention bias as a behavioral marker of PTSD and anxiety symptoms in a high-risk military occupational context.
20136732	The main finding is that pleasant pictures elicited a sustained negative difference potential over occipital regions during threat as compared to safety periods.
26042381	RESULTS: Results provide some evidence that socially anxious individuals preferentially allocate their attention towards threat faces compared to non-anxious controls.
24562723	There is some evidence that this long-standing pattern of vigilance toward threat in key developmental periods may in part explain the increased risk of the development of anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder following exposure to violence.
17530492	The magnitude of group differences for explicit recall of threat words was similar to those previously observed in panic disorder.
25084754	However, whether and how anxiety is related to attentional capture at a more basic level (i.e., in the absence of threat) is less well understood.
28024913	The present study sought to address this gap by examining anxiety sensitivity, a transdiagnostic factor related to both anxiety and smoking, as a potential mediator for the influence of anxiety symptoms on smoking-related processes, including threat-related smoking abstinence expectancies (somatic symptoms and harmful consequences), perceived barriers for cessation, and problems experienced during past quit attempts.
27693664	Under these specific circumstances, ABM reduces anxiety and acts through its target mechanism, supporting ABM's theoretical basis while simultaneously suggesting clinical indications and refinements to improve its currently limited clinical potential.
20708493	Patterns of synchrony in repeated measures of heart rate, skin conductance levels, negative affect, and positive affect were investigated in patients with social anxiety disorder and non-anxious controls during a speech task.
27766643	However, little is known about the reverse influence of breathlessness on emotional processes, as well as its modulation by anxiety sensitivity (AS).
26459845	In addition, high and low worriers differed in processing of threat and neutral images as indexed by the late positive potential.
19055504	Threat-related attentional disruptions in anxiety may relate to changes in cognitive control during task processing.
28407726	ABMT may target specific threat processes associated with dysfunctional amygdala-insula connectivity that are not targeted by CBT alone.
26039081	However, for the control group, the overall level of threat perceived in facial stimuli was correlated with two important indices of mental health (depression and anxiety).
23709354	Given its social origin, we asked whether an anxiety-inducing social situation could enhance the processing of faces linked to the situational threat.
28606471	There is some evidence to suggest that problematic alcohol use is also associated with an enhanced ERN; although prior studies have been almost exclusively in men and have yet to examine the potential interactive effects of anxiety and alcohol abuse symptoms.
20196100	In particular, the late positive potential (LPP) reflects increased attention to emotional stimuli-and was recently found to be larger with increasing state anxiety.
27110477	Individuals with high levels of worry (and particularly those with generalized anxiety disorder) find it very difficult to control worry once it has started.
12881033	Potential avenues for future studies on anxiety-related threat-perception distortions are briefly discussed.
26090588	However, complex adaptive systems, such as our adaptation to threat or stress, by definition provide many and often interrelated points of breakdown or dysregulation, which, if sustained, may lead to psychopathology.
28370078	The startle reflex and self-reported anxiety were increased in anticipation of both types of threat relative to no threat.
23834735	The purpose of the present investigation was to examine emotional reactions to a health threat.
28364943	In successive epochs of this game, participants collect monetary tokens on a spatial grid while under threat of virtual predation.
21147162	We emphasize the potential value of a model of threat detection and precautionary responses that integrates cognitive-affective neuroscience and evolutionary approaches for understanding the anxiety disorders.
28183031	These results add to the literature finding associations between systemic levels of inflammation and brain function and suggest that threat-related amygdala activity may serve as a potential pathway through which heightened chronic inflammation may increase risk for mood and anxiety problems.
Sleep_Wakefulness
15212970	On the other hand, no significant difference was observed in the total times of wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement sleep and rapid eye movement sleep by any drugs used in the experiments.
24437258	On the other hand, circadian rhythms in sleep-wakefulness are expressed by two independent but mutually coupled oscillators, the circadian pacemaker and the oscillator specific to sleep-wakefulness.
9729321	Moreover, we observed that LR animals slept more than the HR animals, whereas the two groups had similar levels of paradoxical sleep.
21647372	Hypothalamic neurons expressing neuropeptide orexins are critically involved in the control of sleep and wakefulness.
9098558	It was observed that carbachol induced wakefulness accompanied by a fall in body temperature while scopolamine induced an opposite effect, i.e., sleep accompanied by an increase in body temperature.
28232786	Temporal patterns of sleep-wakefulness and feeding also changed accordingly.
17245312	Cells bodies of hypocretin neurons are restricted mainly to the lateral and ventral hypothalamus, while hypocretin fibers project throughout the brain, including several areas implicated in the regulation of the sleep/wakefulness cycle.
22401482	The disorder consists of a constant or recurrent pattern of sleep interruption that results in insomnia when sleep is needed and excessive sleepiness during waking hours.
9503822	Therefore, the mechanism of sleep-wakefulness change of the forebrain primarily does not depend on the lower brain stem structures such as the raphe nuclei and midbrain reticular formation.
16077148	During entrainment to external 24-h cycles, the opposing interplay between circadian and homeostatic changes in sleep propensity consolidates sleep and wakefulness.
20128854	Non-REM sleep and wakefulness were unaffected by Endo.
27286696	The sleep-wakefulness cycle was studied by continuous EEG and motor activity monitoring 1 and 2 weeks after MPTP injection.
9812847	It was also observed that in free moving rats the time of wakefulness was respectively decreased and increased by the two drugs.
23401916	So, dopamine and its agonist apomorphine increase in sleep-wakefulness cycle duration of sleep-like state ofcataplexy (homolog of the sleep) in frogs, in 30-day-old rats it increase the share of wakefulness and catalepsy.
24701564	The changes in sleep-wakefulness were compared statistically.
11095491	Compared to saline vehicle control, orexin-A induced an increase in wakefulness for 70 min and suppressed all sleep stages, especially SWS2 and REM for 80 and 90 min, respectively.
12068146	NE level was the highest in active waking (AW) and, when compared to AW, NE level was progressively lower in quiet waking (QW; 86%), quiet sleep (QS; 72%), and active sleep (AS or REM sleep; 61%).
12613391	The results of the study show that this area may serve as a fine tuning mechanism which helps to interlink the sleep-wakefulness with the thermoregulation.
12150786	Levels of histamine during rapid eye movement sleep were lowest (0.245+/-0.032 pg/microl), being significantly lower than levels during non-rapid eye movement sleep (0.395+/-0.081 pg/microl) and being only 21% of wakefulness levels.
23620827	A neurotensin receptor antagonist decreased Fos expression in orexin neurons and wakefulness time in wild type mice when administered intraperitoneally.
12764116	The increase in extracellular levels of adenosine during prolonged wakefulness is thought to facilitate the transition to sleep by reducing the discharge activity of wakefulness-promoting neurons in the basal forebrain.
9503824	Accumulated evidences suggest the relevance of these amines to the regulatory system of sleep-wakefulness cycle.
20969999	Normal cycling between discrete behavioral states is mediated by the combined influence of a sleep need that increases with continued wakefulness and an intrinsic circadian oscillation.
24406723	We found comparable sleep behavior during the adaptation nights between both conditions.
18275560	Sleep/wakefulness (S/W) disorders are frequent in Parkinson's disease (PD).

10869848	There was a mild reduction in sleep and increase in wakefulness after the lesion.
Sustained_Threat
21242990	Our results demonstrate that combat stress has sustained consequences on neural responsivity, and suggest a key role for the appraisal of threat on an amygdala-centered neural network in the aftermath of severe stress.
22250290	Furthermore, ventromedial prefrontal recruitment was lower in individuals with higher scores on intolerance of uncertainty measures, and this hyporecruitment predicted greater transient amygdala responding to potential threat cues.
28981839	We defined phasic and a systematic variation of sustained response models for blood oxygen level-dependent responses during threat anticipation, to disentangle temporally dissociable involvement of the BNST and the amygdala.
28555565	Hyperactivation of this region during elevated state anxiety may account for the paradoxical facilitation of performance on tasks that require an external focus of attention, and impairment of performance on tasks that require an internal focus of attention.
24886788	Here, we used a robust translational paradigm (threat of shock) to induce sustained anxiety.
21075229	CONCLUSIONS: These results provide first evidence for a prefrontal mechanism that functions to control anxiety after threat offset, which may be dysfunctional in patients who suffer from excessive sustained anxiety.
22390706	SAD patients showed a sustained threat bias, though it was smaller than in healthy controls.
15837118	The sustained BDNF up-regulation in the hippocampi of mice subjected to repeated social threat could be related to rewarding aspects of aggressive interactions, suggested by our previous studies.
30878610	The present results point towards potentially SAD-specific threat processing marked by elevated phasic but not sustained CeA and BNST responses when compared to HC.
25761115	Major findings are that (1) a motion sensitive platform built on mechano-electrical transducers enables measurement of startle responses in freely behaving mice, (2) absence or presence of startle stimuli during retrieval as well as unpredictability of a given threat determine phasic and sustained fear response profiles and (3) both freezing and startle responses indicate phasic and sustained components of behavioral fear, with sustained freezing reflecting unpredictability of conditioned stimulus (CS)/unconditioned stimulus (US) pairings.
27698427	Using fear training with predictable or unpredictable cues in mice, combined with local and cell-type-specific deficiency and rescue of cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors, we found that presynaptic CB1 receptors on distinct amygdala projections to bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) are both necessary and sufficient for the shift from phasic to sustained fear in response to an unpredictable threat.
30463809	Therefore, this study aims to examine the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) on the subjects' psychophysiological responses as measured by skin conductance reaction (SCR) during a sustained threat paradigm.
20727909	In contrast to a perceptible threat that releases freezing, fleeing and fighting, abstract potential threat elicits anxiety and vigilance.
17582673	Enhanced N200 following fearful faces was linked to sustained and even slightly improved executive attention performance (reduced conflict interference) among high threat-sensitive individuals, but with decrements in executive attention among low threat-sensitive individuals.
17683209	A parallel line of research has determined that threatening stimuli more readily capture attention.
17554005	Presentation of the cue in either threat condition was associated with increased CBF in the left amygdala.
24095880	In our regions of interest, we observed phasic, rather than sustained, activation during sustained threat in dorsolateral and inferior frontal regions, anterior and dorsal cingulate, ventral striatum and regions associated with emotion, including the amygdala, insula, substantia nigra and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis complex.
19693004	The amygdala and BNST send outputs to the same hypothalamic and brainstem targets to produce phasic and sustained fear, respectively.
27369069	This effect consisted of improved performance on the Sustained Attention to Response Task (a Go-NoGo task consisting of 91% Go and 9% NoGo trials) in threat (unpredictable electrical shock) vs safe (no shock) conditions.
26810702	Participants overestimated the effective frequency of aversive pictures following the uncertain cue, both during and after the task, signifying expectancy and covariation biases, and they tended to express lower subjective valences for aversive pictures presented after the uncertain cue.
18472088	However, under conditions of sustained environmental threat this otherwise-present attention bias disappears.
25062842	The present study leveraged event-related potentials (ERPs) in conjunction with behavioral measures in the dot-probe task to examine whether more direct measures of attention might reveal an attentional bias to threat in unselected individuals.
22913418	Threat cues elicit defensive reactions mediated by limbic brain circuitry that is also implicated in risk-sensitive decision making.
29980493	In response to fearful faces, the drug prevented habituation, caused sustained amygdala activation, and led to increased activation in other brain areas associated with threat processing, such as the insula and putamen.
30144498	When avoidance was unavailable, as during the extinction phase, we observed sustained differential skin conductance responses for threat versus safety cues.
28013055	Eye-tracking was used to assess multiple forms of threat bias (i.e., early vigilance, sustained attention, facilitated engagement, delayed disengagement) thought to be related to anxiety.
25143607	The amygdala became more central to network function (as assessed via betweenness centrality) during threat across all participants, and the extent to which the BNST became more central during threat depended on self-reported anxiety.
15294391	The P300 amplitudes of the ERP evoked by the visual cues did not differ under threat and counting, which suggested that both conditions engaged attention to the same extent.
21440905	Participants showed fear-potentiated startle to the threat cue in the P condition.
20883506	The present study used the face-in-the-crowd task and event-related potentials to find evidence for the functionality of attention shifts in threat detection.
21111828	We found that both predictable and unpredictable threat evoked transient activity in the dorsal amygdala, but that only unpredictable threat produced sustained activity in a forebrain region corresponding to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis complex.
28485259	We aimed to reveal phasic and sustained brain responses and functional connectivity of the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) during threat anticipation in PD.
21666261	Together, these studies provide evidence consistent with an early, reflexive amygdala response tuned to clear threat and a later reflective response tuned to ambiguous threat.
26829532	The controversies and global threat of these viruses require rapid response policy and evidence-based implementation findings.
30993690	During the past decade several notable viruses have suddenly emerged from obscurity or anonymity to become serious global health threats, provoking concern regarding their sustained epidemic transmission in immunologically naive human populations.
26601909	The current study examines the impact of emotions on actions using a novel behavioral paradigm and functional neuroimaging to assess cognitive control under sustained states of threat (anticipation of an aversive noise) and excitement (anticipation of winning money).
