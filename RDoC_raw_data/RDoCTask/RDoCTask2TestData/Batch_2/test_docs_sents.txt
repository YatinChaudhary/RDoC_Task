Previous studies have shown that music is a powerful means to convey affective states, but it remains unclear whether and how social context shape the intensity and quality of emotions perceived in music.
Using a within-subject design, we studied this question in two experimental settings, i.e., when subjects were alone versus in company of others without direct social interaction or feedback.
Non-vocal musical excerpts of the emotional qualities happiness or sadness were rated on arousal and valence dimensions.
We found evidence for an amplification of perceived emotion in the solitary listening condition, i.e., happy music was rated as happier and more arousing when nobody else was around and, in an analogous manner, sad music was perceived as sadder.
This difference might be explained by a shift of attention in the presence of others.
The observed interaction of perceived emotion and social context did not differ for stimuli of different cultural origin.

Individual affect-related performance zones (IAPZs) method utilizing Kamata et al (J Sport Exerc Psychol 24:189-208, 2002) probabilistic model of determining the individual zone of optimal functioning was utilized as idiosyncratic affective patterns during golf performance.
To do so, three male golfers of a varsity golf team were observed during three rounds of golf competition.
The investigation implemented a multi-modal assessment approach in which the probabilistic relationship between affective states and both, performance process and performance outcome, measures were determined.
More specifically, introspective (i.e., verbal reports) and objective (heart rate and respiration rate) measures of arousal were incorporated to examine the relationships between arousal states and both, process components (i.e., routine consistency, timing), and outcome scores related to golf performance.
Results revealed distinguishable and idiosyncratic IAPZs associated with physiological and introspective measures for each golfer.
The associations between the IAPZs and decision-making or swing/stroke execution were strong and unique for each golfer.
Results are elaborated using cognitive and affect-related concepts, and applications for practitioners are provided.

Cultures differ in the emotions they teach their members to value ("ideal affect").
We conducted 3 studies to examine whether leaders' smiles reflect these cultural differences in ideal affect.
In Study 1, we compared the smiles of top-ranked American and Chinese government leaders, chief executive officers, and university presidents in their official photos.
Consistent with findings that Americans value excitement and other high-arousal positive states more than Chinese, American top-ranked leaders (N = 98) showed more excited smiles than Chinese top-ranked leaders (N = 91) across occupations.
In Study 2, we compared the smiles of winning versus losing political candidates and higher versus lower ranking chief executive officers and university presidents in the United States and Taiwan/China.
American leaders (N = 223) showed more excited smiles than Taiwanese/Chinese leaders (N = 266), regardless of election outcome or ranking.
In Study 3, we administered self-report measures of ideal affect in college student samples from 10 different nations (N = 1,267) and then 8 years later, coded the smiles that legislators from those nations showed in their official photos (N = 3,372).
The more nations valued excitement and other high arousal positive states, the more their leaders showed excited smiles; similarly, the more nations valued calm and other low-arousal positive states, the more their leaders showed calm smiles.
These results held after controlling for national differences in democratization, human development, and gross domestic product per capita.
Together, these findings suggest that leaders' smiles reflect the affective states valued by their cultures.

BACKGROUND: Embodied models of social cognition argue that others' affective states are processed by re-enacting a sensory-specific representation of the same state in the observer.
However, neuroimaging studies suggest that a reliable part of the representation shared between self and others is supramodal and relates to dimensions such as Unpleasantness or arousal, common to qualitatively different experiences.
Here we investigated whether representations of first-hand pain and disgust influenced the subsequent evaluation of facial expressions in Modality-specific fashion, or in terms of Unpleasantness or arousal.
METHODS: Thirty volunteers were subjected to thermal painful and olfactory disgusting events, and subsequently were asked to classify computer-generated faces expressing pain (characterized by high Unpleasantness and arousal), disgust (high Unpleasantness and low arousal), surprise (low Unpleasantness and high arousal) and hybrid combinations thereof.
RESULTS: Thermal and olfactory events were associated with comparable Unpleasantness ratings and heart rate (but stronger galvanic response was found for painful temperatures).
Furthermore, we found that the appraisal of facial expressions was biased by the prior stimulus, with more frequent pain classifications following thermal stimuli, and more frequent disgust classifications following olfactory stimuli.
Critically, this modulation was cross-modal in nature, as each first-hand stimulation influenced in comparable fashion facial traits diagnostic of both pain and disgust, without instead generalizing to features of surprise.
CONCLUSION: Overall, these data support the presence of shared coding between one's aversive experiences and the appraisal of others' facial responses, which is best describable as supramodal representation of the Unpleasantness of the experience.
SIGNIFICANCE: These results extend previous findings about common representational coding between the experience of first-hand and others' pain.
In particular, they highlight that reliable part of the information shared is supramodal in nature and relates to a broad dimension of Unpleasantness common also to painless aversive states such as disgust.

Positive and negative affects high in motivational intensity cause a narrowing of attentional focus.
In contrast, positive affects low in motivational intensity cause a broadening of attentional focus.
The attentional consequences of negative affects low in motivational intensity have not been experimentally investigated.
Experiment 1 compared the attentional consequences of negative affect low in motivational intensity (sadness) relative to a neutral affective state.
Results indicated that low-motivation negative affect caused attentional broadening.
Experiment 2 found that disgust, a high-motivation negative affect not previously investigated in attentional studies, narrowed attentional focus.
These experiments support the conceptual model linking high-motivation affective states to narrowed attention and low-motivation affective states to broadened attention.

The aim of the current study was to investigate if startle methodology is suitable to reflect urinary urgency.
Eighteen healthy men were tested on two separate days, each including an ingestion of fluid until 80% of the subjective urge to micturate was reached.
EMG responses to acoustic startle stimuli were assessed before and after micturition, as well as in the early and late cardiac cycle phases (230 vs. 530ms after a cardiac R-wave).
Sonographic assessment confirmed bladder-filling status.
Emotional arousal, stress, urge and unpleasantness ratings, as well as mean blood pressure were higher before than after micturition.
Startle eye blink responses were lower during the early than during the late cardiac cycle phase, but were not affected by bladder filling status.
We conclude that startle methodology is suitable for the investigation of afferent signals from the cardiovascular system, but not to reflect urinary urgency.
This result may be due to different neurophysiological mechanisms underlying afferent signals from the bladder compared to other visceral organs or interference with affective states or sympathetic activation associated with bladder filling.
Notwithstanding, the present research protocol of fluid intake, sonographic assessment of the bladder, and subjective reports, can be applied to examine effects of urinary urge on physiological and psychological processes.

BACKGROUND: The complex concordance and discordance across and within anxiety and depressive symptoms complicates understanding of the relation between emotional symptoms and manifestations of tobacco withdrawal.
The goal of this study was to parse the broad variation in anxiety and depressive symptoms into conceptually discrete components and explore their relative predictive influence on affective patterns of acute tobacco withdrawal.
METHODS: We employed a within-participant experimentally manipulated tobacco abstinence design involving: (i) a baseline visit at which past-week depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed and (ii) two counterbalanced experimental visits-one after ad lib smoking and one after 16-h of tobacco abstinence-at which state affect was assessed.
Participants were community-dwelling adults (N=187) smoking 10+ cig/day for at least two years without an active mood disorder.
RESULTS: Anxiety-related general distress symptoms (e.g., tension, nervousness) predicted greater abstinence-induced increases in various negative affective states but not changes in positive affect (betas .17-.33).
Depression-related general distress symptoms (e.g., sadness, worthlessness) predicted greater abstinence-induced increases in acute depressed affect only (betas .24-.25).
Anhedonic symptoms (e.g., diminished interest, lack of pleasure) predicted larger abstinence-induced decreases in acute positive affect only (betas .17-.20).
Anxious Arousal symptoms (e.g., shakiness, heart racing) predicted larger abstinence-induced increases in fatigue and depressive affect (betas .15-.24).
CONCLUSION: Different components of anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with unique affective patterns of acute tobacco withdrawal.
These results provide insight into the affective mechanisms underlying tobacco dependence and could inform smoking cessation treatment approaches tailored to individuals with emotional distress.

Many people accept the idea that time seems to pass more quickly as they get older, as if this is a psychological reality.
However, systematic investigations of differences in judgments of passage of time between young and elderly people are very rare and contradictory.
The present study examined the experience of passage of time in daily life in young and elderly people using Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM), with 8 alerts per day for 5 days being delivered by smartphones.
At each alert, a short questionnaire was filled in, asking questions about passage of present time, affective state, arousal level, and attention to current activities, among others.
Our ESM study found no difference between the young and the old participants in the judgment of passage of present time.
Irrespective of the participants' age, the experience of passage of time in every-day life was significantly related to affective states and current activities when they captured attention.

Previous findings indirectly suggest that the more people perceive their time in life as limited, the more they value calm.
No study, however, has directly tested this hypothesis.
To this end, using a combination of survey, experience sampling, and experimental methods, we examined the relationship between future time perspective and the affective states that people ideally want to feel (i.e., their "ideal affect").
In Study 1, the more people reported a limited time perspective, the more they wanted to feel calm and experience other low-arousal positive states.
In Study 2, participants were randomly assigned to a limited time or an expanded time condition.
Participants in the limited time condition reported valuing calm and other low arousal positive states more than those in the expanded time condition.
We discuss the implications of these findings for broadening our understanding of the factors that shape how people ideally want to feel, and their consequences for decision making.

Neuroimaging findings are often interpreted in terms of affective experience, but researchers disagree about the advisability or even possibility of such inferences, and few frameworks explicitly link these levels of analysis.
Here, we suggest that the spatial and temporal resolution of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data could support inferences about affective states.
Specifically, we propose that fMRI nucleus accumbens (NAcc) activity is associated with positive arousal, whereas a combination of anterior insula activity and NAcc activity is associated with negative arousal.
This framework implies quantifiable and testable inferences about affect from fMRI data, which may ultimately inform predictions about approach and avoidance behavior.
We consider potential limits on neurally inferred affect before highlighting theoretical and practical benefits.

Few studies have investigated how attentional control is affected by transient affective states while taking individual differences in affective traits into consideration.
In this study, participants completed a color-word Stroop task immediately after undergoing a positive, neutral or negative affective context manipulation (ACM).
Behavioral performance was unaffected by any ACM considered in isolation.
For individuals high in trait negative affect (NA), performance was impaired by the negative but not the positive or neutral ACM.
Neuroimaging results indicate that activity in primarily top-down control regions of the brain (inferior frontal gyrus and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) was suppressed in the presence of emotional arousal (both negative and positive ACMs).
This effect appears to have been exacerbated or offset by co-occurring activity in other top-down control regions (parietal) and emotion processing regions (orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala and nucleus accumbens) as a function of the valence of state affect (positive or negative) and trait affect (trait NA or trait PA).
Neuroimaging results are consistent with behavioral findings.
In combination, they indicate both additive and interactive influences of trait and state affect on top-down control of attention.

The Affective Norms for Polish Short Texts (ANPST) dataset (Imbir, 2016d) is a list of 718 affective sentence stimuli with known affective properties with respect to subjectively perceived valence, arousal, dominance, origin, subjective significance, and source.
This article examines the reliability of the ANPST and the impact of population type and sex on affective ratings.
The ANPST dataset was introduced to provide a recognized method of eliciting affective states with linguistic stimuli more complex than single words and that included contextual information and thus are less ambiguous in interpretation than single word.
Analysis of the properties of the ANPST dataset showed that norms collected are reliable in terms of split-half estimation and that the distributions of ratings are similar to those obtained in other affective norms studies.
The pattern of correlations was the same as that found in analysis of an affective norms dataset for words based on the same six variables.
Female psychology students' valence ratings were also more polarized than those of their female student peers studying other subjects, but arousal ratings were only higher for negative words.
Differences also appeared for all other measured dimensions.
Women's valence ratings were found to be more polarized and arousal ratings were higher than those made by men, and differences were also present for dominance, origin, and subjective significance.
The ANPST is the first Polish language list of sentence stimuli and could easily be adapted for other languages and cultures.

Two experiments examined how affective values from visual and auditory modalities are integrated.
Experiment 1 paired music and videos drawn from three levels of valence while holding arousal constant.
Experiment 2 included a parallel combination of three levels of arousal while holding valence constant.
In each experiment, participants rated their affective states after unimodal and multimodal presentations.
Experiment 1 revealed a congruency effect in which stimulus combinations of the same extreme valence resulted in more extreme state ratings than component stimuli presented in isolation.
An interaction between music and video valence reflected the greater influence of negative affect.
Video valence was found to have a significantly greater effect on combined ratings than music valence.
The pattern of data was explained by a five parameter differential weight averaging model that attributed greater weight to the visual modality and increased weight with decreasing values of valence.
Experiment 2 revealed a congruency effect only for high arousal combinations and no interaction effects.
This pattern was explained by a three parameter constant weight averaging model with greater weight for the auditory modality and a very low arousal value for the initial state.
These results demonstrate key differences in audiovisual integration between valence and arousal.

Embodied theories of emotion assume that emotional processing is grounded in bodily and affective processes.
Accordingly, the perception of an emotion re-enacts congruent sensory and affective states; and conversely, bodily states congruent with a specific emotion facilitate emotional processing.
This study tests whether the ability to process facial expressions (faces having a neutral expression, expressing fear, or disgust) can be influenced by making the participants' body state congruent with the expressed emotion (e.g., high heart rate in the case of faces expressing fear).
We designed a task requiring participants to categorize pictures of male and female faces that either had a neutral expression (neutral), or expressed emotions whose linkage with high heart rate is strong (fear) or significantly weaker or absent (disgust).
Critically, participants were tested in two conditions: with experimentally induced high heart rate (Exercise) and with normal heart rate (Normal).
Participants processed fearful faces (but not disgusted or neutral faces) faster when they were in the Exercise condition than in the Normal condition.
These results support the idea that an emotionally congruent body state facilitates the automatic processing of emotionally-charged stimuli and this effect is emotion-specific rather than due to generic factors such as arousal.

Psychophysiological research on emotion utilizes various physiological response measures to index activation of the defense system.
Here we tested 1) whether acoustic startle reflex (ASR), skin conductance response (SCR) and heart rate (HR) elicited by highly arousing stimuli specifically reflect a defensive state and 2) the relation between resting heart rate variability (HRV) and affective responding.
In a within-subject design, participants viewed film clips with a positive, negative and neutral content.
In contrast to SCR and HR, we show that ASR differentiated between negative, neutral and positive states and can therefore be considered as a reliable index of activation of the defense system.
Furthermore, resting HRV was associated with affect-modulated characteristics of ASR, but not with SCR or HR.
Interestingly, individuals with low-HRV showed less differentiation in ASR between affective states.
We discuss the important value of ASR in psychophysiological research on emotion and speculate on HRV as a potential biological marker for demarcating adaptive from maladaptive responding.

The respiratory behavior during affective states is not completely understood.
We studied breathing pattern responses to picture series in 37 participants.
We also measured end-tidal pCO2 (EtCO2) to determine if ventilation is in balance with metabolic demands and spontaneous eye-blinking to investigate the link between respiration and attention.
Minute ventilation (MV) and inspiratory drive increased with self-rated arousal.
These relationships reflected increases in inspiratory volume rather than shortening of the time parameters.
EtCO2 covaried with pleasantness but not arousal.
Eye-blink rate decreased with increasing unpleasantness in line with a negativity bias in attention.
This study confirms that respiratory responses to affective stimuli are organized to a certain degree along the dimensions of valence and arousal.
It shows, for the first time, that during picture viewing, ventilatory increases with increasing arousal are in balance with metabolic activity and that inspiratory volume is modulated by arousal.
MV emerges as the most reliable respiratory index of self-perceived arousal.

Hypothesizing that genetic factors partially govern sensitivity to interpersonal cues, we examined whether a polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) in the serotonin transporter gene would moderate spouses' sensitivity to positive and negative partner affect.
Before and after marital discussions, participants from 76 couples (total n = 150) reported their affective states.
Spouses carrying the short allele of the 5-HTTLPR were more responsive to their partner's preinteraction positive affect and anxiety/nervousness, compared with spouses with two long alleles.
These data support the contention that the serotonin system influences affective responses to social stimuli.
In contrast to the view that the 5-HTTLPR primarily affects response to adverse experiences, these results suggest that this polymorphism moderates sensitivity to positive as well as negative affect.

The neural correlates of human emotions are easy to harvest.
In contrast, the neural constitution of emotional feelings in humans has resisted systematic scientific analysis.
This review summarizes how preclinical affective neuroscience initiatives are making progress in decoding the neural nature of such feelings in animal brains.
This has been achieved by studying the rewarding and punishing effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of subcortical emotional networks (labeled SEEING, RAGE, FEAR, LUST, CARE, PANIC, and PLAY systems) that evoke distinct emotion action patterns, as well as rewarding and punishing effects in animals.
The implications of this knowledge for development of new psychiatric interventions, especially depression, are discussed.
Three new antidepressive therapeutics arising from this work are briefly noted: 1) DBS of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) in humans, 2) reduction of psychological pain that may arise from excessive PANIC arousal, and 3) facilitation of social joy through the study of social play in rats The overall argument is that we may more readily develop new psychiatric interventions through preclinical models if we take animal emotional feelings seriously, as opposed to just behavioral changes, as targets for development of new treatments.

Positive affect has been related to faster cardiovascular recovery from stress.
Although the family of positive affective states is diverse, no study examined whether high-approach positive affect (e.g., desire) has a different impact on peripheral physiological processes than more frequently studied low-approach positive affect (e.g., amusement).
Building upon prior work on emotions and motivation, we expected that after controlling for arousal and valence, positive affect with higher motivational intensity would facilitate weaker recovery when compared to positive affect with lower motivational intensity.
Across two experiments (N=179 for Study 1, N=220 for Study 2), we measured cardiovascular, respiratory, and electrodermal responses to positive stimuli that differed in approach intensity.
We measured responses during recovery from stress and during reactivity to threat and anger.
These studies partially replicated previous findings regarding the soothing function of positive affect (e.g., in respect to diastolic blood pressure recovery and reactivity).
However, we found that high-approach and low-approach positive affect produced comparable effects.
In summary, these findings suggest that positive valence rather than motivational intensity produces the main soothing effect on peripheral physiology.

Prior research has indicated that ideal affect (i.e., the affective states that people value and would ideally like to experience) may be relevant to mental health outcomes.
Studies to date, however, have not used comprehensive multivariate models that account for covariation among facets of ideal affect and incorporate multiple clinical outcomes.
In the present studies, we used structural equation modeling to examine the multivariate effects of ideal affect on symptoms of depression, anxiety, and alcohol abuse in 2 moderately large samples of undergraduates (N = 293 and N = 146).
Exploratory results of Study 1 indicated that valuation of high arousal positive affective states was significantly associated with lower depression symptoms but higher anxiety and alcohol abuse symptoms and that valuation of high arousal negative states was specifically associated with greater anxiety symptoms.
These results were shown to be structurally invariant across samples and ethnicities in Study 2, which also found that ideal-actual affect discrepancies were significantly associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety.
These findings support and extend the hypothesis that ideal affect is implicated in clinical outcomes by highlighting the importance of jointly considering multiple facets of ideal and actual affect as they relate to a range of clinical syndromes.

Due to their direct inaccessibility, affective states are classically assessed by gathering concomitant physiological and behavioral measures.
Although such a dual approach to assess emotional states is frequently used in different species including humans, the invasiveness of procedures for physiological recordings particularly in smaller-sized animals strongly restricts their application.
We used infrared thermography, a non-invasive method, to assess physiological arousal during open field and elevated plus maze tests in mice.
By measuring changes in surface temperature indicative of the animals' emotional response, we aimed to improve the inherently limited and still controversial information provided by behavioral parameters commonly used in these tests.
Our results showed significant and consistent thermal responses during both tests, in accordance with classical physiological responses occurring in stressful situations.
Besides, we found correlations between these thermal responses and the occurrence of anxiety-related behaviors.
Furthermore, initial temperatures measured at the start of each procedure (open field, elevated plus maze), which can be interpreted as a measure of the animals' initial physiological arousal, predicted the levels of activity and of anxiety-related behaviors displayed during the tests.
Our results stress the strong link between physiological correlates of emotions and behaviors expressed during unconditioned fear tests.

Affective states underlie daily decision-making and pathological behaviours relevant to obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD), mood disorders and addictions.
Deep brain stimulation targeting the motor and associative-limbic subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been shown to be effective for Parkinson's disease (PD) and OCD, respectively.
Cognitive and electrophysiological studies in PD showed responses of the motor STN to emotional stimuli, impairments in recognition of negative affective states and modulation of the intensity of subjective emotion.
Here we studied whether the stimulation of the associative-limbic STN in OCD influences the subjective emotion to low-intensity positive and negative images and how this relates to clinical symptoms.
We assessed 10 OCD patients with on and off STN DBS in a double-blind randomized manner by recording ratings of valence and arousal to low- and high-intensity positive and negative emotional images.
STN stimulation increased positive ratings and decreased negative ratings to low-intensity positive and negative stimuli, respectively, relative to off stimulation.
We also show that the change in severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms pre- versus post-operatively interacts with both DBS and valence ratings.
We show that stimulation of the associative-limbic STN might influence the negative cognitive bias in OCD and decreasing the negative appraisal of emotional stimuli with a possible relationship with clinical outcomes.
That the effect is specific to low intensity might suggest a role of uncertainty or conflict related to competing interpretations of image intensity.
These findings may have implications for the therapeutic efficacy of DBS.

Producing and perceiving music engage a wide range of sensorimotor, cognitive, and emotional processes.
Emotions are a central feature of the enjoyment of music, with a large variety of affective states consistently reported by people while listening to music.
However, besides joy or sadness, music often elicits feelings of wonder, nostalgia, or tenderness, which do not correspond to emotion categories typically studied in neuroscience and whose neural substrates remain largely unknown.
Here we review the similarities and differences in the neural substrates underlying these "complex" music-evoked emotions relative to other more "basic" emotional experiences.
We suggest that these emotions emerge through a combination of activation in emotional and motivational brain systems (e.g., including reward pathways) that confer its valence to music, with activation in several other areas outside emotional systems, including motor, attention, or memory-related regions.
We then discuss the neural substrates underlying the entrainment of cognitive and motor processes by music and their relation to affective experience.
These effects have important implications for the potential therapeutic use of music in neurological or psychiatric diseases, particularly those associated with motor, attention, or affective disturbances.

In this article we propose a psychobiological model that construes PTSD fundamentally as a disorder of affect arousal regulation.
Neuroimaging studies of emotion regulation in psychologically healthy populations are initially reviewed as a framework for interpreting the results of previously published investigations of the neural correlates of PTSD reexperiencing and dissociation.
We then apply the emotion regulation framework toward understanding other perturbed affective states in PTSD.
We conclude by discussing the clinical significance of this framework for psychological assessment and treatment of posttrauma psychopathology.

The present work investigated the effects of participant emotional state on global versus local memory for map-based information.
Participants were placed into one of four emotion induction groups, crossing high and low arousal with positive and negative valence, or a control group.
They then studied a university campus map and completed two memory tests, free recall and spatial statement verification.
Converging evidence from these two tasks demonstrated that arousal amplifies symbolic distance effects and leads to a globally-focused spatial mental representation, partially at the expense of local knowledge.
These results were found for both positively- and negatively-valenced affective states.
The present study is the first investigation of emotional effects on spatial memory, and has implications for theories of emotion and spatial cognition.

Emotional empathy-feeling another person's affective states-entails simulating how one would feel in the same circumstance.
Prior research has implicated the role of executive controls and shown a link between visuospatial perspective taking and personal disposition of empathy.
No study has investigated how executive control processes involved in perspective shifting relate to emotional empathy.
Incorporating a spatial perspective-taking task in a set switch paradigm, we investigated whether swiftly switching from the altercentric to the egocentric perspective is associated with heightened emotional empathy but not with accurate classification of low-level perceptual affective cues.
Emotional empathy was measured by subjective ratings of arousal and the similarity of affective states with the target person when viewing photos of a person in an emotionally charged context.
Cognitive empathy was measured by correct recognition of affective cues.
Our results showed that executive controls in perspective shifting related to emotional empathy but not to cognitive empathy.
Emotional empathy correlated negatively with the switch cost from the altercentric to the egocentric perspective and not vice versa.
Faster switching from the altercentric to the egocentric perspective was associated with heightened emotional empathy.
Moreover, the processing strategy did not moderate the association.
Flexibility in perspective shifting, especially in regaining one's own perspective after taking another person's perspective, is critical for emotional empathy.
To feel another person's affective states, one should regain self-perspective after walking in the other person's shoes.

Circadian_Rhythms
======================================================================
30523071

Circadian rhythms are endogenously generated recurring patterns of around 24 hours with well-established roles in physiology and behaviour.
These circadian clocks are important in both the aetiology and treatment of various psychiatric and metabolic diseases.
To maintain physiological homeostasis and optimal functioning, living life synchronised to these clocks is desirable; modern society, however, promotes a '24/7' lifestyle where activity often occurs during the body's 'biological night', resulting in mistimed sleep and circadian misalignment.
This circadian desynchrony can increase the risk of disease and can also influence treatment response.
Clinicians should be aware of the influence that circadian desynchrony can have on health and disease, in order to potentially develop new therapeutic strategies and to incorporate chronotherapeutics into current treatment strategies to enhance their utility.

BACKGROUND: Research within the last decade has shown melatonin to have previously-unsuspected beneficial actions on the peripheral reproductive organs.
Likewise, numerous investigations have documented that stable circadian rhythms are also helpful in maintaining reproductive health.
The relationship of melatonin and circadian rhythmicity to maternal and fetal health is summarized in this review.
METHODS: Databases were searched for the related published English literature up to 15 May 2013.
The search terms used in various combinations included melatonin, circadian rhythms, biological clock, suprachiasmatic nucleus, ovary, pregnancy, uterus, placenta, fetus, pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, ischemia-reperfusion, chronodisruption, antioxidants, oxidative stress and free radicals.
The results of the studies uncovered are summarized herein.
RESULTS: Both melatonin and circadian rhythms impact reproduction, especially during pregnancy.
Melatonin is a multifaceted molecule with direct free radical scavenging and indirect antioxidant activities.
Melatonin is produced in both the ovary and in the placenta where it protects against molecular mutilation and cellular dysfunction arising from oxidative/nitrosative stress.
The placenta, in particular, is often a site of excessive free radical generation due to less than optimal adhesion to the uterine wall, which leads to either persistent hypoxia or intermittent hypoxia and reoxygenation, processes that cause massive free radical generation and organ dysfunction.
This may contribute to pre-eclampsia and other disorders which often complicate pregnancy.
Melatonin has ameliorated free radical damage to the placenta and to the fetus in experiments using non-human mammals.
Likewise, the maintenance of a regular maternal light/dark and sleep/wake cycle is important to stabilize circadian rhythms generated by the maternal central circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nuclei.
Optimal circadian rhythmicity in the mother is important since her circadian clock, either directly or indirectly via the melatonin rhythm, programs the developing master oscillator of the fetus.
Experimental studies have shown that disturbed maternal circadian rhythms, referred to as chronodisruption, and perturbed melatonin cycles have negative consequences for the maturing fetal oscillators, which may lead to psychological and behavioral problems in the newborn.
To optimize regular circadian rhythms and prevent disturbances of the melatonin cycle during pregnancy, shift work and bright light exposure at night should be avoided, especially during the last trimester of pregnancy.
Finally, melatonin synergizes with oxytocin to promote delivery of the fetus.
Since blood melatonin levels are normally highest during the dark period, the propensity of childbirth to occur at night may relate to the high levels of melatonin at this time which work in concert with oxytocin to enhance the strength of uterine contractions.
CONCLUSIONS: A number of conclusions naturally evolve from the data summarized in this review: (i) melatonin, of both pineal and placental origin, has essential functions in fetal maturation and placenta/uterine homeostasis; (ii) circadian clock genes, which are components of all cells including those in the peripheral reproductive organs, have important roles in reproductive and organismal (fetal and maternal) physiology; (iii) due to the potent antioxidant actions of melatonin, coupled with its virtual absence of toxicity, this indoleamine may have utility in the treatment of pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, placental and fetal ischemia/reperfusion, etc (iv) the propensity for parturition to occur at night may relate to the synergism between the nocturnal increase in melatonin and oxytocin.

The insect antennae receive olfactory information from the environment.
In some insects, it has been shown that antennal responsiveness is dynamically regulated by circadian clocks.
However, it is unknown how general this phenomenon is and what functions it serves.
Circadian regulation in honeybee workers is particularly interesting in this regard because they show natural task-related chronobiological plasticity.
Forager bees show strong circadian rhythms in behavior and brain gene expression, whereas nurse bees tend brood around-the-clock and have attenuated circadian rhythms in activity and whole-brain gene expression.
Here, we tested the hypothesis that there is task-related plasticity in circadian rhythms of antennal responsiveness to odorants in worker honeybees.
We used electroantennogram (EAG) to measure the antennal responsiveness of nurses and foragers to general odorants and pheromones around the day.
The capacity to track 10-Hz odorant pulses varied with time of day for both task groups but with different phases.
The antennal pulse-tracking capacity was higher during the subjective day for the day-active foragers, whereas it was better during the night for around-the-clock active nurses.
The task-related phases of pulse-tracking rhythms were similar for all the tested stimuli.
We also found evidence for circadian rhythms in the EAG response magnitude of foragers but not of nurses.
To the best of our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence for circadian regulation of antennal olfactory responsiveness and odorant pulse-tracking capacity in bees or any other hymenopteran insect.
Importantly, our study shows for the first time that the circadian phase of olfactory responsiveness may be socially regulated.

Potassium Channel Interacting Protein 2 (KChIP2) is suggested to be responsible for the circadian rhythm in repolarization duration, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death.
We investigated the hypothesis that there is no circadian rhythm in QT interval in the absence of KChIP2.
Implanted telemetric devices recorded electrocardiogram continuously for 5 days in conscious wild-type mice (WT, n = 9) and KChIP2(-/-) mice (n = 9) in light:dark periods and in complete darkness.
QT intervals were determined from all RR intervals and corrected for heart rate (QT100 = QT/(RR/100)(1/2)).
Moreover, QT intervals were determined from complexes within the RR range of mean-RR +/- 1% in the individual mouse (QTmean-RR).
We find that RR intervals are 125 +/- 5 ms in WT and 123 +/- 4 ms in KChIP2(-/-) (p = 0.81), and QT intervals are 52 +/- 1 and 52 +/- 1 ms, respectively(p = 0.89).
No ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac deaths were observed.
We find similar diurnal (light:dark) and circadian (darkness) rhythms of RR intervals in WT and KChIP2(-/-) mice.
Circadian rhythms in QT100 intervals are present in both groups, but at physiological small amplitudes: 1.6 +/- 0.2 and 1.0 +/- 0.3 ms in WT and KChIP2(-/-), respectively (p = 0.15).
A diurnal rhythm in QT100 intervals was only found in WT mice.
QTmean-RR intervals display clear diurnal and circadian rhythms in both WT and KChIP2(-/-).
The amplitude of the circadian rhythm in QTmean-RR is 4.0 +/- 0.3 and 3.1 +/- 0.5 ms in WT and KChIP2(-/-), respectively (p = 0.16).
In conclusion, KChIP2 expression does not appear to underlie the circadian rhythm in repolarization duration.

Dysfunction in 24-h circadian rhythms is a common occurrence in ageing adults; however, circadian rhythm disruptions are more severe in people with age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, and Parkinson's disease.
Manifestations of circadian rhythm disruptions differ according to the type and severity of neurodegenerative disease and, for some patients, occur before the onset of typical clinical symptoms of neurodegeneration.
Evidence from preliminary studies suggest that circadian rhythm disruptions, in addition to being a symptom of neurodegeneration, might also be a potential risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, and Parkinson's disease, although large, longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this relationship.
The mechanistic link between circadian rhythms and neurodegeneration is still not fully understood, although proposed underlying pathways include alterations of protein homoeostasis and immune and inflammatory function.
While preliminary clinical studies are promising, more studies of circadian rhythm disruptions and its mechanisms are required.
Furthermore, clinical trials are needed to determine whether circadian interventions could prevent or delay the onset of neurodegenerative diseases.

Very recently, the European Parliament, called to decide on possible abolition of the Daylight Saving Time (DST), approved a resolution calling the scientific community to conduct a more in-depth evaluation.
The question is based on disruption of body's circadian rhythms.
We review here the relationship between DST and cardiovascular health.
The available evidence suggests the existence of an association between DST and a modest increase of occurrence of acute myocardial infarction, especially in the first week after the spring shift.
Possible mechanisms include sleep deprivation, circadian misalignment and environmental conditions.
The role of gender and individual preference in circadian rhythms (chronotype) will need further assessment.

PURPOSE: We evaluated nocturnal urine production and circadian rhythms of renal function (glomerular filtration, and water and solute diuresis) in adults with spinal cord injury compared to controls.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective observational study was done at Ghent University Hospital, Belgium.
Participants were asked to perform a 24-hour urine collection.
A blood sample was taken to calculate the diuresis rate and the renal clearance of creatinine, free water, solutes, sodium and urea.
RESULTS: A total of 119 patients were divided into 32 with spinal cord injury, and 68 controls with and 19 without nocturnal polyuria.
Spinal cord injured patients showed no circadian rhythms in the diuresis rate or in the renal clearance of creatinine, free water, solutes, sodium or urea.
Controls without nocturnal polyuria reported a lower nighttime diuresis rate and lower nighttime clearance of creatinine, solutes, sodium and urea compared to daytime levels.
Controls with nocturnal polyuria had no circadian rhythms in the diuresis rate or creatinine clearance and a significant increase in nocturnal free water clearance compared to daytime levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Comparing the mechanisms underlying nocturnal urine production between patients with spinal cord injury and controls revealed important differences.
Spinal cord injured patients showed absent circadian rhythms in the renal clearance of creatinine (glomerular filtration), free water (water diuresis) and solutes such as sodium and urea (solute diuresis).
Future research must be done to evaluate the role of patient stratification to find the most effective and safe treatment or combination of treatments for spinal cord injured patients with complaints or complications related to nocturnal polyuria.

Depressive disorders are associated with various neurobiological alterations like hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, altered neuroplasticity and altered circadian rhythms.
Relating to the circadian symptoms, a process is adopted in which individual genetic factors together with social, psychological and physical stressors may lead to a decompensation of the circadian system.
The causal connections between depressive disorders and disturbed circadian rhythms have not been completely clarified.
Chronobiological therapy is based on these disturbed processes.
For the treatment of the circadian symptoms, various scientifically tested chronotherapeutics are available with however different effectiveness and evidence like light therapy or sleep deprivation.
The successful treatment of depression also frequently leads to a improvement in altered circadian rhythm.

Circadian rhythms have been identified in multiple physiological processes that may affect cardiovascular diseases, yet little is known about the impact of circadian rhythm on acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) onset and outcomes in the Middle East.
The relationship between time of symptom onset during the 24-hour circadian cycle and prehospital delays and in-hospital death was assessed in 2909 patients with STEMI presenting in 6 Arabian Gulf countries.
A sinusoidal smoothing function was used to show the average circadian trends.
There was a significant association between time of symptom onset and the circadian cycle.
The STEMIs were more frequent during the late morning and early afternoon hours ( P < .001).
Patients with pain onset from 0.00 to 5:59 had median prehospital delays of 150 minutes versus 90 minutes from 6:00 to 11:59 and 12:00 to 17:59, respectively ( P < .001).
Although there was no significant difference in mortality between the 4 groups ( P = .230), there was a significant association between time of symptom onset as sinusoidal function and in-hospital mortality ( P = .032).
Patients with STEMI in the Middle East have significant circadian patterns in symptoms onset, prehospital delay, and timeliness of reperfusion.
A circadian rhythm of in-hospital mortality was found over the 24-hour clock of symptom onset time.

Rhythms can be observed at all levels of the biologic integration in humans.
The observation that a biological or physiological variable shows a circadian rhythm can be explained by several multifactorial systems including external (exogenous), internal (endogenous) and psychobiological (lifestyle) mechanisms.
Our body clock can be synchronized with the environment by external factors, called "synchronizers", i.e., the light-dark cycle, but it is also negatively influenced by some pathological conditions or factors, called "chronodisruptors," i.e., aging or low physical activity (PA).
The desynchronization of a 24-h rhythm in a chronic manner has been recently defined "chronodisruption" or "circadian disruption."
A very large number of hormonal variables, such as adrenal and gonadal stress steroids, are governed by circadian rhythmicity.
Such hormones, in normal conditions, show a peak in the first part of the day, while their typical diurnal fluctuations are totally out of sync in subjects affected by cancer or metabolic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome.
In general, a flatter slope with altered peaks in cortisol and testosterone circadian rhythms has been observed in pathological individuals.
PA, specifically chronic exercise, seems to play a key role as synchronizer for the whole circadian system in such pathologies even if specific data on steroids circadian pattern are still sparse and contradictory.
Recently, it has been proposed that low-intensity chronic PA could be an effective intervention to decrease morning cortisol levels in pathological subjects.
The standardization of all confounding factors is needed to reach more clear evidence-based results.

The "Mexican volcano mouse" Neotomodon alstoni, is endemic of the Transverse Neovolcanic Ridge in central Mexico.
It is considered as least concern species and has been studied as a potential laboratory model from different perspectives.
Two lines of research in neuroendocrinology have been addressed: reproduction and parental care, particularly focused on paternal attention and the influence of testosterone, and studies on physiology and behavior of circadian rhythms, focused on the circadian biology of the species, its circadian locomotor activity and daily neuroendocrine regulation of metabolic parameters related to energy balance.
Some mice, when captive, spontaneously develop obesity, which allows for comparisons between lean and obese mice of daily changes in neuronal and metabolic parameters associated with changes in food intake and locomotor activity.
This review includes studies that consider this species an attractive animal model where the alteration of circadian rhythms influences the pathogenesis of obesity, specifically with the basic regulation of food intake and metabolism and differences related to sex.
This study can be considered as a reference to the comparative animal physiology among rodents.

As an ectothermic animal, crayfish immunity and their resistance to pathogen can be significantly affected by environmental factors such as light and temperature.
It has been found for a long time that multiple immune parameters of animals and human are circadian-regulated by light-entrained circadian rhythm.
Whether temperature also affects the immune rhythm of animals still remains unclear.
In the present study, we investigated the effect of temperature cycles on the rhythm of crayfish immunity and their resistance.
Survival experiments demonstrated that temperature cycles of 24 degrees C and 18 degrees C effectively entrained the circadian rhythm of crayfish resistance to Aeromonas hydrophila in constant dark.
After being exposed to temperature cycles, the crayfish injected at different time points exhibited significant difference in resistance to A. hydrophila.
Bacterial growth and total hemocyte count (THC) also showed circadian variation in crayfish subjected to temperature cycles, but phenoloxidase (PO) activity didn't show rhythmic change under the same conditions.
Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that basal expression of crustin1 and astacidin in crayfish subjected to temperature cycles was circadian-rhythmic, but induced expression by A. hydrophila didn't show the same rhythm.
In contrast, crayfish maintained at constant temperature showed completely arrhythmic in bacterial resistance, immune parameters mentioned above and the expression of antimicrobial peptides.
The results present here collectively indicated that temperature cycles entrained circadian rhythm of some immune parameters and shaped crayfish resistance to bacteria.

Disordered circadian rhythms are associated with various psychiatric conditions and metabolic diseases.
We recently established a mouse model of a psychophysiological stress-induced chronic sleep disorder (CSD) characterized by reduced amplitude of circadian wheel-running activity and sleep-wake cycles, sleep fragmentation and hyperphagia.
Here, we evaluate day-night fluctuations in plasma concentrations of free amino acids (FAA), appetite hormones and prolactin as well as the hepatic expression of circadian clock-related genes in mice with CSD (CSD mice).
Nocturnal increases in wheel-running activity and circadian rhythms of plasma prolactin concentrations were significantly disrupted in CSD mice.
Hyperphagia with a decreased leptin/ghrelin ratio was found in CSD mice.
Day-night fluctuations in plasma FAA contents were severely disrupted without affecting total FAA levels in CSD mice.
Nocturnal increases in branched-chain amino acids such as Ile, Leu, and Val were further augmented in CSD mice, while daytime increases in Gly, Ala, Ser, Thr, Lys, Arg, His, Tyr, Met, Cys, Glu, and Asn were significantly attenuated.
Importantly, the circadian expression of hepatic clock genes was completely unaffected in CSD mice.
These findings suggest that circadian clock gene expression does not always reflect disordered behavior and sleep rhythms and that plasma FFA profiles could serve as a potential biomarker of circadian rhythm disorders.

The circadian clock is an endogenous timing system based on the self-sustained oscillation in individual cells.
These cellular circadian clocks compose a multicellular circadian system working at respective levels of tissue, organ, plant body.
However, how numerous cellular clocks are coordinated within a plant has been unclear.
There was little information about behavior of circadian clocks at a single-cell level due to the difficulties in monitoring circadian rhythms of individual cells in an intact plant.
We developed a single-cell bioluminescence imaging system using duckweed as the plant material and succeeded in observing behavior of cellular clocks in intact plants for over a week.
This imaging technique quantitatively revealed heterogeneous and independent manners of cellular clock behaviors.
Furthermore, these quantitative analyses uncovered the local synchronization of cellular circadian rhythms that implied phase-attractive interactions between cellular clocks.
The cell-to-cell interaction looked to be too weak to coordinate cellular clocks against their heterogeneity under constant conditions.
On the other hand, under light-dark conditions, the heterogeneity of cellular clocks seemed to be corrected by cell-to-cell interactions so that cellular clocks showed a clear spatial pattern of phases at a whole plant level.
Thus, it was suggested that the interactions between cellular clocks was an adaptive trait working under day-night cycles to coordinate cellular clocks in a plant body.
These findings provide a novel perspective for understanding spatio-temporal architectures in the plant circadian system.

Aged animals exhibit diminished circadian rhythms, and both aging and circadian disruption sensitize neuroinflammatory responses.
Microglia-the innate immune cell of the central nervous system-possess endogenous timekeeping mechanisms that regulate immune responses.
Here, we explored whether aging is associated with disrupted diurnal rhythms in microglia and neuroinflammatory processes.
First, hippocampal microglia isolated from young rats (4 months F344XBN) rhythmically expressed circadian clock genes, whereas microglia isolated from the hippocampus of aged rats (25 months) had aberrant Per1 and Per2 rhythms.
Unstimulated microglia from young rats exhibited robust rhythms of TNFalpha and IL-1beta mRNA expression, whereas those from aged rats had flattened and tonically elevated cytokine expression.
Similarly, microglial activation markers were diurnally regulated in the hippocampus of young but not aged rats and diurnal differences in responsiveness to both ex vivo and in vivo inflammatory challenges were abolished in aged rats.
Corticosterone is an entraining signal for extra-suprachiasmatic nucleus circadian rhythms.
Here, corticosterone stimulation elicited similar Per1 induction in aged and young microglia.
Overall, these results indicate that aging dysregulates circadian regulation of neuroinflammatory functions.

Physical exercise is a non-pharmacological treatment for affective disorders.
The mechanisms of its effects are unknown although some suggest a relationship to synchronization of circadian rhythms.
One way to explore mechanisms is to utilize animal models.
We previously demonstrated that the diurnal fat sand rat is an advantageous model for studying the interactions between photoperiods and mood.
The current study was designed to evaluate the effects of voluntary exercise on activity rhythms and anxiety and depression-like behaviors in sand rats as a step towards better understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
Male sand rats were housed in short photoperiod (SP; 5h light/19 h dark) or neutral light (NP; 12h light/12h dark) regimens for 3 weeks and divided into subgroups with or without running wheels.
Activity was monitored for 3 additional weeks and then animals were tested in the elevated plus-maze, the forced swim test and the social interaction test.
Activity rhythms were enhanced by the running wheels.
As hypothesized, voluntary exercise had significant effects on SP animals' anxiety- and depression-like behaviors but not on NP animals.
Results are discussed in the context of interactions between physical exercise, circadian rhythms and mood.
We suggest that the sand rat model can be used to explore the underlying mechanism of the effects of physical exercise for mood disorders.

The circadian clock is a transcriptional network that functions to regulate the expression of genes important in the anticipation of changes in cellular and organ function.
Recent studies have revealed that the recognition of pathogens and subsequent initiation of inflammatory responses are strongly regulated by a macrophage-intrinsic circadian clock.
We hypothesized that the circadian pattern of gene expression might be influenced by inflammatory stimuli and that loss of circadian function in immune cells can promote pro-inflammatory behavior.
To investigate circadian rhythms in inflammatory cells, peritoneal macrophages were isolated from mPer2luciferase transgenic mice and circadian oscillations were studied in response to stimuli.
Using Cosinor analysis, we found that LPS significantly altered the circadian period in peritoneal macrophages from mPer2luciferase mice while qPCR data suggested that the pattern of expression of the core circadian gene (Bmal1) was disrupted.
Inhibition of TLR4 offered protection from the LPS-induced impairment in rhythm, suggesting a role for toll-like receptor signaling.
To explore the mechanisms involved, we inhibited LPS-stimulated NO and superoxide.
Inhibition of NO synthesis with L-NAME had no effect on circadian rhythms.
In contrast, inhibition of superoxide with Tempol or PEG-SOD ameliorated the LPS-induced changes in circadian periodicity.
In gain of function experiments, we found that overexpression of NOX5, a source of ROS, could significantly disrupt circadian function in a circadian reporter cell line (U2OS) whereas iNOS overexpression, a source of NO, was ineffective.
To assess whether alteration of circadian rhythms influences macrophage function, peritoneal macrophages were isolated from Bmal1-KO and Per-TKO mice.
Compared to WT macrophages, macrophages from circadian knockout mice exhibited altered balance between NO and ROS release, increased uptake of oxLDL and increased adhesion and migration.
These results suggest that pro-inflammatory stimuli can disrupt circadian rhythms in macrophages and that impaired circadian rhythms may contribute to cardiovascular diseases by altering macrophage behavior.

BACKGROUND: Migraine is considered a disease with diurnal and 24 h pattern, though the existence of a prevalent circadian rhythm associated to migraine frequency and severity is still not clear.
This observational cross-sectional study aimed to: assess the circadian rhythm of migraine attacks onset in a large patients' population selected in a headache center and including episodic and chronic migraine analyze the principal characteristic of the different onset time groups verify if migraine features, particularly those associated to chronic and disabling migraine, could be discriminant factors for time of onset group.
METHODS: We selected 786 consecutive migraine outpatients, who correctly completed the headache diaries for 3 consecutive months and who fulfilled the diagnosis of migraine without aura-MO, migraine with typical aura alone or associated to migraine without aura - MO/MA and chronic migraine - CM.
For the time of headache onset, we considered four time slots, from 6 to 12 am (morning), from 1 to 6 pm (afternoon), from 7 to 11 pm (evening), from 12 pm to 5 am (night), and an additional category named "any time".
Each time slot included the 60 min preceding the next one (e.g an onset at 12.30 am was included in 6-12 am time slot).
We evaluated in all patients the pericranial tenderness, anxiety and depression tracts, headache-related disability, sleep features, quality of life, allodynia and fatigue.
RESULTS: We scored a total of 16,578 attacks, distributed in the entire day.
The most of patients, including CM, satisfied the criteria for the "any time" onset.
Night onset was significantly less represented in the MA/MO group.
Patients with prevalent night onset were significantly older, with longer migraine history and shorter sleep duration.
Age and illness duration were the variables discriminating the different onset time groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The most of migraine patients do not report a specific circadian profile of attacks occurrence.
Frequent migraine, severe disability, psychopathological tracts as well as central sensitization signs, do not match with a specific circadian rhythm of attacks onset.
Night onset migraine seems to be an age related feature, emerging in the course of the disease.

We studied the age-related features of circadian rhythms of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activity in the liver of rats under light deprivation.
In standard light conditions (LD), significant daily fluctuations in SOD activity with a maximum at 07:00 am was detected only in young animals (1,5 months) but catalase activity was observed in young (1,5 months) and in adults (7,5 months) with peak at 04:00 am.
The daily dynamics of total and specific activity of SOD and catalase in the liver in young and adult rats differed depending on the period of ontogeny in which the impact of light deprivation began.
When the females and offspring were moved to darkness after birth (group LD/DD), the circadian rhythms of SOD and catalase activitys were observed in young and were absent in adult rats.
However, circadian rhythms of the antioxidant enzymes (AOE) activities were inherent only adult rats when light deprivation impacted on pregnant females (group DD/DD).
Changes in circadian rhythms under light deprivation were characterized either by a phase shift of the enzymes activity (in the LD/DD group) or by a violation of their develpoment in ontogeny (in the DD/DD group).
During aging significant decreasing of catalase activity was compensated by an increase in the amplitude of circadian rhythms of activity of this enzyme in animals of all groups.
A distinctive feature of daily fluctuations in AOcapital IE, Cyrillic activity in young rats in LD and LD/DD groups can be considered the presence of an ultradian rhythm in the general circadian cycle, which had a second peak with a smaller amplitude and shorter period.

The plant circadian clock controls various physiological phenomena that are important for adaptation to natural day-night cycles.
Many components of the circadian clock have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana, the model plant for molecular genetic studies.
Recent studies revealed evolutionary conservation of clock components in green plants.
Homologues of clock-related genes have been isolated from Lemna gibba and Lemna aequinoctialis, and it has been demonstrated that these homologues function in the clock system in a manner similar to their functioning in Arabidopsis.
While clock components are widely conserved, circadian phenomena display diversity even within the Lemna genus.
In order to survey the full extent of diversity in circadian rhythms among duckweed plants, we characterised the circadian rhythms of duckweed by employing a semi-transient bioluminescent reporter system.
Using a particle bombardment method, circadian bioluminescent reporters were introduced into nine strains representing five duckweed species: Spirodela polyrhiza, Landoltia punctata, Lemna gibba, L. aequinoctialis and Wolffia columbiana.
We then monitored luciferase (luc+) reporter activities driven by AtCCA1, ZmUBQ1 or CaMV35S promoters under entrainment and free-running conditions.
Under entrainment, AtCCA1::luc+ showed similar diurnal rhythms in all strains.
This suggests that the mechanism of biological timing under day-night cycles is conserved throughout the evolution of duckweeds.
Under free-running conditions, we observed circadian rhythms of AtCCA1::luc+, ZmUBQ1::luc+ and CaMV35S::luc+.
These circadian rhythms showed diversity in period length and sustainability, suggesting that circadian clock mechanisms are somewhat diversified among duckweeds.

Circadian rhythms are biorhythms with a 24-hour period that are regulated by molecular clocks.
Several clinical and animal models have been developed to analyze the role of these rhythms in cardiovascular physiology, disease and therapy, but a convenient in vitro model that mimics both molecular and functional circadian effects of the heart is not available.
Therefore, we established a neonatal rat cardiomyocyte model that recapitulates in vivo circadian rhythmicity, as measured by anti-phasic oscillatory mRNA expression of two core clock genes, Bmal1 and Per2 and that shows functional dependence on the clock as indicated by an oscillating response in apoptosis induced by doxorubicin, hydroperoxide or hypoxia.
In addition, perturbation of the cardiac clock by the use of several compounds including Resveratrol and Ex-527 was found to result in loss of functional rhythmicity.
This indicates that neonatal rat cardiomyocytes are a good model to investigate the cardiac circadian clock as well as a system that allows for fast and easy preclinical testing of the influence of compounds on circadian rhythmicity that might have crucial effects on cardiac health.

Circadian rhythm abnormalities have been recognized as a central feature of bipolar disorder (BD) but a coherent biological explanation for them remains lacking.
Using genetic mutation of 'clock genes', robust animal models of mania and depression have been developed that elucidate key aspects of circadian rhythms and the circadian clock-mood connection.
However, translation of this knowledge into humans remains incomplete.
In recent years, very large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted and the genetic underpinnings of BD are beginning to emerge.
However, these genetic studies in BD do not match well with the evidence from animal studies that implicate the circadian clock in mood regulation.
Even larger GWAS have been conducted for circadian phenotypes including chronotype, rhythm amplitude, sleep duration, and insomnia.
These studies have identified a diverse set of associated genes, including a minority with previously well-characterized functions in the circadian clock.
Taken together, the data from recent GWAS of BD and circadian phenotypes indicate that the genetic organization of the circadian clock, both in health and in BD is complex.
The findings from GWAS elucidate potentially novel circadian mechanism that may be partly distinct from those identified in animal models.
Pleiotropy, epistasis and nongenetic factors may play important roles in regulating circadian rhythms, some of which may underlie circadian rhythm disturbances in BD.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We review recent evidence for circadian rhythm dysregulation in bipolar spectrum disorders (BSDs).
We examine evidence for endogenous abnormalities in the biological clock and disruptions in the external entrainment of circadian rhythms in BSDs.
We also address whether circadian dysregulation provides vulnerability to onset of BSD and evidence for a new integration of reward and circadian dysregulation in BSD.
RECENT FINDINGS: Relative circadian phase delay (e.g., later melatonin peak, evening chronotype) is associated with BSD, particularly in the depressive phase.
More consistent evidence supports irregularity of social rhythms, sleep/wake and activity patterns, and disruptions of social rhythms by life events, as stable trait markers of BSD and potential vulnerabilities for BSD onset.
Growing research supports an integrative reward/circadian model.
Both endogenous abnormalities in the biological clock pacemaking function and disruptions in the external entrainment of circadian rhythms by physical and social cues are involved in BSDs.
Circadian dysregulation may provide vulnerability to BSD onset.

Presently, about 12% of the population is 65 years or older and by the year 2030 that figure is expected to reach 21%.
In order to promote the well-being of the elderly and to reduce the costs associated with health care demands, increased longevity should be accompanied by ageing attenuation.
Energy restriction, which limits the amount of energy consumed to 60-70% of the daily intake, and intermittent fasting, which allows the food to be available ad libitum every other day, extend the life span of mammals and prevent or delay the onset of major age-related diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and cataracts.
Recently, we have shown that well-being can be achieved by resetting of the circadian clock and induction of robust catabolic circadian rhythms via timed feeding.
In addition, the clock mechanism regulates metabolism and major metabolic proteins are key factors in the core clock mechanism.
Therefore, it is necessary to increase our understanding of circadian regulation over metabolism and longevity and to design new therapies based on this regulation.
This review will explore the present data in the field of circadian rhythms, ageing and metabolism.

Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common clinical phenomenon characterized by cognitive deficits in patients after anesthesia and surgery.
Advanced age is a significant independent risk factor for POCD.
We previously reported that in young mice, sleep-wake rhythm is involved in the isoflurane-induced memory impairment.
In present study, we sought to determine whether advanced age increased the risk of POCD through aggravated and prolonged post-anesthetic circadian disruption in the elderly.
We constructed POCD model by submitting the mice to 5-h 1.3% isoflurane anesthesia from Zeitgeber Time (ZT) 14 to ZT19.
Under novel object recognition assay (NOR) and Morris water maze (MWM) test, We found 5-h isoflurane anesthesia impaired the cognition of young mice for early 3 days after anesthesia but damaged the aged for at least 1 week.
With Mini-Mitter continuously monitoring, a 3.22+/-0.75h gross motor activity acrophase delay was manifested in young mice on D1, while in the aged mice, the gross motor activity phase shift lasted for 3 days, consistent with the body temperature rhythm trends of change.
Melatonin has been considered as an effective remedy for circadian rhythm shift.
In aged mice, melatonin was pretreated intragastrically at the dose of 10mg/kg daily for 7 consecutive days before anesthesia.
We found that melatonin prevented isoflurane-induced cognitive impairments by restoring the locomotor activity and temperature circadian rhythm via clock gene resynchronization.
Overall, these results indicated that Long-term isoflurane anesthesia induced more aggravated and prolonged memory deficits and circadian rhythms disruption in aged mice.
Melatonin could prevent isoflurane-induced cognitive impairments by circadian rhythm resynchronization.

In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is the site of the main circadian clock, synchronized by the light-dark cycle, which generates behavioral rhythms like feeding, drinking and activity.
Notwithstanding, the main role of the SCN clock on the control of all circadian rhythms has been questioned due to the presence of clock activity in many brain areas, including those implicated in the regulation of feeding and reward.
Moreover, whether circadian rhythms of particular motivated behaviors exist is unknown.
Here, we evaluated the spontaneous daily and circadian behavior of consumption of a sweet caloric solution (5-10% sucrose), and the effects of sucrose intake on the expression of clock genes in the mouse brain.
Mice showed a daily (in a light-dark cycle) and a circadian (in constant darkness conditions) rhythm in the intake and sucrose preference with a rise for both parameters at night (or subjective night).
In addition, we observed changes in the circadian day-night expression of the clock gene Per2 in the SCN, cortex and striatum of animals ingesting sucrose compared to control mice on pure water.
Finally, daily rhythms of sucrose intake and preference were abolished in Per2(Brdm1)- and double Per1(-/-)Per2(Brdm1)-mutant animals.
These data indicate that the expression of circadian rhythms of hedonic feeding behaviors may be controlled by brain circadian clocks and Per gene expression.

The avian pineal gland, an independent circadian oscillator, receives external photic cues and translates them for the rhythmical synthesis of melatonin.
Our previous study found that monochromatic green light could increase the secretion of melatonin and expression of CLOCK and BMAL1 in chick pinealocytes.
This study further investigated the role of BMAL1 and CLOCK in monochromatic green light-induced melatonin secretion in chick pinealocytes using siRNAs interference and overexpression techniques.
The results showed that si-BMAL1 destroyed the circadian rhythms of AANAT and melatonin, along with the disruption of the expression of all the seven clock genes, except CRY1.
Furthermore, overexpression of BMAL1 also disturbed the circadian rhythms of AANAT and melatonin, in addition to causing arrhythmic expression of BMAL1 and CRY1/2, but had no effect on the circadian rhythms of CLOCK, BMAL2 and PER2/3.
The knockdown or overexpression of CLOCK had no impact on the circadian rhythms of AANAT, melatonin, BMAL1 and PER2, but it significantly deregulated the circadian rhythms of CLOCK, BMAL2, CRY1/2 and PER3.
These results suggested that BMAL1 rather than CLOCK plays a critical role in the regulation of monochromatic green light-induced melatonin rhythm synthesis in chicken pinealocytes.
Moreover, both knockdown and overexpression of BMAL1 could change the expression levels of CRY2, it indicated CRY2 may be involved in the BMAL1 pathway by modulating the circadian rhythms of AANAT and melatonin.

BACKGROUND: The poor prognostic of Bipolar disorders (BD) is closely linked to deaths by suicide.
Sleep and circadian abnormalities are observed during all phases of BD and are also associated with suicide attempt (SA).
In this context, this study sought to identify specific sleep and circadian rhythms markers associated with suicidal attempt in euthymic patients with BD.
METHODS: The sample (N=236) comprised 3 groups: 147 patients with BD including 57 with a history of SA and 90 without (NoSA), and 89 healthy controls (HC).
All participants were recorded during 21 days with actigraphy.
RESULTS: SA was associated with women gender (p=0.03), familial history of SA (p=0.03), mixed episodes (p = 0.001), and benzodiazepines (p = 0.019).
SA, compared to noSA, had a morning phase preference (p=0.04), and were more vigorous on the circadian type inventory (p=0.04), and tended to suffer more from insomnia (45% versus 25% respectively, p=0.10).
SA was also associated with an earlier onset of daily activity assessed with actigraphy (M10 onset: p=0.01).
Backward stepwise linear regression indicated that a combination of four variables (Gender, vigour, insomnia, M10onset) significantly differentiated patients with SA from NoSA (p=0.03).
LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional design, and no examination of suicidal behaviors' subgroups such as first attempters or repeaters, or violent suicide attempt.
CONCLUSIONS: Woman gender, vigorous circadian type, insomnia and an earlier daily activity appeared independently associated with SA in BD.
If these biomarkers are confirmed in prospective studies, they should be screened and used to prevent suicide, with the development of personal and targeted chronobiological treatments.

The aim of this study was to compare the availability of diurnal and nocturnal light in two residences for aged persons (R1 and R2, Palma de Mallorca, Illes Balears, Spain).
We found that the R1 inmates were exposed to lower amounts of light during waking time and higher amounts during sleeping time.
The main traits of the circadian rhythms and the quality of sleep in the inmates of the two residences were found to be positively related to the availability of light during waking time and negatively to the increased light exposure during bed time.
In addition, the sleep of R1 inmates suffered higher disturbances as a consequence of the different policy for nocturnal diapers check and change.
Altogether, these two factors may explain the differences observed in the two residences regarding the circadian rhythms, health status and quality of life.
Two conclusions stem from these results: (1) the circadian rhythms of aged people are particularly sensitive to the contrast between diurnal and nocturnal light and (2) the nursing staff of institutions for aged people must receive specific formation on the best practices for maintaining the circadian health of aged people.

Circadian rhythms of physiology and behavior are widespread\break mechanisms in many organisms.
The internal biological rhythms are driven by molecular clocks, which oscillate with a period nearly but not exactly 24 hours.
Many classic models of circadian rhythms are based on a time-delayed negative feedback, suggested by the protein products inhibiting transcription of their own genes.
In 1999, based on stabilization of PER upon dimerization, Tyson et al [J J Tyson, C I Hong, C D Thron, B Novak, Biophys J 77 (1999) 2411--2417] proposed a crucial positive feedback to the circadian oscillator.
This idea was mathematically expressed in a three-dimensional model.
By imposing assumptions that the dimerization reactions were fast and dimeric proteins were in rapid equilibrium, they reduced the model to a pair of nonlinear ordinary differential equations of mRNA and total protein concentrations.
Then they used phase plane analysis tools to investigate circadian rhythms.
In this paper, the original three-dimensional model is studied.
We explore the existence of oscillations and their periods.
Much attention is paid to investigate how the periods depend on model parameters.
The numerical simulations are in good agreement with their reduced work.

Sibling relational aggression is an important but understudied dimension of sibling relationships that has potential implications for adolescents' adjustment.
This study examined the longitudinal associations between being the target of sibling relational aggression and adolescent adjustment (i.e., depressive symptoms, risky behavior, self-worth, and romantic competence) among younger and older siblings over a three-year period in adolescence.
The moderating roles of birth order, sibling gender, and sibling dyad gender constellation also were tested.
Participants were 196 European American adolescent (firstborn-secondborn) sibling pairs who were 16.47 years (SD = 0.80) and 13.88 years (SD = 1.15) of age, respectively, at the onset of this study.
Data were collected separately from each sibling during home interviews.
Multilevel models revealed that being the target of sibling relational aggression was associated with all four adjustment outcomes at the between-person level, and with risky behavior and romantic competence at the within-person level.
However, some of these effects were moderated by sibling dyad characteristics.
Although often overlooked in the literature on adolescence, sibling relationship dynamics play a key role in youth development and adjustment.

Applying resource control theory and social exchange theory, we examined the social network conditions under which elementary age children were likely to engage in relational aggression.
Data on classroom peer networks and peer-nominated behaviors were collected on 671 second- through fourth-grade children in 34 urban, low-income classrooms.
Nested regression models with robust cluster standard errors demonstrated that the association between children's number of relationships and their levels of relational aggression was moderated by the number of relationships that their affiliates had.
Children with more peer relationships (i.e., higher network centrality) exhibited higher levels of relational aggression, but only when these relationships were with peers who had fewer connections themselves (i.e., poorly connected peers).
This finding remained significant even when controlling for common predictors of relational aggression including gender, overt aggression, prosocial behavior, victimization, social preference, and perceived popularity.
Results are discussed in terms of their implications for advancing the literature on childhood relational aggression and their practical applications for identifying children at risk for these behaviors.

A maternal authoritarian style has been related to the development of physical aggression during childhood and later future social problems; however, not too many studies have detected other than individual or family factors that may buffer this maternal effect.
This work examines whether daycare center attendance may moderate the relationships between a mother authoritarian style and physical aggression.
The study sample was 72 (40 girls) kindergarten children from Spain.
Parents were asked to complete two questionnaires focused on individual family characteristics and parenting styles.
At age 5, children physical aggression was assessed by direct observation at playtime; aggression scores at 6 was obtained by a peer-rated questionnaire.
A least squared multiple regression was performed after controlling for children's level of physical aggression at 5, child sex and siblings.
A positive contribution of maternal authoritarian style on physical aggression was detected.
Daycare center attendance appears to attenuate the effect of the mother's authoritarian style on physical aggression, only in boys.

RESEARCH FINDINGS: The transition to kindergarten has important ramifications for future achievement and psychosocial outcomes.
Research suggests that physical aggression may be related to difficulty during school transitions, yet no studies to date have examined the role of relational aggression in these transitions.
This paper examined how engagement in preschool physical and relational aggression predicted psychosocial adjustment during the kindergarten school year.
Observations and teacher reports of aggression were collected in preschool, and kindergarten teachers reported on student-teacher relationship quality, child internalizing problems, and peer acceptance in kindergarten.
Results suggested that preschool physical aggression predicted reduced peer acceptance and increased conflict with the kindergarten teacher.
High levels of relational aggression, when not combined with physical aggression, were related to more positive transitions to kindergarten in the domains assessed.
PRACTICE OR POLICY: These data lend support to the need for interventions among physically aggressive preschoolers to target not only concurrent behavior but also future aggression and adjustment in kindergarten.
Thus, educators should work to encourage social influence in more prosocial ways amongst aggressive preschoolers.

The present longitudinal study examined the indirect effect of 6th-grade negative friendship quality on the associations between 5th-grade relational aggression and age 15 social-psychological adjustment (i.e., depressive symptoms and risky behavior).
The study consisted of a secondary analysis of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development using 776 children (M = 10.42 years in 5th grade; 50.4% boys) from the original sample.
Using teacher and self-report ratings, relational and physical aggression, friendship quality, depressive symptoms, and risky behavior were measured.
Bootstrapping mediation analyses were conducted.
Negative friendship quality was found to mediate the association between relational aggression and depressive symptoms as well as between relational aggression and risky behavior, when controlling for physical aggression, gender and age.
This longitudinal study identifies possible developmental pathways by which relational aggression and future social psychological adjustment may be linked.

Relational aggression is a form of covert or indirect aggression or bullying in which harm is caused through damage to relationships or social status within a group, rather than through physical violence.
We compare findings from empirical research into relational aggression with the depictions, interpretations and interventions described in trade-books and popular media dealing with that same topic.
Relational aggression is more common and more studied among girls than boys and is popularly described as synonymous with "mean-girl" behaviors.
We investigate the degree that popular trade books and movies accurately portray findings from researched investigations including the incidence and indicators of the condition and its remedies.
We determine that there is a great deal of similarity between these two sources in how relational aggression is understood and how it may be treated.
The concurrence across both dissemination formats reflects terminology and definitions, the harmful effects of relational aggression, the gender-specific nature of the condition to women and girls, its age of occurrence, the impact of parenting styles, its relationship to girls' social competence, and nature of its expression through non-physical means.

This study examined gender differences in the level and developmental course of relational aggression in middle childhood, as well as early predictors and outcomes of relational aggression, after controlling for concurrent physical aggression.
Relational (RAgg) and Physical aggression (PAgg) scores for 558 boys and 545 girls at ages 8-11 in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD) were created by combining the highest rating for each item across mother and teacher reports.
Longitudinal analyses were conducted using Latent Curve Models of RAgg with PAgg as a time-varying covariate, with all parameters allowed to vary by gender.
Boys and girls had different growth parameters of RAgg.
Girls' RAgg intercept was higher and the slope was not different from zero; boys' RAgg intercept was lower and the slope declined.
Mother-child conflict in early childhood predicted RAgg intercept for both boys and girls, but maternal harsh control and sensitivity were also uniquely predictive for girls, whereas center care was uniquely predictive for boys.
RAgg intercept predicted adolescent self-reports of depression for girls and delinquency and risk-taking for both boys and girls; the magnitude of the association with risk-taking was significantly greater for boys.

Relational aggression-a psychological form of aggression-has numerous negative consequences for physical and emotional health.
However, little is known about the risk factors that lead youth to engage in relational aggression.
Using multimethod data from a longitudinal research of 674 Mexican-origin youth, this study examined the influence of parents, siblings, and peers on the development of relational aggression.
Increases in relational aggression from age 10 to 16 were associated with: (a) low levels of parental monitoring and (b) increased association with deviant peers and siblings.
These results held across gender and nativity status.
The findings suggest that multiple socialization agents contribute to the development of relational aggression.
We discuss the practical implications for reducing relational aggression during adolescence.

Intimate partner violence (IPV) is identified as a human rights abuse which happens everywhere regardless of the society and culture.
This study addressed risk markers for physical IPV victimization and perpetration among men and women in Tehran, Iran.
Data were collected from 250 participants (111 men and 139 women) in Tehran who reported perpetrating or experiencing IPV at least once in the past year.
In this article, we sought to understand risk markers for both male and female physical IPV victimization and perpetration and whether these risk markers differed by gender.
We used regression analyses to test two models with males and females separately.
Results indicated that for males, physical aggression perpetration was a significant predictor of physical aggression victimization, and physical aggression victimization, psychological aggression victimization, and psychological aggression perpetration were significant predictors of physical aggression perpetration.
For females, psychological aggression victimization and physical aggression perpetration were significant predictors of physical aggression victimization, and physical aggression victimization and psychological aggression perpetration were significant predictors of physical aggression perpetration.
These results can be helpful in efforts to develop effective interventions for people at risk of IPV in Iran.

A secondary analysis of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development was conducted to test the mechanisms by which relational aggression in third grade was associated both directly and indirectly with relational victimization in sixth grade.
A large sample (N = 1,035; 522 girls; M = 8.3 years old; SD = 0.23) and multiple informants (teacher, child, and parent report) and methods were used to test several theoretically driven hypotheses.
Our path analysis model suggested evidence for both direct and indirect pathways consistent with the sequential social process model of peer harassment.
Relational aggression was significantly associated with future relational victimization even after controlling for physical aggression and gender.
Loneliness mediated the direct association between relational aggression and peer victimization.
A second model testing the reverse direction of effect revealed that relational victimization in third grade predicted relational aggression in sixth grade and was associated with loneliness and depressive symptoms in fifth grade, but there was no evidence for any of the indirect pathways.

A short-term longitudinal study examined relational and physical aggression and deceptive behavior among 120 preschool-aged children (M = 44.36 months old, SD = 11.07).
Multiple informants and methods (i.e., observational, teacher reports) were used.
Evidence for discriminant validity of the observations of aggression subtypes was found.
For example, observations of relational aggression were more highly associated with teacher reports of relational aggression than teacher reports of physical aggression.
Observed relational aggression was significantly associated with concurrent and prospective increases in deceptive behavior, even after controlling for gender and observed physical aggression.
In addition, observed relational aggression was a unique significant predictor of concurrent deception, above and beyond teacher reports of aggression subtypes, which provides important support for the utility of the observational methods.

BACKGROUND: Does poor language ability in early childhood increase the likelihood of physical aggression or is language ability delayed by frequent physical aggression?
This study examined the longitudinal associations between physical aggression and language ability from toddlerhood to early childhood in a population sample while controlling for parenting behaviours, non-verbal intellectual functioning, and children's sex.
METHODS: Children enrolled in the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD) (N = 2, 057) were assessed longitudinally from 17 to 72 months via parent reports and standardized assessments.
RESULTS: The cross-lagged models revealed modest reciprocal associations between physical aggression and language performance from 17 to 41 months but not thereafter.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant associations between physical aggression and poor language ability are minimal and limited to the period when physical aggression and language performance are both substantially increasing.
During that period parenting behaviours may play an important role in supporting language ability while reducing the frequency of physical aggression.
Further studies are needed that utilize multiple assessments of physical aggression, assess multiple domains of language abilities, and that examine the potential mediating role of parenting behaviours between 12 and 48 months.

Previous research has focused primarily on corporal punishment as a cause and adolescents' physical aggression as an outcome.
However, there is a large gap in knowledge of the potentially bidirectional association and explanatory mechanism underlying the association between corporal punishment and physical aggression.
The current study, using a longitudinal design across three time points (the fall semester of 7th grade, the fall of 8th grade, and the fall of 9th grade), aimed to a) examine the reciprocal processes between corporal punishment and physical aggression, and b) explore whether deviant peer affiliation may explain such reciprocal connections.
Only adolescents participating in all the three time points were included in this study, resulting in a final sample of 342 adolescents (175 boys, 167 girls) who completed questionnaires regarding corporal punishment, deviant peer affiliation, and aggression.
Gender, age and socioeconomic status were controlled for in the analyses.
Autoregressive cross-lagged models showed that the results did not support the direct reciprocal effect between corporal punishment and physical aggression among Chinese adolescents.
A direct longitudinal link from corporal punishment to physical aggression was found, however, the inverse association was not significant.
Moreover, regarding the longitudinal underlying process, in one direction, corporal punishment at 7th grade predicted higher levels of deviant peer affiliation at 8th grade.
In turn, higher deviant peer affiliation at 8th grade predicted increased physical aggression at 9th grade.
At the same time, in the other direction, adolescent physical aggression at 7th grade significantly predicted deviant peer affiliation at 8th grade.
In turn, higher deviant peer affiliation at 8th grade predicted decreased corporal punishment at 9th grade.
Identifying the direct and underlying reciprocal processes between corporal punishment and adolescent physical aggression has important implications for an integrative framework of theory and prevention.

Previous research has shown that parents of socially competent young children provide them with elaborative, explicit, appropriate and emotion-laden advice about peer interactions.
The current study analyzed mothers' conversations with preschoolers (N=175; 52% female; M age = 52 months, SD = 7 months) about peer conflicts involving relational aggression.
Conversations were coded for maternal elaboration, emotion references, and discussion of norm violations.
Information about relational and physical aggression was collected from teachers at two assessments approximately 12 months apart for a subsample of 136 children.
Regression analyses, controlling for physical aggression, showed that average and high levels of effective coaching operated as a protective factor against stable high levels of relational aggression.
Theoretical and practical implications for our understanding of the early development of relational aggression are discussed.

Research on relational aggression (indirect and social means of inflicting harm) has previously focused on adolescent populations.
The current study extends this research by exploring both the frequency of perpetrating and being the target of relational aggression as it relates to alcohol use outcomes in a college population.
Further, this study examines whether positive urgency (e.g., acting impulsively in response to positive emotions) and negative urgency (e.g., acting impulsively in response to negative emotions) moderate the relationship between relational aggression and alcohol outcomes.
In this study, 245 college students (65.7% female) completed an online survey.
Results indicated greater frequency of perpetrating relational aggression, higher levels of positive urgency, or higher levels of negative urgency was associated with more negative consequences.
Further, negative urgency moderated the relationship between frequency of perpetrating aggression and consequences such that aggression was more strongly associated with consequences for those high in urgency.
Counter to the adolescent literature, the frequency of being the target of aggression was not associated with more alcohol use.
These findings suggest that perpetrators of relational aggression may be at particular risk for negative alcohol-related consequences when they act impulsively in response to negative, but not positive, emotions.
These students may benefit from interventions exploring alternative ways to cope with negative emotions.

This study investigated the contribution of general normative beliefs about aggression and specific normative beliefs about retaliatory aggression in predicting physical, non-physical and relational aggression.
Adolescents (N = 229) from a low-income community in South Africa completed the Normative Beliefs about Aggression Scale (NOBAGS) and the Aggression-Problem Behaviour Frequency Scale (A-PBFS).
The results revealed significantly higher levels of all forms of aggression amongst boys as compared to girls.
There were significant gender differences in belief-behaviour associations with more significant correlations found among girls.
General beliefs endorsing aggression were positively correlated with physical aggression among girls.
For girls, beliefs about the acceptability of verbal and physical retaliation were associated with relational and non-physical aggression.
The current findings broaden the understanding of the predictors of aggressive behaviour among South African youth.
They emphasise that both general beliefs about aggression and specific beliefs about retaliation predict actual aggressive behaviour.
Significantly, the study emphasizes that there are gender differences in the prediction of aggressive behaviour in terms of normative beliefs.

The purpose of this short-term longitudinal study was to examine Chinese children's trajectories of physical and relational aggression and their association with social-psychological adjustment problems (i.e., depressive symptoms and delinquency) and gender.
Fourth and fifth grade children in Taiwan (n = 739, age 9-11) were followed across 1 year.
Results of Linear Mixed Models demonstrated that, on average, relational aggression increased in a linear fashion for fifth grade children and girls and physical aggression remained stable for boys and increased linearly for fifth grade girls.
Further, increases in relational aggression were associated with time-dependent increases in depressive symptoms, and the effect size of this association seemed to be stronger than that of physical aggression.
Findings are discussed in the context of Chinese culture.

Most researchers on media and aggression have examined the behavioral effects of viewing physical aggression in the media.
Conversely, in the current study, I examined longitudinal associations between viewing relational aggression on TV and subsequent aggressive behavior.
Participants included 467 adolescents who completed a number of different questionnaires involving media and aggression at 3 different time points.
Results revealed that viewing relational aggression on TV was longitudinally associated with future relational aggression.
However, early levels of relational aggression did not predict future exposure to televised relational aggression.
Conversely, there was a bidirectional relationship between TV violence and physical aggression over time.
No longitudinal evidence was found for a general effect of viewing TV, as all significant media effects were specific to the type of aggression viewed.
These results support the general aggression model and suggest that viewing relational aggression in the media can have a long-term effect on aggressive behavior during adolescence.

This study sought to expand on prior research suggesting that children low in peer status who either over- or underestimate their social competence relative to others' reports are more likely to be aggressive (White and Kistner [2011].
Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology, 39, 645-656).
The curvilinear associations between social competence bias and two forms of aggression (physical and relational) were examined in a sample of 4th through 6th graders (n = 183); moderation by both sex and peer status (peer preference and popularity) also were tested.
Social competence bias was operationally defined as the residual difference between child and teacher ratings of the child's social competence.
Aggression and peer status were measured using peer nomination procedures.
There was a significant curvilinear association between social competence bias and physical aggression moderated by both types of peer status.
For low peer status children greater underestimation and overestimation of social competence was associated with higher physical aggression.
The curvilinear association between social competence bias and relational aggression was moderated by both peer status and sex.
Popular boys had higher rates of relational aggression when they had accurate, rather than biased, self-perceptions of social competence.
However, for very highly preferred girls, a more extreme positive bias was associated with an exponential increase in relational aggression.
Results are discussed in terms of implications for aggression theory and intervention.

Exposure to prenatal adversity is associated with aggression later in life.
Individual differences in autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning, specifically nonreciprocal activation of the parasympathetic (PNS) and sympathetic (SNS) nervous systems, increase susceptibility to aggression, especially in the context of adversity.
Previous work examining interactions between early adversity and ANS functioning in infancy is scarce and has not examined interaction between PNS and SNS.
This study examined whether the PNS and SNS moderate the relation between cumulative prenatal risk and early physical aggression in 124 children (57% male).
Cumulative risk (e.g., maternal psychiatric disorder, substance (ab)use, and social adversity) was assessed during pregnancy.
Parasympathetic respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and sympathetic pre-ejection period (PEP) at baseline, in response to and during recovery from emotional challenge were measured at 6 months.
Physical aggression and non-physical aggression/oppositional behavior were measured at 30 months.
The results showed that cumulative prenatal risk predicted elevated physical aggression and non-physical aggression/oppositional behavior in toddlerhood; however, the effects on physical aggression were moderated by PNS and SNS functioning.
Specifically, the effects of cumulative risk on physical aggression were particularly evident in children characterized by low baseline PNS activity and/or by nonreciprocal activity of the PNS and SNS, characterized by decreased activity (i.e., coinhibition) or increased activity (i.e., coactivation) of both systems at baseline and/or in response to emotional challenge.
These findings extend our understanding of the interaction between perinatal risk and infant ANS functioning on developmental outcome.

The association between mothers' psychological control and their children's emotional adjustment problems is well documented.
However, processes that may explain this association are not well understood.
The present study tested the idea that relational aggression and psychological control within the context of the sibling relationship may help to account for the relation between mothers' psychological control and adolescents' internalizing symptoms.
Older (M = 16.46, SD = 1.35 years) and younger (M = 13.67, SD = 1.56 years) siblings from 101 dyads rated the psychological control they received from mothers and siblings, and the relational aggression they received from siblings.
Despite some similarities between psychological control and relational aggression, confirmatory factor analyses provided evidence that the two sibling processes are distinct.
Maternal psychological control was related to psychological control and relational aggression within the sibling relationship, which were related to adolescents' anxiety and depressed mood.
In addition, sibling relational aggression was a more powerful mediator of the relationship between maternal psychological control and adolescent adjustment than sibling psychological control.

Relational aggression refers to harming others through damaging or manipulating peer relationships.
In a cohort of students surveyed annually from middle to high school, this study identified groups of adolescents who followed distinct trajectories of perpetration and of victimization of relational aggression, compared the proportion of boys and girls in each trajectory, and examined the overlap between perpetration and victimization trajectories.
The sample consisted of 620 randomly selected sixth graders.
Students completed yearly surveys from Grade 6-12.
We used group-based trajectory modeling to identify the trajectories.
Adolescents followed three developmental trajectories of perpetration and three similar trajectories of victimization: Low (lowest aggression), Moderate, and High Declining (high in middle school, with a steep decline in high school).
All trajectories declined from Grade 6-12.
The largest groups were the Low perpetration (55%) and Low victimization (48%).
Relational aggression trajectories differed by gender: more boys reported perpetration, and more girls reported victimization.
For perpetration, slightly more boys than girls were classified in the two trajectories of higher aggression.
For victimization, significantly fewer girls than boys were classified in the Low trajectory, and significantly more girls than boys were classified in the Moderate trajectory.
There was substantial overlap of the perpetration and victimization trajectories.
These findings highlight the importance of implementing programs to reduce relational aggression for boys and for girls.

The current study examined relational aggression as a potential mechanism that explains the association between off-time pubertal development and internalizing problems in youth.
Youth gender was also examined as a moderator for the association between these variables.
It was hypothesized that early pubertal maturation would be associated with higher levels of relationally aggressive behavior which, in turn, would be associated with elevated levels of internalizing problems.
Parents of 372 children between the ages of 8 and 17 were recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk.
Parents responded to demographic information about themselves, as well as information about their child's pubertal timing, relationally aggressive behavior, and anxiety and depressive symptoms.
Findings indicated that early pubertal timing was associated with higher levels of anxiety directly, and higher levels of both anxiety and depressive symptoms indirectly through higher levels of relational aggression.
In all but one of the pathways examined, gender was not found to moderate the associations between the study variables of interest.
This study is the first to examine relational aggression as a mechanism by which early pubertal timing leads to internalizing problems.
The findings suggest that relational aggression could be a target for intervention among early developing youth who are at risk for internalizing problems.

A number of studies suggest that adolescents who view relational aggression on television are more likely to engage in higher levels of subsequent relational aggression in social interactions.
This study examined longitudinal associations between viewing relational aggression on television and relationally aggressive behavior in text messaging over a 1-year period during adolescence.
Participants were 197 adolescents who completed a number of questionnaires regarding media use and aggression.
Adolescents were each given a BlackBerry device and a sample of text messages was coded for aggressive behavior.
Results revealed that exposure to relational aggression on television was associated with higher levels of relational aggression in texting one year later, but only for girls.
Results are discussed with reference to the General Aggression Model.

This research examined developmental trajectories for social and physical aggression for a sample followed from age 9 to 18, and investigated possible family predictors of following different trajectory groups.
Participants were 158 girls and 138 boys, their teachers, and their parents (21% African American, 5.3% Asian, 51.6% Caucasian, and 21% Hispanic).
Teachers rated children's social and physical aggression yearly in grades 3-12.
Participants' parent (83% mothers) reported on family income, conflict strategies, and maternal authoritarian and permissive parenting styles.
The results suggested that both social and physical aggression decline slightly from middle childhood through late adolescence.
Using a dual trajectory model, group-based mixture modeling revealed three trajectory groups for both social and physical aggression: low-, medium-, and high-desisting for social aggression, and stably-low, stably-medium, and high-desisting for physical aggression.
Membership in higher trajectory groups was predicted by being from a single-parent family, and having a parent high on permissiveness.
Being male was related to both elevated physical aggression trajectories and the medium-desisting social aggression trajectory.
Negative interparental conflict strategies did not predict social or physical aggression trajectories when permissive parenting was included in the model.
Permissive parenting in middle childhood predicted following higher social aggression trajectories across many years, which suggests that parents setting fewer limits on children's behaviors may have lasting consequences for their peer relations.
Future research should examine transactional relations between parenting styles and practices and aggression to understand the mechanisms that may contribute to changes in involvement in social and physical aggression across childhood and adolescence.

An experiment was conducted with 150 children (mean age=10.1years) in third to fifth grades to test whether exposure to different forms of aggression in the media affected hostile attributional biases in response to different forms of provocation scenarios.
Children were randomly assigned to watch a clip containing physical aggression, relational aggression, or no aggression.
After exposure, children were asked to respond to a series of written provocation scenarios where a character caused some form of harm (instrumental or relational) to a target person, but the intent of the provocateur was ambiguous.
Results revealed that exposure to relationally aggressive portrayals resulted in a hostile attributional bias in response to relational scenarios, whereas exposure to portrayals of physical aggression was associated with a hostile attributional bias in response to instrumental scenarios.
Moreover, these biases were shown to be specific to the exposure condition (physical or relational) and not simply associated with exposure to aggression in general.
The findings are discussed in terms of the general aggression model and children's social information processing.

The psychometric properties of a recently introduced adult self-report of relational aggression are presented.
Specifically, the predictive utility of proactive and reactive peer-directed relational aggression, as well as romantic relational aggression, are explored in a large (N=1387) study of adults.
The measure had adequate reliability and validity and the subscales demonstrated unique predictive abilities for a number of dependent variables.
In particular, reactive but not proactive relational aggression was uniquely associated with history of abuse, hostile attribution biases, and feelings of distress regarding relational provocation situations.
Reactive relational aggression was also more strongly related to anger and hostility than proactive aggression.
In addition, relational aggression in the context of romantic relationships was uniquely related to anger, hostility, impulsivity, history of abuse, hostile attribution biases, and emotional sensitivity to relational provocations, even when controlling for peer-directed relational aggression.
Gender differences in overall levels of relational aggression were not observed; however, males were most likely to engage in peer-directed proactive and reactive relational aggression whereas females were most likely to engage in romantic relational aggression.
In a second study (N=150), relational aggression was higher in a sample of adults with Intermittent Explosive Disorder than in a sample of healthy controls or psychiatric controls.
The findings highlight the importance of assessing subtypes of relational aggression in adult samples.
Ways in which this measure may extend research in psychology and psychiatry are discussed.

Intimate partner violence and insecure attachment are therapeutically relevant concepts when working with couples.
The link between attachment and intimate partner violence has been examined in the literature, but an area of aggression that often goes unexamined is relational aggression, or using third parties as a means of being aggressive toward a partner.
We asked how participants' attachment behaviors were related to their own and partners' relational and physical aggression.
We used structural equation modeling to estimate actor-partner interdependence among these relationships in 644 heterosexual couples.
Results indicated significant partner paths from attachment to relational aggression, as well as significant actor paths between relational aggression and physical aggression.
Implications were discussed.
Data for this study were collected from the RELATE assessment.

Although there is considerable evidence that relational victimization is associated with depressive symptoms in youth, our understanding about the mechanisms by which victimization and depressive symptoms are linked is limited.
The current study explored ruminating about victimization experiences as a potential mechanism that might contribute to an understanding of the association between relational victimization and depressive symptoms.
We also tested the specificity of the proposed models by controlling for and testing parallel models of a highly related behavior: relational aggression.
A sample of 499 adolescents from sixth through eighth grades participated.
Teacher reports were used to assess relational victimization and relational aggression.
Self-reports were used to assess depressive symptoms and rumination.
The results showed that rumination partially mediated the association between relational victimization and depressive symptoms.
No moderation effect was found.
In contrast, rumination moderated the association between relational aggression and depressive symptoms.
Specifically, relational aggression was associated with depressive symptoms for those adolescents who were also ruminators.
Thus, ruminating about victimization experiences appears to be an important mechanism that functions differently for relational aggression and relational victimization in conferring risk for depressive symptoms.
The findings offer important practical implications for those working with adolescents and also lay the groundwork for future research.

The goal was to assess the association between felt similarity to each gender (an aspect of gender identity) and girls' and boys' differential use of relational versus physical aggression.
We extend past research on gender differences in the use of aggression by expanding the gender dichotomy and allowing for more variations in an individual's gender identity.
Students (N = 414, 47 % female, 6th grade) reported how similar they felt to both their own- and other-gender peers, from which cluster analyses derived four typologies of perceived gender similarity (those who feel similar to their own-gender group; those who feel similar to the other-gender group; those who feel similar to both gender groups; those who feel similar to neither gender group).
Peers reported which classmates were relationally and physically aggressive.
Analyses compared how girls and boys in each typology of gender similarity differed in their use of relational and physical aggression.
Results indicated that most children were engaged in gender normative aggression more than gender non-normative aggression (with the notable exception of low-gender similar girls).
Findings were discussed in terms of their importance both for examining a broad spectrum of gender similarity and for understanding the use of aggressive behavior among children.

Founded in the social process model, the aim of this study was to identify whether the associations of relational aggression with concurrent and subsequent relational victimization differed depending on early adolescents' personal vulnerabilities and gender.
The vulnerabilities of interest were social-information processing variables that convey greater emotional sensitivity, including rejection sensitivity, fear of negative evaluation, and avoidance of intimacy.
Participants were 358 early adolescents (176 boys, 178 girls) aged 9 to 13 years.
Relational aggression and victimization were assessed via peer nominations, whereas the three indicators of emotional sensitivity were assessed via self-report.
Overall, results revealed greater relational aggression at Time 1 to be associated with greater relational victimization at both Time 1 and Time 2.
However, this finding was qualified by both emotional sensitivity and gender.
When considered separately, girls who were relationally aggressive and emotionally sensitive were at increased risk of victimization at both assessment points.
In contrast, no link was found between relational aggression and victimization for boys, although relational vulnerabilities did have unique associations with boys' relational victimization.
These findings have implications for our understanding of relational aggression and victimization, as well as for the development of interventions aimed at reducing these problems.

The role of physical and relational aggression in adolescents' friendship selection was examined in a longitudinal sample of 274 Chilean students from 5th and 6th grade followed over 1 year.
Longitudinal social network modeling (SIENA) was used to study selection processes for aggression while influence processes were controlled for.
Furthermore, the effects of network characteristics (i.e., reciprocity and transitivity), gender, and social status on friendship selection were examined.
The starting assumption of this study was that selection effects based on aggression might have been overestimated in previous research as a result of failing to consider influence processes and alternative characteristics that steer friendship formation.
The results show that selection effects of both physical and relational aggression disappeared when network effects, gender, and social status were taken into account.
Particularly gender and perceived popularity appeared to be far more important determinants of friendship selection over time than aggression.
Moreover, a peer influence effect was only found for relational aggression, and not for physical aggression.
These findings suggest that similarity in aggression among befriended adolescents can be considered to be mainly a by-product rather than a leading dimension in friendship selection.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between relational aggression and sexual satisfaction, as well as to determine if attachment behaviors could mediate this relationship.
Data came from the Relate Institute Questionnaire (RELATE) and were drawn from the matched-pair responses of 539 heterosexual married couples.
Results showed the greater the perceived relational aggression, the lower the sexual satisfaction for both self and partner, regardless of gender.
Mediation analyses suggest that attachment behaviors may be a mechanism through which relational aggression influences sexual satisfaction.
Implications for clinicians and future research are discussed.

Gender differences in play behavior and physical aggression have been consistently reported.
Theoretical perspectives concerning evolutionary, social, and social-cognitive mechanisms suggest that male-typical play behavior during childhood increases subsequent physical aggression.
The evidence supporting these connections is limited, however.
The present study investigated the association between gender-typed play behavior in early childhood and physical aggression in early adolescence using a sample drawn from a longitudinal, population study, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.
Based on gender-typed play behavior as measured by the Pre-School Activities Inventory at age 3.5 years, samples of masculine (64 boys, 60 girls), feminine (80 boys, 66 girls), and randomly selected control children (55 boys, 67 girls) were recruited at age 13 years and administered the Reinisch Aggression Inventory.
After controlling for a range of sociodemographic variables, maternal characteristics, and behavioral problems, including hyperactivity and conduct problems at age 3.5, significant group differences in physical aggression at age 13 were found among children classified as masculine, control, and feminine at age 3.5.
Masculine children exhibited significantly more physical aggression than control children or feminine children, and control children exhibited significantly more physical aggression than feminine children.
The association between gender-typed play behavior and physical aggression was not moderated by sex.
These results suggest that the degree of childhood gender-typed play behavior independently predicts the degree of physical aggression at adolescence in boys and in girls.

Child and adolescent physical aggression are influenced by multiple contexts, such as peers, family, school, and neighborhood.
However, the effect of neighborhoods on youth physical aggression remains unclear.
The objective of this study was to quantitatively synthesize studies that have examined the effect of neighborhood disadvantage on physical aggression in children and adolescents and to identify potential moderators.
We searched seven databases for articles published before April 25, 2015.
Studies were considered eligible if they were published in peer-reviewed journals, used multilevel data, controlled for neighborhood clustering, used physical aggression as the study outcome, and considered children or adolescents as the study population.
Of the 152 eligible studies, we included 43 in the meta-analysis.
The results from the random-effects model revealed that neighborhood disadvantage was positively and significantly associated with physical aggression (P < .001).
Metaregression and moderator analyses further indicated a stronger association between neighborhood disadvantage and physical aggression among studies with younger participants, a higher percentage of female participants, and a longer follow-up period (P < .05).
Current findings, however, may not be generalized to other types of aggression.
The observed neighborhood effects may also be limited because of the omission of studies that did not provide sufficient information for calculating the pooled effect.
In summary, the results provide supporting evidence for the adverse effect of living in disadvantaged neighborhoods on physical aggression after adjusting for the individual-level characteristics of children and adolescents.
Interventions targeting structural contexts in neighborhoods are required to assist in reducing physical aggression in young people.

Many Israelis are preoccupied with the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran, frequently associating it with the danger of annihilation that existed during the Holocaust.
The current article examined whether offspring of Holocaust survivors (OHS) are especially preoccupied and sensitive to the Iranian threat, and whether this susceptibility is a part of their increased general image of actual and potential threats, defined as the hostile world scenario (HWS).
Study 1 (N = 106) showed that relative to comparisons, OHS reported more preoccupation with the Iranian nuclear threat.
Moreover, the positive relationship between the salience of the Iranian threat and symptoms of anxiety was stronger among OHS.
Study 2 (N = 450) replicated these findings, while focusing on the Iranian nuclear threat salience and symptoms of psychological distress.
It further showed that OHS reported more negative engagement with the HWS (i.e., feeling that surrounding threats decrease one's sense of competence), which in turn mediated their increased preoccupation with the Iranian threat.
The results suggest that intergenerational transmission of the Holocaust trauma includes heightened preoccupation with and sensitivity to potential threats of annihilation, and that the specific preoccupation with threats of annihilation reflects a part of a more general preoccupation with surrounding threats.

BACKGROUND: Though a key symptom underlying many anxiety disorders is hypervigilant threat monitoring, its biological bases in humans remain poorly understood.
Animal models suggest that anxious processes such as hypervigilant threat monitoring are distinct from cued fear-like responses and mediated by the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST).
Here, we applied psychophysiological and neuroimaging methodologies sensitive to sustained arousal-based responses to test the role of the human BNST in mediating environmental threat monitoring, a potential experimental model for sustained anxiety symptoms.
METHODS: Healthy participants (n = 50) with varying trait anxiety performed an environmental threat-monitoring task during functional magnetic resonance imaging where a stimulus line continuously fluctuated in height, providing information relevant to subsequent risk for electric shocks.
Skin conductance was collected in a separate cohort (n = 47) to validate task-evoked modulation of physiological arousal.
RESULTS: A forebrain region consistent with the BNST showed greater overall recruitment and exaggerated tracking of threat proximity in individuals with greater anxiety.
The insular cortex tracked threat proximity across all participants, showed exaggerated threat proximity responding with greater anxiety, and showed enhanced recruitment when threat proximity was ostensibly controllable.
CONCLUSIONS: Activity in the BNST and insula continuously monitored changes in environmental threat level and also subserved hypervigilant threat-monitoring processes in more highly trait anxious individuals.
These findings bridge human and animal research informing the role of the BNST in anxious-related processes.
In addition, these findings suggest that continuous functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigms offer promise in further elucidating the neural circuitries supporting sustained anticipatory features of anxiety.

This study investigated modifications to standing posture in response to elevated postural anxiety evoked by a potential physical threat to stability.
Sixteen young adults, 16 older adults and 16 patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) stood with or without the expectation of a threat to their posture (i.e., external trunk perturbation).
This method allowed for the assessment of the effects of anticipatory anxiety on standing posture associated with an ecologically valid and direct threat to stability.
Our manipulation was successful as all participants, independent of age and disease, reported significant increases in postural anxiety when anticipating a threat to their posture.
The trunk sway modifications observed in response to elevated postural anxiety were dependent on age and disease.
Young adults showed increased trunk sway in both pitch and roll directions while older adults demonstrated decreased trunk sway but only in the roll direction when standing and expecting a threat to posture compared to standing without this threat.
Individuals with PD showed no significant changes in trunk pitch or roll sway when anticipating a threat to posture compared to standing without this threat.
Our findings suggest that the effects of postural anxiety on postural control are dependent on the context associated with the postural threat, and age and disease status.

Challenge and threat states predict future performance; however, no research has examined their immediate effect on motor task performance.
The present study examined the effect of challenge and threat states on golf putting performance and several possible mechanisms.
One hundred twenty-seven participants were assigned to a challenge or threat group and performed six putts during which emotions, gaze, putting kinematics, muscle activity, and performance were recorded.
Challenge and threat states were successively manipulated via task instructions.
The challenge group performed more accurately, reported more favorable emotions, and displayed more effective gaze, putting kinematics, and muscle activity than the threat group.
Multiple putting kinematic variables mediated the relationship between group and performance, suggesting that challenge and threat states impact performance at a predominately kinematic level.

Anxiety can have both detrimental and facilitatory cognitive effects.
This study investigates the neural substrates of a replicated facilitatory effect of anxiety on sustained attention and response inhibition.
This effect consisted of improved performance on the Sustained Attention to Response Task (a Go-NoGo task consisting of 91% Go and 9% NoGo trials) in threat (unpredictable electrical shock) vs safe (no shock) conditions.
This study uses the same experimental design with fMRI and relies on an event-related analysis of BOLD signal changes.
Findings reveal that threat-related cognitive facilitation (improved NoGo accuracy) is associated with greater activation of a right-lateralized frontoparietal group of regions previously implicated in sustained attention and response inhibition.
Moreover, these same regions show decreased activation in the Go trials preceding NoGo errors.
During NoGo trials, striatal activity is also greater in the threat vs safe condition, consistent with the notion of enhanced inhibitory processing under threat.
These findings identify potential mechanisms by which threat of unpredictable shock can facilitate distinct cognitive functions.
A greater understanding of the complex interaction of the anxious state and cognitive processes may have critical clinical implications.

Negative emotions such as anxiety enhance pain perception.
However, certain threat characteristics are discussed to have different or even divergent effects on pain (hypoalgesia vs hyperalgesia).
In order to investigate the neurobiological basis of different threats, we compared the impact of conditioned threat (CT) vs instructed threat (IT) on pain using fMRI.
In two groups, participants underwent either Pavlovian threat conditioning or an instructed threat procedure.
Afterwards, in an identical test phase participants watched the same visual cues from the previous phase indicating potential threat or safety, and received painful thermal stimulation.
In the test phase, pain ratings were increased in both groups under threat.
Group comparisons show elevated responses in amygdala and hippocampus for pain under threat in the CT group, and higher activation of the mid-cingulate gyrus (MCC) in the IT group.
Psychophysiological interaction analyses in CT demonstrated elevated connectivity of the amygdala and the insula for the comparison of pain under threat vs safety.
In IT, the same comparison revealed elevated functional connectivity of the MCC and the insula.
The results suggest a similar pain augmenting effect of CT and IT, which, however, seems to rely on different networks mediating the impact of threat on pain.

Behavioural pattern separation (BPS), the ability to distinguish among similar stimuli based on subtle physical differences, has been used to study the mechanism underlying stimulus generalisation.
Fear overgeneralisation is often observed in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder and other anxiety disorders.
However, the relationship between anxiety and BPS remains unclear.
The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of anxiety (threat of shock) on BPS, which was assessed across separate encoding and retrieval sessions.
Images were encoded/retrieved during blocks of threat or safety in a 2 x 2 factorial design.
During retrieval, participants indicated whether images were new, old, or altered.
Better accuracy was observed for altered images encoded during periods of threat compared to safety, but only if those images were also retrieved during periods of safety.
These results suggest that overgeneralisation in anxiety may be due to altered pattern separation.

The dot-probe task is often considered a gold standard in the field for investigating attentional bias to threat.
However, serious issues with the task have been raised.
Specifically, a number of studies have demonstrated that the traditional reaction time (RT) measure of attentional bias to threat in the dot-probe task has poor internal reliability and poor test-retest reliability.
In addition, although threatening stimuli capture attention in other paradigms, attentional bias to threat has not usually been found in typical research participants in the dot-probe task.
However, when attention is measured in the dot-probe task with the N2pc component of the event-related potential waveform, substantial attentional orienting to threat is observed, and the internal reliability is moderate.
To provide a rigorous comparison of the reliability of this N2pc measure and the conventional behavioral measure, as well as to examine the relationship of these measures to anxiety, the present study examined the N2pc in conjunction with RT in the dot-probe task in a large sample of participants (N = 96).
As in previous studies, RT showed no bias to threatening images across the sample and exhibited poor internal reliability.
Moreover, this measure did not relate to trait anxiety.
By contrast, the N2pc revealed a significant initial shift of attention to threat, and this measure was internally reliable.
However, the N2pc was not correlated with trait anxiety, indicating that it does not provide a meaningful index of individual differences in anxiety in the dot-probe task.
Together, these results indicate a serious need to develop new tasks and methods to more reliably investigate attentional bias to threat and its relationship to anxiety in both clinical and non-clinical populations.

Considerable translational research on anxiety examines attention bias to threat and the efficacy of attention training in reducing symptoms.
Imaging research on the stability of brain functions engaged by attention bias tasks could inform such research.
Perturbed fronto-amygdala function consistently arises in attention bias research on adolescent anxiety.
The current report examines the stability of the activation and functional connectivity of these regions on the dot-probe task.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation and connectivity data were acquired with the dot-probe task in 39 healthy youth (f=18, Mean Age=13.71years, SD=2.31) at two time points, separated by approximately nine weeks.
Intraclass-correlations demonstrate good reliability in both neural activation for the ventrolateral PFC and task-specific connectivity for fronto-amygdala circuitry.
Behavioral measures showed generally poor test-retest reliability.
These findings suggest potential avenues for future brain imaging work by highlighting brain circuitry manifesting stable functioning on the dot-probe attention bias task.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that assessment of threat-related attention bias may be useful in identifying soldiers at risk for clinical symptoms.
The present study assessed the degree to which soldiers experienced combat events and showed attentional threat avoidance affected their reported levels of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety symptoms.
METHODS: Four months after a combat deployment to Iraq, 63 US soldiers completed a survey assessing combat exposures and clinical symptoms as well as a dot-probe task assessing threat-related attention bias.
RESULTS: Significant three-way interactions regressing threat reaction times (RTs), neutral RTs, and combat exposure on PTSD and anxiety symptoms were observed.
Specifically, soldiers with high levels of combat exposure, who were more likely to demonstrate attentional bias away from threat, were also more symptomatic.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the potential of threat-related attention bias as a behavioral marker of PTSD and anxiety symptoms in a high-risk military occupational context.

The present study examined the interaction of anticipatory anxiety and selective emotion processing.
Toward this end, a rapid stream of pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant pictures was presented in alternating blocks of threat-of-shock or safety, which were signaled by colored picture frames.
The main finding is that pleasant pictures elicited a sustained negative difference potential over occipital regions during threat as compared to safety periods.
In contrast, unpleasant and neutral picture processing did not vary as a function of threat-of-shock.
Furthermore, in both the safety and threat-of-shock conditions, emotional pictures elicited an enlarged early posterior negativity and late positive potential.
These data show that the activation of the fear/anxiety network exerts valence-specific effects on affective picture processing.
Pleasant stimuli mismatching the current state of anticipatory anxiety apparently draw more attentional resources.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Current models of SAD assume that attentional processes play a pivotal role in the etiology and maintenance of social anxiety disorder.
Social anxiety is supposedly associated with an attentional bias towards disorder related stimuli such as threatening faces.
Using the facial dot probe task in socially anxious individuals has, however, revealed inconsistent findings.
METHODS: The current systematic review aims at disentangling the heterogeneous findings using effect sizes across results by systematically taking into account potential moderating variables (stimulus type, stimulus duration, situational anxiety, disorder severity).
RESULTS: Results provide some evidence that socially anxious individuals preferentially allocate their attention towards threat faces compared to non-anxious controls.
This bias seems to depend on the type of reference stimulus, stimulus duration and clinical level of social anxiety.
Avoidance of threat was neither found at early, nor at later stages of attentional processing.
LIMITATIONS: Importantly, the results have to be considered in the light of the only few studies available.
Given the heterogeneity of results and some methodological restrictions of the studies included, the picture of attentional bias seems to be much less clear than suggested in the recent social anxiety literature.
CONCLUSIONS: Methodologically, combined measures of dot-probe and eye movement measures might be beneficial to detect overt attentional biases.
Importantly, our results show that preferential processing of threat cues might guide early attentional processes in social anxiety, depending however on several contextual and situational factors.
Clinically, patients with greater severity of SAD may be more prone to such an attentional bias, thus therapists should take this into account when planning behavioral experiments and exposure therapy.

The current study is a review of existing literature on perceived threat across childhood (0-19 years).
There is strong evidence from this body of research that threat detection emerges in infancy and is present throughout childhood, with meaningful links to child adjustment.
The wide range of methodologies employed to assess threat include biological measures (event-related potential and functional magnetic resonance imaging), observational data (gaze duration and response time), and a range of ways of gathering cognitive data (threat appraisal).
Across methodologies, a uniform finding is that children who have higher threat attenuation are at increased risk for the development of anxiety disorders.
It also seems that children's attention to threatening stimuli may vary across development, with heightened attention in infancy and early childhood.
These findings have meaningful extensions for children who are living in violent families.
Since many children living in violent homes are exposed to the threat of violence beginning in infancy, these children may be at heightened risk as compared to their nonexposed peers for the development of maladaptive patterns of threat detection and response.
There is some evidence that this long-standing pattern of vigilance toward threat in key developmental periods may in part explain the increased risk of the development of anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder following exposure to violence.

Information processing models propose that anxious individuals are characterized by memory biases for mood-congruent threat information.
However, evidence for memory biases in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has been mixed at best.
Given the heterogeneity of concerns in GAD, previous use of nomothetic stimulus sets may have precluded detection of memory biases.
Therefore, in order to guarantee the relevance of the stimuli used, in the current study individuals with GAD each individually selected words that were of personal relevance to them.
Using these idiographically selected words with 23 individuals with DSM-IV GAD and 23 non-anxious controls (NACs), results showed an implicit memory bias for threat words in individuals with GAD compared with NACs.
Furthermore, there was additional evidence that individuals with GAD may also be characterized by explicit memory bias for threat words.
The magnitude of group differences for explicit recall of threat words was similar to those previously observed in panic disorder.
Limitations and future directions are discussed.

Anxiety is reliably associated with an attentional bias favoring threatening information which is thought to be a key mechanism in the etiology and maintenance of anxious pathology.
However, whether and how anxiety is related to attentional capture at a more basic level (i.e., in the absence of threat) is less well understood.
To address this gap in the literature, we examined the association between anxiety and attentional capture in the context of visually salient, yet affectively neutral, stimuli.
Specifically, we used a visual search task in which participants were required to locate a target while ignoring a salient distractor stimulus.
A total of 122 undergraduates-half of whom were assigned to a state-anxiety induction-completed this task while event-related potentials were recorded and also completed self-report measures of trait and state anxiety.
The results revealed that trait anxiety, but not state anxiety, was associated with impaired attentional control in the presence of a salient distractor.
That is, behavioral slowing and the N2pc event-related potential-a neural measure of attentional selection-were enhanced for trait-anxious participants when the distractor was proximate to the target and required controlled attention in order to inhibit it.
These findings extend previous work by providing evidence from multiple levels of analysis that attentional aberrations in anxiety reflect broad deficits in inhibiting distracting stimuli and are not limited to threat-relevant contexts.

Disproportionately more smokers report low-income and mental health problems relative to non-smokers.
Low-income smokers may use smoking to alleviate negative emotional states resulting from exposure to multiple stressors.
Yet, little work has been devoted to elucidating mechanisms that may explain the association between negative emotional states and smoking-related processes among low-income smokers.
The present study sought to address this gap by examining anxiety sensitivity, a transdiagnostic factor related to both anxiety and smoking, as a potential mediator for the influence of anxiety symptoms on smoking-related processes, including threat-related smoking abstinence expectancies (somatic symptoms and harmful consequences), perceived barriers for cessation, and problems experienced during past quit attempts.
Participants included treatment-seeking daily cigarette smokers (n=101; 68.3% male; Mage=47.1; SD=10.2).
Results indicated that anxiety symptoms exerted a significant indirect effect through anxiety sensitivity for threat-related smoking abstinence expectancies (somatic symptoms and harmful consequences), perceived barriers for cessation, and problems experienced during past quit attempts.
The present results provide empirical support that anxiety sensitivity may be an underlying mechanism that partially explains the relation between anxiety symptoms and smoking processes among low-income treatment-seeking smokers.
Findings broaden current theoretical understanding of pathways through which anxiety symptoms contribute to maladaptive smoking processes and cognitions among socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers.

Computer-based approaches, such as Attention Bias Modification (ABM), could help improve access to care for anxiety.
Study-level meta-analyses of ABM have produced conflicting findings and leave critical questions unresolved regarding ABM's mechanisms of action and clinical potential.
We pooled patient-level datasets from randomized controlled trials of children and adults with high-anxiety.
Attentional bias (AB) towards threat, the target mechanism of ABM, was tested as an outcome and a mechanistic mediator and moderator of anxiety reduction.
Diagnostic remission and Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) were clinical outcomes available in enough studies to enable pooling.
Per-patient data were obtained on at least one outcome from 13/16 eligible studies [86% of eligible participants; n=778].
Significant main effects of ABM on diagnostic remission (ABM-22.6%, control-10.8%; OR=2.57; p=0.006) and AB (beta* (95%CI)=-0.63 (-0.83, -0.42); p<0.00005) were observed.
There was no main effect of ABM on LSAS.
However, moderator analyses suggested ABM was effective for patients who were younger (</=37y), trained in the lab, and/or assessed by clinicians.
Under the same conditions where ABM was effective, mechanistic links between AB and anxiety reduction were supported.
Under these specific circumstances, ABM reduces anxiety and acts through its target mechanism, supporting ABM's theoretical basis while simultaneously suggesting clinical indications and refinements to improve its currently limited clinical potential.

Patterns of synchrony in repeated measures of heart rate, skin conductance levels, negative affect, and positive affect were investigated in patients with social anxiety disorder and non-anxious controls during a speech task.
Despite expected low levels of absolute concordance between measures of affect and arousal overall, results revealed clearly defined and specific patterns of emotional response coherence that distinguished between the two groups and depended on the types of measures used.
Specifically, findings demonstrated that (a) for both patients and controls, increased heart rate was significantly synchronized with increased negative affect, with patients showing overall stronger levels of synchrony between these two measures than controls; (b) for controls only, increased heart rate was significantly synchronized with increased positive affect; and (c) for patients only, increased skin conductance was significantly synchronized with both increased negative affect and decreased positive affect.
These findings are discussed in relation to current conceptualizations of the construct of emotion as well as directions for future research and potential implications for clinical practice.

Emotional processes have an impact on the anticipation and perception of bodily threat sensations, such as breathlessness.
However, little is known about the reverse influence of breathlessness on emotional processes, as well as its modulation by anxiety sensitivity (AS).
Here, we investigated by means of visually evoked potentials how the perception versus anticipation of resistive-load-induced breathlessness (RLIB) influences emotional processing.
High (HA) and low anxious (LA) participants viewed pictures of positive, neutral, or negative content under conditions of perceived RLIB, anticipated RLIB, or an unloaded baseline.
The P2 (230-290 ms) was significantly less positive under perceived RLIB.
Furthermore, the early late positive potential (LPP; 300-500 ms) was significantly less positive during both RLIB conditions, as compared to baseline.
Overall, the P1 was significantly more positive in HA as compared to LA individuals.
Additionally, across conditions, the late LPP (600-1,000 ms) was enhanced for positive and negative pictures as opposed to neutral ones for the LA group.
In contrast, for the HA group only, the positive pictures elicited the typical enhanced LPP.
Notably, for the HA participants, negative pictures elicited significantly blunted late LPPs during perceived RLIB as compared to anticipated RLIB and baseline.
A reversed effect (i.e., more positivity) was observed for LA participants, suggesting motivational priming.
Taken together, these results highlight the impact of perceived and anticipated respiratory threat on the neural processing of emotional picture stimuli, as well as its modulation by anxiety sensitivity levels.

Overgeneralization of fear to safety cues is increasingly being studied in order to further our understanding of the maintenance of anxiety disorders.
The current study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to evaluate whether worry affects anticipation and processing of threat and neutral pictures during a conditioning task.
Fifty-two high (n=24) and low (n=28) worriers completed a paradigm in which a neutral stimulus indicated the valence of a second stimulus, either a threat or neutral picture.
Results found that worriers displayed reduced anticipatory responses to both stimulus types as indexed by the stimulus preceding negativity, although they displayed an increased stimulus preceding negativity to threatening images during the second half of the task.
In addition, high and low worriers differed in processing of threat and neutral images as indexed by the late positive potential.
These findings support the overgeneralization of fear literature, suggesting that worriers display difficulty discriminating safety cues from threat cues, and this affects the attentional resources devoted to subsequent stimuli.
Implications of these results are discussed.

Threat-related attentional disruptions in anxiety may relate to changes in cognitive control during task processing.
The present study examined this question using the N2 event-related brain potential.
It was predicted that threat stimuli will selectively influence the N2 for those showing elevated trait anxiety and that reduced N2 may reflect a compensatory process predicting better attention performance.
EEG was recorded while 36 participants completed a cued flanker task with threat or nonthreat distracters.
N2 amplitudes were greater to incongruent versus congruent flankers.
Following threat, high trait anxious participants showed reduced modulation of the N2 by flanker type and greater N2 amplitudes to congruent flankers.
Reduced N2 was associated with better attention performance.
This study was among the first documenting the emotional modulation of the N2 related to the threat bias and its links with attention interference in anxiety.

OBJECTIVE: In the treatment of anxiety disorders, attention bias modification therapy (ABMT) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) may have complementary effects by targeting different aspects of perturbed threat responses and behaviors.
ABMT may target rapid, implicit threat reactions, whereas CBT may target slowly deployed threat responses.
The authors used amygdala-based connectivity during a threat-attention task and a randomized controlled trial design to evaluate potential complementary features of these treatments in pediatric anxiety disorders.
METHOD: Prior to treatment, youths (8-17 years old) with anxiety disorders (N=54), as well as healthy comparison youths (N=51), performed a threat-attention task during functional MRI acquisition.
Task-related amygdala-based functional connectivity was assessed.
Patients with and without imaging data (N=85) were then randomly assigned to receive CBT paired with either active or placebo ABMT.
Clinical response was evaluated, and pretreatment amygdala-based connectivity profiles were compared among patients with varying levels of clinical response.
RESULTS: Compared with the CBT plus placebo ABMT group, the CBT plus active ABMT group exhibited less severe anxiety after treatment.
The patient and healthy comparison groups differed in amygdala-insula connectivity during the threat-attention task.
Patients whose connectivity profiles were most different from those of the healthy comparison group exhibited the poorest response to treatment, particularly those who received CBT plus placebo ABMT.
CONCLUSIONS: The study provides evidence of enhanced clinical effects for patients receiving active ABMT.
Moreover, ABMT appears to be most effective for patients with abnormal amygdala-insula connectivity.
ABMT may target specific threat processes associated with dysfunctional amygdala-insula connectivity that are not targeted by CBT alone.
This may explain the observation of enhanced clinical response to CBT plus active ABMT.

Aberrant threat perception has been linked to paranoia, anxiety and other mental health problems, and is widely considered to be a core, transdiagnostic feature of psychopathology.
However, to date there has been only limited investigation of whether mental health problems are associated with a biased interpretation of stimuli that have explicit (as opposed to ambiguous) connotations of threat.
In the present study, 41 adolescents diagnosed with a mental illness and 45 demographically matched controls were asked to provide danger ratings of stimuli normatively rated as being either low or high in potential threat.
All participants were also asked to complete background measures of cognitive function, mental health and wellbeing.
The results indicated that the two groups did not differ in their capacity to discriminate between low and high threat stimuli, nor did they differ in the absolute level of threat that they attributed to these stimuli.
However, for the control group, the overall level of threat perceived in facial stimuli was correlated with two important indices of mental health (depression and anxiety).
No associations emerged in the clinical group.
These data are discussed in relation to their potential implications for the role of aberrant threat perception in transdiagnostic models of mental health.

Social anxiety is the intense fear of negative evaluation by others, and it emerges uniquely from a social situation.
Given its social origin, we asked whether an anxiety-inducing social situation could enhance the processing of faces linked to the situational threat.
While past research has focused on how individual differences in social anxiety relate to face processing, we tested the effect of manipulated social anxiety in the context of anxiety about appearing racially prejudiced in front of a peer.
Visual processing of faces was indexed by the N170 component of the event-related potential.
Participants viewed faces of Black and White males, along with nonfaces, either in private or while being monitored by the experimenter for signs of prejudice in a 'public' condition.
Results revealed a difference in the N170 response to Black and Whites faces that emerged only in the public condition and only among participants high in dispositional social anxiety.
These results provide new evidence that anxiety arising from the social situation modulates the earliest stages of face processing in a way that is specific to a social threat, and they shed new light on how anxiety effects on perception may contribute to the regulation of intergroup responses.

Anxiety disorders are associated with enhanced defensive reactivity to errors, measured via the error-related negativity (ERN).
There is some evidence to suggest that problematic alcohol use is also associated with an enhanced ERN; although prior studies have been almost exclusively in men and have yet to examine the potential interactive effects of anxiety and alcohol abuse symptoms.
The aim of the current study was to address the gaps in this literature by examining the unique and interactive effects of anxiety symptoms and problematic alcohol use on the ERN in a sample of 79 heterogeneous internalizing disorder patients.
All participants completed a flanker task designed to robustly elicit the ERN and questionnaires assessing current internalizing symptoms and problematic alcohol use.
As expected, results revealed that greater anxiety symptoms, but not depressive symptoms, were associated with a more enhanced ERN.
There was no main effect of problematic alcohol use but there was a significant anxiety by problematic alcohol use interaction.
At high anxiety symptoms, greater problematic alcohol use was associated with a more enhanced ERN; at low anxiety symptoms, alcohol use was unrelated to the ERN.
There was no depression by alcohol abuse interaction.
The findings suggest that within anxious individuals, heightened reactivity to errors/threat may be related to risk for alcohol abuse.
The findings also converge with a broader literature suggesting that heightened reactivity to threat may be a shared vulnerability factor for anxiety and alcohol abuse and a novel prevention and intervention target for anxiety-alcohol abuse comorbidity.

BACKGROUND: Neural activity is increasingly used in addition to behavioral measures to study anxiety and attentional biases toward threatening stimuli.
Event-related potentials (ERPs) might be particularly useful because of their excellent temporal resolution.
In particular, the late positive potential (LPP) reflects increased attention to emotional stimuli-and was recently found to be larger with increasing state anxiety.
This study sought to examine the LPP among individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).
METHODS: Fifteen individuals with GAD and 15 healthy controls (HCs) viewed briefly presented pairs of aversive and neutral pictures that were presented to the left and right of, as well as above and below, fixation on each trial; ERP and behavioral measures were recorded as participants indicated whether the horizontal or vertical image pairs were the same or different.
RESULTS: Aversive pictures presented in unattended locations were associated with more errors overall, and this effect was larger in GAD than HC participants.
Moreover, aversive targets elicited larger LPPs across all participants; this difference was larger in GAD than HC participants when distracters were neutral.
CONCLUSIONS: Threatening stimuli presented in both target and distracting spatial locations have a greater impact on GAD than HC participants.
Behavioral and ERP measures provide complimentary indices of attention toward threat in GAD.
In terms of attentional control theory, behavioral interference indexes impaired processing effectiveness, whereas the LPP might index reduced processing efficiency in GAD.
Both measures may provide unique windows onto how increased stimulus-driven attention to threat impacts and characterizes GAD.

Worry is characterized by streams of verbal thoughts about potential negative outcomes.
Individuals with high levels of worry (and particularly those with generalized anxiety disorder) find it very difficult to control worry once it has started.
What is not clear is the extent to which verbal negative thinking style maintains worry.
Our study aimed to disentangle the effects of verbal versus imagery based thinking, and negative versus positive worry-related content on subsequent negative intrusive thoughts.
High worriers were trained to engage in imagery or verbal processing, focusing on either negative or positive outcomes of their current main worry.
Both thinking style and valence of worry content influenced later negative intrusive thoughts that play a role in initiating worry episodes.
In contrast, only valence influenced subjective ratings of worry outcomes (i.e., cost, concern, and ability to cope, although not probability), with positive valence leading to lower ratings, irrespective of thinking style.

Examined the relation between childhood anxiety and threat-perception abnormalities using vignettes in which external (i.e., exposure to potential threat cues) and internal (i.e., experience of anxiety responses) information were systematically varied.
Nonclinical children (N = 156) aged 8 to 13 years completed anxiety questionnaires and were then exposed to 3 types of stories: ambiguous stories, ambiguous + anxiety-response stories, and nonthreatening stories.
From children's responses to these stories, a number of threat-perception indexes were derived.
Results showed that both external and internal information inflated children's perception of threat.
Further, high levels of anxiety were accompanied by enhanced threat perception in response to external threat cues.
Finally, little evidence was found that high levels of anxiety, and in particular of anxiety sensitivity, were associated with a greater tendency to use internal information (i.e., emotional reasoning).
Potential avenues for future studies on anxiety-related threat-perception distortions are briefly discussed.

Anxiety is an adaptive human experience that may occur at all ages and serves to help draw attention to, avoid or cope with immanent threat and danger.
Given its evolutionary importance, it has strong genetic and biological underpinnings, and when it serves that adaptive function for the organism, anxiety may be viewed as useful.
However, complex adaptive systems, such as our adaptation to threat or stress, by definition provide many and often interrelated points of breakdown or dysregulation, which, if sustained, may lead to psychopathology.
Anxiety has been described as a common currency for psychopathology, indicating that it is a first line and universal way for us to respond to stress and threat.
It is more or less prominent in patients diagnosed with practically all psychiatric or neurodegenerative disorders.
This has lead to the inclusion of anxiety as a cross-cutting symptom measure in the development of DSM-5 (APA, 2013).
Given that they are rooted in a complex adaptive system that has many potential points of impact to develop pathology, it is not surprising that anxiety disorders are extremely heterogeneous.
This heterogeneity of anxiety disorders pertains to symptomatology, etiology and outcomes, and poses great challenges to both research and clinical practice.

Predictability is an important characteristic of threat that impacts defensive motivation and attentional engagement.
Supporting research has primarily focused on actual threat (e.g., shocks), and it is unclear whether the predictability of less intense threat (e.g., unpleasant pictures) similarly affects motivation and attention.
The present study utilized a within-subject design and examined defensive motivation (startle reflex and self-reported anxiety) and attention (probe N100 and P300) in anticipation of shocks and unpleasant pictures during a no, predictable, and unpredictable threat task.
This study also examined the impact of predictability on the P300 to shocks and late positive potential (LPP) to unpleasant pictures.
The startle reflex and self-reported anxiety were increased in anticipation of both types of threat relative to no threat.
Furthermore, startle potentiation in anticipation of unpredictable threat was greater for shocks compared to unpleasant pictures, but there was no difference for predictable threat.
The probe N100 was enhanced in anticipation of unpredictable threat relative to predictable threat and no threat, and the probe P300 was suppressed in anticipation of predictable and unpredictable threat relative to no threat.
These effects did not differ between the shock and unpleasant picture trials.
Finally, the P300 and early LPP component were increased in response to unpredictable relative to predictable shocks and unpleasant pictures, respectively.
The present study suggests that the unpredictability of unpleasant pictures increases defensive motivation, but to a lesser degree relative to actual threat.
Moreover, unpredictability enhances attentional engagement in anticipation of, and in reaction to, both types of threat.

OBJECTIVES: Although ambiguous and uncertain situations, such as those dealing with the threat of widespread viral illness, may have pronounced psychological ramifications, there have been few studies that examined the factors that contributed to such outcomes.
The purpose of the present investigation was to examine emotional reactions to a health threat.
DESIGN: A structural equation model examined the interplay between anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty, as sequentially mediated by appraisals and coping strategies.
METHODS: Adult participants over the age of 18 (N = 1,027) completed online self-report measures during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009.
RESULTS: Greater intolerance of uncertainty was related to lower appraisals of self- and other control, which predicted low levels of problem-focused coping and greater reports of H1N1-related anxiety.
Additionally, individuals with a high intolerance of uncertainty were more likely to perceive the pandemic as threatening and also were more apt to use emotion-focused coping strategies, and both of these factors predicted elevated levels of anxiety.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data indicate that threats, such as those related to a potential pandemic, not only have implications for physical health, but also for psychological distress, and that such outcomes vary with a constellation of appraisal and coping factors.
STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: What is already known on this subject?
It has been established that the public is often confused by the threat that a potential pandemic virus poses and that they are unsure of what information related to the disease they can trust.
Government health agencies often walk the line of minimizing the threat to prevent panic, but simultaneously emphasize the importance of action (vaccination) to prevent a worldwide pandemic.
What does this study add?
Beyond the physical threat of a pandemic, a significant psychological toll may occur for certain individuals.
Anxiety regarding H1N1 is heightened amongst those who cannot tolerate uncertainty.
Appraisals of threat, control, and the use of emotion-focused coping mediate the above relationship.

BACKGROUND: Rodent approach-avoidance conflict tests are common preclinical models of human anxiety disorder.
Their translational validity mainly rests on the observation that anxiolytic drugs reduce rodent anxiety-like behavior.
Here, we capitalized on a recently developed approach-avoidance conflict computer game to investigate the impact of benzodiazepines and of amygdala lesions on putative human anxiety-like behavior.
In successive epochs of this game, participants collect monetary tokens on a spatial grid while under threat of virtual predation.
METHODS: In a preregistered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we tested the effect of a single dose (1 mg) of lorazepam (n = 59).
We then compared 2 patients with bilateral amygdala lesions due to Urbach-Wiethe syndrome with age- and gender-matched control participants (n = 17).
Based on a previous report, the primary outcome measure was the effect of intra-epoch time (i.e., an adaptation to increasing potential loss) on presence in the safe quadrant of the spatial grid.
We hypothesized reduced loss adaptation in this measure under lorazepam and in patients with amygdala lesions.
RESULTS: Lorazepam and amygdala lesions reduced loss adaptation in the primary outcome measure.
We found similar results in several secondary outcome measures.
The relative reduction of anxiety-like behavior in patients with amygdala lesions was qualitatively and quantitatively indistinguishable from an impact of anterior hippocampus lesions found in a previous report.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results establish the translational validity of human approach-avoidance conflict tests in terms of anxiolytic drug action.
We identified the amygdala, in addition to the hippocampus, as a critical structure in human anxiety-like behavior.

Study of the anxiety disorders may be a particularly useful vehicle for demonstrating how foundational sciences (e.g cognitive-affective neuroscience, evolutionary psychology) can advance psychiatric theory and research.
Here we consider important potential advances and remaining future challenges when basic research on threat detection and precautionary responses is used to address the anxiety disorders.
We emphasize the potential value of a model of threat detection and precautionary responses that integrates cognitive-affective neuroscience and evolutionary approaches for understanding the anxiety disorders.
However, we also suggest that substantial additional work is needed in order to link systematically the psychobiological mechanisms posited by basic work on threat detection and precautionary responses to the complex phenomena seen in the clinic.

Increased levels of peripheral inflammatory markers, including C-Reactive Protein (CRP), are associated with increased risk for depression, anxiety, and suicidality.
The brain mechanisms that may underlie the association between peripheral inflammation and internalizing problems remain to be determined.
The present study examines associations between peripheral CRP concentrations and threat-related amygdala activity, a neural biomarker of depression and anxiety risk, in a sample of 172 young adult undergraduate students.
Participants underwent functional MRI scanning while performing an emotional face matching task to obtain a measure of threat-related amygdala activity to angry and fearful faces; CRP concentrations were assayed from dried blood spots.
Results indicated a significant interaction between CRP and sex: in men, but not women, higher CRP was associated with higher threat-related amygdala activity.
These results add to the literature finding associations between systemic levels of inflammation and brain function and suggest that threat-related amygdala activity may serve as a potential pathway through which heightened chronic inflammation may increase risk for mood and anxiety problems.

The present study was performed to examine the sedative effects of second-generation histamine H(1) receptor antagonist using power spectrum analysis in the rat.
Similar to ketotifen, olopatadine caused a decrease in sleep latency at a dose of 50 mg/kg, while epinastine and cetirizine showed no significant effect even at a dose of 50 mg/kg.
On the other hand, no significant difference was observed in the total times of wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement sleep and rapid eye movement sleep by any drugs used in the experiments.
The number of sleep phases and interval between sleep phases were also unchanged by these drugs.
Ketotifen and olopatadine inhibited [(3)H]mepyramine binding to rat brain homogenates in parallel with a decrease in sleep latency.
No significant effect was observed with epinastine and cetirizine on [(3)H]mepyramine binding.
These findings suggest that the differences in the central nervous system (CNS) depressant effect observed in second generation H(1) receptor antagonists may be due to their liability to penetrate into the CNS.

A 24 hour variation of core body temperature in humans is primarily regulated by the endogenous circadian pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus.
And the expression of circadian rhythm is modified by the thermoregulatory mechanism controlling heat production and heat loss, which also show circadian rhythms.
On the other hand, circadian rhythms in sleep-wakefulness are expressed by two independent but mutually coupled oscillators, the circadian pacemaker and the oscillator specific to sleep-wakefulness.
However, neither the mechanism nor the site of oscillation of the latter is known.
The time cues for these two oscillators are different.
They are usually but frequently uncoupled under free-running conditions.
Body temperature and sleep-wakefulness influence the counterpart in various extents, exerting masking effects on either circadian rhythm.

Acute stress is known to modify sleep-wakefulness cycle, although with considerable interindividual differences.
The origin of these individual differences remains unknown.
One possibility is an involvement of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), as its reactivity is correlated with an individual's behavioral reactivity to stress, and it is known to influence the sleep-wakefulness cycle.
The present study was designed to analyze relationships between natural differences in behavioral reactivity to stress associated with differential HPA reactivity and stress-induced changes in sleep-wakefulness.
Adult rats were classified into two sub-groups according to their locomotor reactivity to a mild stress (novel environment): the 'low responders (LR)' and the 'high responders (HR)' animals exhibited different glucocorticoid secretion in response to stress.
We show that immobilization stress induced an increase in wakefulness in LR animals and a decrease in wakefulness in HR animals.
On the other hand, paradoxical sleep was increased in both LR and HR animals.
Moreover, we observed that LR animals slept more than the HR animals, whereas the two groups had similar levels of paradoxical sleep.
These results indicate that the response of the sleep-wakefulness cycle to stress is related to the behavioral reactivity to stress, in turn governed by the individual's reactivity of the HPA axis.
The involvement of dopaminergic mechanisms is discussed.

Hypothalamic neurons expressing neuropeptide orexins are critically involved in the control of sleep and wakefulness.
Although the activity of orexin neurons is thought to be influenced by various neuronal input as well as humoral factors, the direct consequences of changes in the activity of these neurons in an intact animal are largely unknown.
We therefore examined the effects of orexin neuron-specific pharmacogenetic modulation in vivo by a new method called the Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs approach (DREADD).
Using this system, we successfully activated and suppressed orexin neurons as measured by Fos staining.
EEG and EMG recordings suggested that excitation of orexin neurons significantly increased the amount of time spent in wakefulness and decreased both non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep times.
Inhibition of orexin neurons decreased wakefulness time and increased NREM sleep time.
These findings clearly show that changes in the activity of orexin neurons can alter the behavioral state of animals and also validate this novel approach for manipulating neuronal activity in awake, freely-moving animals.

The medial preoptico-anterior hypothalamic area receives adrenergic as well as cholinergic inputs.
Independent studies showed that both these inputs influence sleep, wakefulness and body temperature.
The role of the adrenergic inputs was studied earlier.
The role of cholinergic inputs is reported here.
The cholinergic agonist, carbachol, and antagonist, scopolamine, were injected into this area during the day and the night in freely moving rats and the effects on sleep-wakefulness and body temperature studied.
It was observed that carbachol induced wakefulness accompanied by a fall in body temperature while scopolamine induced an opposite effect, i.e., sleep accompanied by an increase in body temperature.
This suggested that the cholinergic input into the medial preoptic area is spontaneously active in regulating sleep-wakefulness and body temperature and this regulation is mediated through muscarinic receptors present in this area.
The results also suggest that, contrary to the action of adrenergic inputs (which have a dissociated effect on sleep-wakefulness and body temperature), the cholinergic input is unlikely to have a dissociated effect on those functions.

Although, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus acts as the central clock in mammals, the circadian expression of clock genes has been demonstrated not only in the SCN, but also in peripheral tissues and brain regions outside the SCN.
However, the physiological roles of extra-SCN circadian clocks in the brain remain largely elusive.
In response, we generated Nkx2.1-Bmal1(-/-) mice in which Bmal1, an essential clock component, was genetically deleted specifically in the ventral forebrain, including the preoptic area, nucleus of the diagonal band, and most of the hypothalamus except the SCN.
In these mice, as expected, PER2::LUC oscillation was drastically attenuated in the explants of mediobasal hypothalamus, whereas it was maintained in those of the SCN.
Although, Nkx2.1-Bmal1(-/-) mice were rhythmic and nocturnal, they showed altered patterns of locomotor activity during the night in a 12:12-h light:dark cycle and during subjective night in constant darkness.
Control mice were more active during the first half than the second half of the dark phase or subjective night, whereas Nkx2.1-Bmal1(-/-) mice showed the opposite pattern of locomotor activity.
Temporal patterns of sleep-wakefulness and feeding also changed accordingly.
Such results suggest that along with mechanisms in the SCN, local Bmal1-dependent clocks in the ventral forebrain are critical for generating precise temporal patterns of circadian behaviors.

Hypocretins (also called orexins) are two newly discovered neuropeptides originating from the same precursor, preprohypocretin.
The amino-acid sequences of hypocretin are highly conserved among vertebrates.
Cells bodies of hypocretin neurons are restricted mainly to the lateral and ventral hypothalamus, while hypocretin fibers project throughout the brain, including several areas implicated in the regulation of the sleep/wakefulness cycle.
Hypocretins act on their targets via two specific, membrane-bound, G-protein-coupled receptors, Hcrtr-1 and Hcrtr-2.
Among the various physiological actions ascribed to hypocretins, the strongest evidence are for their involvement in the integration and stabilization of arousal networks.
Degeneration of hypocretin neurons or genetic mutations that prevent the normal synthesis of hypocretins, or their receptors, cause human and animal narcolepsy, a neurological disorder of excessive sleepiness and abnormalities in REM sleep.
Recent data point to an autoimmune origin for human narcolepsy.
It is believed that understanding the role of hypocretins in the pathology of narcolepsy will create the basis for the development of new strategies to effectively treat this disease.

It is estimated that 15 to 25% of the U.S. labor force works night, evening, or rotating shifts.
These non-traditional schedules can affect the circadian rhythm, a self-sustained rhythm of biological processes that plays an important role in modulating sleep/wake function, resulting in circadian rhythm sleep disorder, shift work type, usually referred to as shift work disorder.
The disorder consists of a constant or recurrent pattern of sleep interruption that results in insomnia when sleep is needed and excessive sleepiness during waking hours.
Clinicians need more information about the role of the circadian rhythm in human functioning as well as the pathophysiology, prevalence, and consequences of shift work disorder, so that they can recognize and diagnose this problem in clinical practice.

As the most important site for sleep-wakefulness change, the role of the hypothalamus is particularly emphasized based on our long term experimental data.
After rostral midbrain transection, ECoG of the isolated forebrain recovered sleep-wakefulness change, with circadian rhythm, one week after transection.
In this preparation, after additional bilateral preoptic or posterior hypothalamic lesions, ECoG "insomnia" or "coma" pattern appeared, respectively.
Therefore, the mechanism of sleep-wakefulness change of the forebrain primarily does not depend on the lower brain stem structures such as the raphe nuclei and midbrain reticular formation.
Hypothalamic sleep-wakefulness mechanism usually receives strong influence from the suprachiasmatic nucleus, but it can exert its own ultradian "rhythms" (very irregular though) in intact rats or in rats with suprachiasmatic lesions.

Daily rhythms in sleep and waking performance are generated by the interplay of multiple external and internal oscillators.
These include the light-dark and social cycles, a circadian hypothalamic oscillator oscillating virtually independently of behavior, and a homeostatic oscillator driven primarily by sleep-wake behavior.
Both internal oscillators contribute to variation in many aspects of sleep and wakefulness (e.g., sleep timing and duration, REM sleep, non-REM sleep, REM density, sleep spindles, slow-wave sleep, electroencephalographic oscillations during wakefulness and sleep, and performance parameters, including attention and memory).
The relative contribution of the oscillators varies greatly between these variables.
Sleep and performance cannot be predicted by either oscillator independently but critically depend on their phase relationship and amplitude.
The homeostatic oscillator feeds back onto the central pacemaker or its outputs.
Thus, the amplitude of observed circadian variation in sleep and performance depends on how long we have been asleep or awake.
During entrainment to external 24-h cycles, the opposing interplay between circadian and homeostatic changes in sleep propensity consolidates sleep and wakefulness.
Some physiological correlates and mediators of both the circadian process (e.g., melatonin and hypocretin rhythms) and the homeostat (e.g., EEG, slow-wave activity, and adenosine release) have been established, offering targets for the development of countermeasures for circadian sleep and performance disorders.
Interindividual differences in sleep timing, duration, and morning or evening preference are associated with changes of circadian or sleep homeostatic processes or both.
Molecular genetic correlates, including polymorphisms in clock genes, of some of these interindividual differences are emerging.

20128854

Recent evidence suggests that synaptic plasticity occurs during homeostatic processes, including sleep-wakefulness regulation, although the underlying mechanisms are not well understood.
Polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA NCAM) is a transmembrane protein that has been implicated in various forms of plasticity.
To investigate whether PSA NCAM is involved in the neuronal plasticity associated with spontaneous sleep-wakefulness regulation and sleep homeostasis, four studies were conducted using rats.
First, we showed that PSA NCAM immunoreactivity is present in close proximity to key neurons in several nuclei of the sleep-wakefulness system, including the tuberomammillary hypothalamic nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, and locus coeruleus.
Second, using western blot analysis and densitometric image analysis of immunoreactivity, we found that 6 h of sleep deprivation changed neither the levels nor the general location of PSA NCAM in the sleep-wakefulness system.
Finally, we injected endoneuraminidase (Endo N) intracerebroventricularly to examine the effects of polysialic acid removal on sleep-wakefulness states and electroencephalogram (EEG) slow waves at both baseline and during recovery from 6 h of sleep deprivation.
Endo N-treated rats showed a small but significant decrease in baseline rapid eye movement (REM) sleep selectively in the late light phase, and a facilitated REM sleep rebound after sleep deprivation, as compared with saline-injected controls.
Non-REM sleep and wakefulness were unaffected by Endo.
These results suggest that PSA NCAM is not particularly involved in the regulation of wakefulness or non-REM sleep, but plays a role in the diurnal pattern of REM sleep as well as in some aspects of REM sleep homeostasis.

BACKGROUND: Previously, we have shown that transgenic cells bearing the GDNF gene with deleted pre- and pro-regions (mGDNF) can release transgenic GDNF.
The medium conditioned by transgenic cells with mGDNF induced axonal growth in rat embryonic spinal ganglion in vitro.
Here we demonstrate a neurotrophic effect of mGDNF on PC12 cells in vitro as well as its neuroprotective effect on dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta in vivo as indicated by improved motor coordination and sleep-wakefulness cycle in the MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease.
RESULTS: HEK293 cells were transfected with a vector encoding an isoform of the human GDNF gene with deleted pre- and pro-regions (mGDNF).
This factor in the medium conditioned by the transfected cells was shown to induce axonal growth in PC12 cells.
The early Parkinson's disease model was established by injection of the dopaminergic pro-neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) into C57Bl/6 mice.
Transgenic HEK293/mGDNF/GFP cells were transplanted into the striatum (caudate-putamen) of experimental mice.
The sleep-wakefulness cycle was studied by continuous EEG and motor activity monitoring 1 and 2 weeks after MPTP injection.
After the experiment, the motor coordination of experimental animals was evaluated in the rotarod test, and dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta were counted in cross-sections of the midbrain.
MPTP administration lowered the number of tyrosine hydroxylase immunopositive cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta, decreased motor coordination, and increased the total wake time during the dark period.
The transplantation of HEK293/mGDNF cells into the caudate-putamen 3 days prior to MPTP injection smoothed these effects, while the control transplantation of HEK293 cells showed no notable impact.
CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation of transgenic cells with the GDNF gene lacking the pre- and pro-sequences can protect dopaminergic neurons in the mouse midbrain from the subsequent administration of the pro-neurotoxin MPTP, which is confirmed by polysomnographic, behavioral and histochemical data.
Hence it is released from transfected cells and preserves the differentiation activity and neuroprotective properties.

The effects of microinjection of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and serotonin (5-HT) into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) on the activity of dopamine neurons in VTA and sleep-wakefulness were studied in rats.
It was observed that in aneasthetized rats microinjection of GABA (25 micrograms) and 5-HT (2 micrograms) respectively decreased or increased the level of 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) to 68.2% (P < 0.01) and to 136.1% (P < 0.01) of control value in the nucleus accumbens (Acb).
It was also observed that in free moving rats the time of wakefulness was respectively decreased and increased by the two drugs.
Furthermore, the time of wakefulness was enhanced following microinjection of dopamine (10 micrograms) into Acb, an effect that could be blocked by haloperidal (16 pmol), but not by SCH23390 (2 nmol).
The above results suggest that bilateral microinjection of GABA and 5-HT into VTA could exert respectively an inhibitory or an excitatory action on the dopamine neurons in VTA, mediating the sleep-wakefulness effect probably through the mesolimbic system.

The comparative immunohistochemical researches of dofamine containing neurons and fibers are carried uot in telencephalic and diencephalic departments of the brain in different vertebratts (adults rats, rats aged 14 and 30 days and frogs).
For analysis of quantitative changes dynamics in thyrozinhydroxylase, D1 and D2 immunoreactive material in sleep-wakefulness cycle the model of sleepdeprivation is used.
There are found the facts of morphofunctional correlations in the reactions of dophaminergic system during ontogeny and phylogeny.
Besides, the pharmacological effects of dofamine agonist and antagonists on the sleep-wakefulness cycle in young rats and in frogs are shown.
So, dopamine and its agonist apomorphine increase in sleep-wakefulness cycle duration of sleep-like state ofcataplexy (homolog of the sleep) in frogs, in 30-day-old rats it increase the share of wakefulness and catalepsy.
D1 receptors antagonist (SCH 23390) adminisrated to frogs, caused increase of wakefulness and catatonic type states duration, where as D2 receptors antagonist (apomorphine) increased cataleptic condition.
Administration of dopamine antagonist (haloperidol) to 30-day-old rats previously causes the increase of cataleptic state, after which the slow wave sleep state is enhanced.
The questions of phylo-, ontogenetic formation of dopaminergic system regulating role in sleep-wakefulness cycle, when transition mainly from neurosecretory diencephalic influences of dophamine to the mainly neurotransmittory functins of telencephalic regions occured, is discussed.

Increased bodily CO2 concentration alters cellular pH as well as sleep.
The proton pump, which plays an important role in the homeostatic regulation of cellular pH, therefore, may modulate sleep.
We investigated the effects of the proton pump inhibitor "lansoprazole" on sleep-wakefulness.
Male Wistar rats were surgically prepared for chronic polysomnographic recordings.
Two different doses of lansoprazole (low: 1 mg/kg; high: 10 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally in the same animal (n = 7) and sleep-wakefulness was recorded for 6 hrs.
The changes in sleep-wakefulness were compared statistically.
Percent REM sleep amount in the vehicle and lansoprazole low dose groups was 9.26 +/- 1.03 and 9.09 +/- 0.54, respectively, which increased significantly in the lansoprazole high dose group by 31.75% (from vehicle) and 34.21% (from low dose).
Also, REM sleep episode numbers significantly increased in lansoprazole high dose group.
Further, the sodium-hydrogen exchanger blocker "amiloride" (10 mg/kg; i p) (n = 5) did not alter sleep-wake architecture.
Our results suggest that the proton pump plays an important role in REM sleep modulation and supports our view that REM sleep might act as a sentinel to help maintain normal CO2 level for unperturbed sleep.

Deficiency of orexin, a newly discovered hypothalamic peptide, is thought to lead to abnormal sleepiness and cataplexy in both human narcolepsy and animal models of the disease.
As the POA contains extensive orexin terminals and is established as a sleep/arousal regulatory site, we evaluated a hypothesis that this site is a target for the arousal-inducing effects of orexin.
Orexin-A was microinjected into lateral preoptic area (IPOA) and the effects on sleep-wakefulness and brain temperature were studied.
Compared to saline vehicle control, orexin-A induced an increase in wakefulness for 70 min and suppressed all sleep stages, especially SWS2 and REM for 80 and 90 min, respectively.
Brain temperature was not differentially affected by orexin-A compared to saline control.
The orexin-induced arousal and REM suppression are consistent with the orexin-deficiency model of narcolepsy.
Our results suggest that the IPOA orexin terminal field or adjacent structures may be a locus of arousal regulation by this peptide and a substrate of sleep-wake regulatory deficits in narcolepsy.

Norepinephrine (NE)-containing locus ceruleus (LC) has been known to participate in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle according to the differential firing rate.
The aim of this study was to know the change of extracellular NE level in the rat amygdala, which are reciprocally connected with LC, during sleep-wakefulness.
Extracellular NE levels in the rat amygdala were investigated during different stages of the sleep-waking cycle using in vivo microdialysis and polygraphic recording.
Dialysates were collected every 5 min and correlated with the results of polygraphic recording.
The content of NE was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection.
NE level was the highest in active waking (AW) and, when compared to AW, NE level was progressively lower in quiet waking (QW; 86%), quiet sleep (QS; 72%), and active sleep (AS or REM sleep; 61%).
This result suggests that the rat amygdala also participates in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle according to the differential NE release.

The changes in brain temperature and sleep-wakefulness were studied in rats during their exposure to different ambient temperatures of 18 degrees C, 24 degrees C and 30 degrees C, before and after N-methyl D-aspartic acid lesion of the medial preoptic area.
The medial preoptic area lesion produced a decrease in sleep, and increase in brain temperature except at 30 degrees.
Increase and decrease in brain temperature with slow wave sleep and paradoxical sleep respectively, were observed both in normal and lesioned rats.
Sleep-wakefulness and brain temperature cycle durations were increased and their frequencies decreased at higher ambient temperature in normal rats.
After the medial preoptic area lesion, sleep-wakefulness cycle duration was decreased and frequency increased at 30 degrees.
There was no significant change in brain temperature cycles at higher ambient temperature in lesioned rats.
The medial preoptic area, in normal rats, possibly interlinks the neuronal circuits involved in regulating brain temperature and sleep-wakefulness cycles.
The medial preoptic area is essential for increasing the sleep-wakefulness cycle duration with higher ambient temperature.
The possible contribution of the increased brain temperature variation in producing sleep-wakefulness changes cannot be ruled out.
The results of the study show that this area may serve as a fine tuning mechanism which helps to interlink the sleep-wakefulness with the thermoregulation.

Increased activity of the histaminergic neurons of the posterior hypothalamus has been implicated in the facilitation of behavioral wakefulness.
Recent evidence of reciprocal projections between the sleep-active neurons of the preoptic/anterior hypothalamus and the histaminergic neurons of the tuberomammillary nucleus suggests that histaminergic innervation of the preoptic/anterior hypothalamic area may be of particular importance in the wakefulness-promoting properties of histamine.
To test this possibility, we used microdialysis sample collection in the preoptic/anterior hypothalamic area of cats during natural sleep-wakefulness cycles, 6 h of sleep deprivation induced by gentle handling/playing, and recovery sleep.
Samples were analyzed by a sensitive radioenzymatic assay.
Mean basal levels of histamine in microdialysate during periods of wakefulness (1.155+/-0.225 pg/microl) did not vary during the 6 h of sleep deprivation.
However, during the different sleep states, dramatic changes were observed in the extracellular histamine levels of preoptic/anterior hypothalamic area: wakefulness>non-rapid eye movement sleep>rapid eye movement sleep.
Levels of histamine during rapid eye movement sleep were lowest (0.245+/-0.032 pg/microl), being significantly lower than levels during non-rapid eye movement sleep (0.395+/-0.081 pg/microl) and being only 21% of wakefulness levels.
This pattern of preoptic/anterior hypothalamic area extracellular histamine levels across the sleep-wakefulness cycle closely resembles the reported single unit activity of histaminergic neurons.
However, the invariance of histamine levels during sleep deprivation suggests that changes in histamine level do not relay information about sleep drive to the sleep-promoting neurons of the preoptic/anterior hypothalamic area.

Both orexin and neurotensin are expressed in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) and have been implicated in the regulation of feeding, motor activity and the reward system.
A double label immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization studies showed that neurotensin colocalizes with orexin in neurons of the LHA.
Pharmacological studies suggested that neurotensin excites orexin-producing neurons (orexin neurons) through activation of neurotensin receptor-2 (NTSR-2) and non-selective cation channels.
In situ hybridization study showed that most orexin neurons express neurotensin receptor-2 mRNA but not neurotensin receptor-1 (Ntsr-1) mRNA.
Immunohistochemical studies showed that neurotensin-immunoreactive fibers make appositions to orexin neurons.
A neurotensin receptor antagonist decreased Fos expression in orexin neurons and wakefulness time in wild type mice when administered intraperitoneally.
However, the antagonist did not evoke any effect on these parameters in orexin neuron-ablated mice.
These observations suggest the importance of neurotensin in maintaining activity of orexin neurons.
The evidence presented here expands our understanding of the regulatory mechanism of orexin neurons.

We hypothesized that adenosine, acting via the A1 receptor, is a key factor in the homeostatic control of sleep.
The increase in extracellular levels of adenosine during prolonged wakefulness is thought to facilitate the transition to sleep by reducing the discharge activity of wakefulness-promoting neurons in the basal forebrain.
Adenosine A1 receptor control of the homeostatic regulation of sleep was tested by microdialysis perfusion of antisense oligonucleotides against the mRNA of the A1 receptor in the magnocellular cholinergic region of the basal forebrain of freely behaving rats.
After microdialysis perfusion of A1 receptor antisense in the basal forebrain, spontaneous levels of sleep-wakefulness showed a significant reduction in non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep with an increase in wakefulness.
After 6 hr of sleep deprivation, the antisense-treated animals spent a significantly reduced amount of time in non-REM sleep, with postdeprivation recovery sleep hours 2-5 showing a reduction of approximately 50-60%.
There was an even greater postdeprivation reduction in delta power (60-75%) and a concomitant increase in wakefulness.
All behavioral state changes returned to control (baseline) values after the cessation of antisense administration.
Control experiments with microdialysis perfusion of nonsense (randomized antisense) oligonucleotides and with artificial CSF showed no effect during postdeprivation recovery sleep or spontaneously occurring behavioral states.
Antisense to the A1 receptor suppressed A1 receptor immunoreactivity but did not show any neurotoxicity as visualized by Fluoro-Jade staining.
These data support our hypothesis that adenosine, acting via the A1 receptor, in the basal forebrain is a key component in the homeostatic regulation of sleep.

Biogenic amines, including acetylcholine, act as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators in the brain of mammals.
Accumulated evidences suggest the relevance of these amines to the regulatory system of sleep-wakefulness cycle.
Recent development of an in vivo, microdialysis technique has revealed the existence of circadian variation in the release of these amines from various brain regions related to the regulation of sleep-wakefulness.
This review focuses on the characteristics of the release of these amines determined by the microdialysis method in rats and cats during sleep-wakefulness cycle, and speculates their roles in the mechanism underlying the control of sleep and arousal state.

Daily cycles of wakefulness and sleep are regulated by coordinated interactions between wakefulness- and sleep-regulating neural circuitry.
Wakefulness is associated with neuronal activity in cholinergic neurons in the brainstem and basal forebrain, monoaminergic neurons in the brainstem and posterior hypothalamus, and hypocretin (orexin) neurons in the lateral hypothalamus that act in a coordinated manner to stimulate cortical activation on the one hand and behavioral arousal on the other hand.
Each of these neuronal groups subserves distinct aspects of wakefulness-related functions of the brain.
Normal transitions from wakefulness to sleep involve sleep-related inhibition and/or disfacilitation of the multiple arousal systems.
The cell groups that shut off the network of arousal systems, at sleep onset, occur with high density in the ventral lateral preoptic area (VLPO) and the median preoptic nucleus (MnPN) of the hypothalamus.
Preoptic neurons are activated during sleep and exhibit sleep-wake state-dependent discharge patterns that are reciprocal of that observed in several arousal systems.
Neurons in the VLPO contain the inhibitory neuromodulator, galanin, and the inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
The majority of MnPN sleep-active neurons synthesize GABA.
VLPO and MnPN neurons are sources of projections to arousal-regulatory systems in the posterior and lateral hypothalamus and the rostral brainstem.
Mechanisms of sleep induction by these nuclei are hypothesized to involve GABA-mediated inhibition of multiple arousal systems.
Normal cycling between discrete behavioral states is mediated by the combined influence of a sleep need that increases with continued wakefulness and an intrinsic circadian oscillation.
This chapter will review anatomical and functional properties of populations of sleep-/wake-regulating neurons, focusing on recent findings supporting functional significance of the VLPO and MnPN in the regulation of sleep--wake homeostasis.
Evidence indicating that MnPN and VLPO neurons have different, but complementary sleep regulatory functions will be summarized.
Potential mechanisms that function to couple activity in these two sleep-regulatory neurons will be discussed.

Narcolepsy with cataplexy is a sleep dysregulation disorder with alterations of REM sleep, i.e., sleep onset REM periods and REM sleep instability.
Deficient orexin-A (hypocretin-1) signaling is assumed to be a major cause of narcolepsy with cataplexy.
In this study we investigated fourteen subjects with narcolepsy with cataplexy in a within-subject, random-order crossover, placebo-controlled design.
Patients received double-blinded intranasal orexin-A (435 nmol) or sterile water (placebo) in the morning.
Administration was preceded by an adaptation night and followed by a modified maintenance of wakefulness test, attention testing and a second full night of polysomnographic recording.
We found comparable sleep behavior during the adaptation nights between both conditions.
After orexin-A administration patients had less wake-REM sleep transitions and a decreased REM sleep duration.
In the subsequent night, patients showed an increased N2 duration.
In the test of divided attention, patients had fewer false reactions after orexin-A administration.
Our results support orexin-A to be a REM sleep stabilizing factor and provide functional signs for effects of orexin-A on sleep alterations and attention in narcolepsy with cataplexy.

Sleep/wakefulness (S/W) disorders are frequent in Parkinson's disease (PD).
The underlying causes have yet to be elucidated but dopaminergic neurodegenerative lesions seem to contribute to appearance of the disorders and anti-Parkinsonian medication is known to accentuate S/W problems.
Hence, we reasoned that studying the acute effect of dopaminergic compounds on S/W in an animal model of PD might improve our knowledge of S/W regulation in the context of partial dopaminergic depletion.
To this end, we tested the effect of levodopa (l-dopa), pergolide (a mixed D(2)/D(1) agonist) and lisuride (a D(2) agonist) on S/W recordings in MPTP-treated mice, in comparison with controls.
Our results showed that dopaminergic compounds modify S/W amounts in both control and MPTP mice.
Wakefulness amounts are greater in MPTP mice after l-dopa (50 mg kg(-1)) and lisuride (1 mg kg(-1)) injections compared with control mice.
Moreover, the paradoxical sleep latency was significantly longer in MPTP mice after high-dose l-dopa administration.
Our observations suggest that the actions of both l-dopa and lisuride on S/W differ slightly in MPTP mice relative to controls.
Hence, MPTP-induced partial DA depletion may modulate the effect of dopaminergic compounds on S/W regulation.

The Daily Cognitive Communicative and Sleep Profile (DCCASP) is a seven-item instrument that captures daily subjective sleep quality, perceived mood, cognitive, and communication functions.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of the DCCASP.
The DCCASP was self-administered daily to a convenience sample of young adults (n = 54) for two two-week blocks, interspersed with a two-week rest period.
Afterwards, participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).
Internal consistency and criterion validity were calculated by Cronbach's alpha coefficient, Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC), and Spearman rank (rs) correlation coefficient, respectively.
Results indicated high internal consistency (Cronbach-s alpha = 0.864-0.938) among mean ratings of sleep quality on the DCCASP.
There were significant correlations between mean ratings of sleep quality and all domains (rs=0.38-0.55, p<0.0001).
Criterion validity was established between mean sleep quality ratings on the DCCASP and PSQI (rs=0.40, p<0.001).
The DCCASP is a reliable and valid self-report instrument to monitor daily sleep quality and perceived mood, cognitive, and communication functions over time, amongst a normative sample of young adults.
Further studies on its psychometric properties are necessary to clarify its utility in a clinical population.

Modification of brain muscarinic cholinergic system normal functioning can be considered as an appropriate strategy for the study of its role in sleep-wakefulness cycle basic mechanisms in general and in the course/maintenance of PS in particular.
For this aim systemic application of muscarinic cholinoreceptors antagonists is significant because it gives possibility to modify functioning all of known five sub-types of muscarinic cholinoreceptors and to study the character of sleep disturbances in these conditions.
Problem is very topical because the question about the intimate aspects of BMChS involvement in PS maintaining mechanisms still remains unsolved.
In cats Atropine systemic administration was made once daily at 10:00 a.m. and continuous EEG registration of sleep-wakefulness cycle ultradian structure, lasting for 10 hour daily, was started immediately.
In sum each animal received anti-muscarinic drugs for 12 times.
Thereafter drug administrations were ceased and EEG registration of sleep-wakefulness cycle ultradian structure was continued during 10 consecutive days.
On the basis of results obtained in these conditions we can conclude that brain muscarinic cholinergic system normal functioning is significant for basic mechanisms of sleep-wakefulness cycle.
During wakefulness, at the level of neocortex and hippocampus, MChS supports only EEG activation, while it is one of the main factors in PS triggering and maintaining mechanisms.

The role of GABA in medial preoptico-anterior hypothalamic area in the regulation of spontaneous sleep-wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep was investigated in this study.
Local microinjection of picrotoxin, a GABA-A antagonist, into this area increased quiet wakefulness but significantly reduced deep sleep and rapid eye movement sleep.
Both the frequency of generation and duration per episode of the latter were significantly reduced.
It is concluded that GABA-ergic neurotransmission in the medial preoptic area is spontaneously active in modulating the hypnogenic function including rapid eye movement sleep and the action is mediated by GABA-A receptor.

Hypothalamic neurons that contain the neuropeptide orexin (hypocretin) play important roles in the regulation of sleep/wake.
Here we analyze the in vivo and in vitro phenotype of mice lacking the GABA(B1) gene specifically in orexin neurons (oxGKO mice) and demonstrate that GABA(B) receptors on orexin neurons are essential in stabilizing and consolidating sleep/wake states.
In oxGKO brain slices, we show that the absence of GABA(B) receptors decreases the sensitivity of orexin neurons to both excitatory and inhibitory inputs because of augmented GABA(A)-mediated inhibition that increases the membrane conductance and shunts postsynaptic currents in these neurons.
This increase in GABA(A)-mediated inhibitory tone is apparently the result of an orexin receptor type 1-mediated activation of local GABAergic interneurons that project back onto orexin neurons.
oxGKO mice exhibit severe fragmentation of sleep/wake states during both the light and dark periods, without showing an abnormality in total sleep time or signs of cataplexy.
Thus, GABA(B) receptors on orexin neurons are crucial in the appropriate control of the orexinergic tone through sleep/wake states, thereby stabilizing the state switching mechanisms.

This study was undertaken to assess the role of catecholamine fibers, terminating in the preoptic area, in regulating sleep-wakefulness in rats.
Sleep-wakefulness was assessed on the basis of 24h electroencephalogram, electromyogram and electro-oculogram recordings before and after destruction of catecholaminergic terminals at the medial preoptic area by bilateral intracerebral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (8 microg in 0.2 microl).
There was a mild reduction in sleep and increase in wakefulness after the lesion.
The increase in active wakefulness observed after eight days of lesion persisted even on the 12th day.
In spite of the reduction in sleep, the day-night sleep ratio was not affected by 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of the preoptic area.
The results indicate that the noradrenergic fibers at the preoptic area have a hypnogenic role.

Exposure to severe stressors increases the risk for psychiatric disorders in vulnerable individuals, but can lead to positive outcomes for others.
However, it remains unknown how severe stress affects neural functioning in humans and what factors mediate individual differences in the neural sequelae of stress.
The amygdala is a key brain region involved in threat detection and fear regulation, and previous animal studies have suggested that stress sensitizes amygdala responsivity and reduces its regulation by the prefrontal cortex.
In this study, we used a prospective design to investigate the consequences of severe stress in soldiers before and after deployment to a combat zone.
We found that combat stress increased amygdala and insula reactivity to biologically salient stimuli across the group of combat-exposed individuals.
In contrast, its influence on amygdala coupling with the insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex was dependent on perceived threat, rather than actual exposure, suggesting that threat appraisal affects interoceptive awareness and amygdala regulation.
Our results demonstrate that combat stress has sustained consequences on neural responsivity, and suggest a key role for the appraisal of threat on an amygdala-centered neural network in the aftermath of severe stress.

Anxious emotion can manifest on brief (threat response) and/or persistent (chronic apprehension and arousal) timescales, and prior work has suggested that these signals are supported by separable neural circuitries.
This fMRI study utilized a mixed block-event-related emotional provocation paradigm in 55 healthy participants to simultaneously measure brief and persistent anxious emotional responses, testing the specificity of, and interactions between, these potentially distinct systems.
Results indicated that components of emotional processing networks were uniquely sensitive to transient and sustained anxious emotion.
Whereas the amygdala and midbrain showed only transient responses, the ventral basal forebrain and anterior insula showed sustained activity during extended emotional contexts that tracked positively with task-evoked anxiety.
States of lesser anxiety were associated with greater sustained activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.
Furthermore, ventromedial prefrontal recruitment was lower in individuals with higher scores on intolerance of uncertainty measures, and this hyporecruitment predicted greater transient amygdala responding to potential threat cues.
This work demonstrates how brain circuitries interact across temporal scales to support brief and persistent anxious emotion and suggests potentially divergent mechanisms of dysregulation in clinical syndromes marked by brief versus persistent symptoms of anxiety.

Sustained anticipatory anxiety is central to Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).
During anticipatory anxiety, phasic threat responding appears to be mediated by the amygdala, while sustained threat responding seems related to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST).
Although sustained anticipatory anxiety in GAD patients was proposed to be associated with BNST activity alterations, firm evidence is lacking.
We aimed to explore temporal characteristics of BNST and amygdala activity during threat anticipation in GAD patients.
Nineteen GAD patients and nineteen healthy controls (HC) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a temporally unpredictable threat anticipation paradigm.
We defined phasic and a systematic variation of sustained response models for blood oxygen level-dependent responses during threat anticipation, to disentangle temporally dissociable involvement of the BNST and the amygdala.
GAD patients relative to HC responded with increased phasic amygdala activity to onset of threat anticipation and with elevated sustained BNST activity that was delayed relative to the onset of threat anticipation.
Both the amygdala and the BNST displayed altered responses during threat anticipation in GAD patients, albeit with different time courses.
The results for the BNST activation hint towards its role in sustained threat responding, and contribute to a deeper understanding of pathological sustained anticipatory anxiety in GAD.

Anxiety disorders affect approximately 1 in 5 (18%) Americans within a given 1 year period, placing a substantial burden on the national health care system.
Therefore, there is a critical need to understand the neural mechanisms mediating anxiety symptoms.
We used unbiased, multimodal, data-driven, whole-brain measures of neural activity (magnetoencephalography) and connectivity (fMRI) to identify the regions of the brain that contribute most prominently to sustained anxiety.
We report that a single brain region, the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), shows both elevated neural activity and global brain connectivity during threat.
The IPS plays a key role in attention orienting and may contribute to the hypervigilance that is a common symptom of pathological anxiety.
Hyperactivation of this region during elevated state anxiety may account for the paradoxical facilitation of performance on tasks that require an external focus of attention, and impairment of performance on tasks that require an internal focus of attention.

BACKGROUND: Neuroimaging research has traditionally explored fear and anxiety in response to discrete threat cues (e.g., during fear conditioning).
However, anxiety is a sustained aversive state that can persist in the absence of discrete threats.
Little is known about mechanisms that maintain anxiety states over a prolonged period.
Here, we used a robust translational paradigm (threat of shock) to induce sustained anxiety.
Recent translational work has implicated an amygdala-prefrontal cortex (PFC) circuit in the maintenance of anxiety in rodents.
To explore the functional homologues of this circuitry in humans, we used a novel paradigm to examine the impact of sustained anticipatory anxiety on amygdala-PFC intrinsic connectivity.
METHODS: Task-independent fMRI data were collected in healthy participants during long-duration periods of shock anticipation and safety.
We examined intrinsic functional connectivity.
RESULTS: Our study involved 20 healthy participants.
During sustained anxiety, amygdala activity was positively coupled with dorsomedial PFC (DMPFC) activity.
High trait anxiety was associated with increased amygdala-DMPFC coupling.
In addition, induced anxiety was associated with positive coupling between regions involved in defensive responding, and decreased coupling between regions involved in emotional control and the default mode network.
LIMITATIONS: Inferences regarding anxious pathology should be made with caution because this study was conducted in healthy participants.
CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that anticipatory anxiety increases intrinsic amygdala-DMPFC coupling and that the DMPFC may serve as a functional homologue for the rodent prefrontal regions by sustaining anxiety.
Future research may use this defensive neural context to identify biomarkers of risk for anxious pathology and target these circuits for therapeutic intervention.

INTRODUCTION: Reducing fear when a threat has disappeared protects against a continuously elevated anxiety state.
In this study, we investigated the brain mechanism involved in this process.
METHODS: The threat paradigm consisted of discrete cues that signaled either threat of shock or safety.
Healthy participants were tested in two sessions in which eyeblink startle (n = 26) and blood oxygen level dependence (n = 23) were measured to index subjects' defensive state and brain responses respectively.
RESULTS: Startle results indicated that subjects could rapidly decrease their defensive state after the offset of shock threat.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging data indicated that the termination of threat was associated with the recruitment of lateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortices.
An exploratory connectivity analysis showed that activity in these prefrontal regions was linked and was also associated with activity in brain regions typically responding to threat, the right anterior insula and amygdala.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide first evidence for a prefrontal mechanism that functions to control anxiety after threat offset, which may be dysfunctional in patients who suffer from excessive sustained anxiety.
Moreover, the results support a model in which the lateral prefrontal cortex controls anxiety related limbic activity through connections with ventromedial prefrontal cortex.

An extensive body of research has demonstrated that anxious individuals abnormally process threat-related content.
Yet, the manner in which clinical anxiety affects the selection of threatening signals and their maintenance within consciousness is yet to be explored.
The present study used an emotional binocular rivalry (e-BR) procedure, in which pictures of faces depicting either fearful or neutral expressions competed with pictures of a house for conscious perception.
We assumed that first- or cumulative-preferred perception of faces with fearful over neutral expression (i.e., initial or sustained threat bias, respectively) stand for preferential selection or maintenance of fear content in awareness, correspondingly.
Unmedicated patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) and panic disorder (PAD) were compared to healthy controls for threat-related perceptual biases in the e-BR.
At first perception of face, both SAD and PAD patients showed a greater initial threat bias than healthy controls.
In contrast, at cumulative dwell-time of face, patient groups demonstrated a diminished sustained threat bias relative to healthy controls, yet in a different manner.
SAD patients showed a sustained threat bias, though it was smaller than in healthy controls.
Furthermore, increased levels of reported anxiety among SAD patients were associated with enhanced sustained perception of neutral faces.
PAD patients, on the other hand, showed no sustained threat bias and a diminished cumulative perception of fearful faces with increased levels of anxiety traits.
These findings indicate that anxiety disorders commonly involve an initially enhanced selection of threat signals into awareness, followed by disorder-specific manifestation of diminished preferred maintenance of threat in awareness.

The extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway has a key role in cell survival and brain plasticity, processes that are impaired following exposure to stressful situations.
We have recently validated two repeated intermittent stress procedures in male NMRI mice, social threat and repeated exposure to a novel cage, which result in clear behavioral effects following 4 weeks of application.
The present results demonstrate that both repeated intermittent stress procedures alter the activity of the ERK1/2 pathway in the brain, as shown by changes in phosphorylated ERK1/2 (phospho-ERK1/2) protein expression and in the expression of downstream proteins: phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), in the hippocampus, the frontal cortex and the hypothalamus.
The hippocampus showed greater responsiveness to stress as the two stressors increased phospho-ERK1/2 and BDNF expression under acute condition.
Following repeated stress, hyperphosphorylation of ERK1/2 was associated with up-regulation of hippocampal BDNF expression in the social threat group but not in mice exposed to novel cage.
This lack of a pro-survival effect of ERK1/2 with repeated novel cage exposure may constitute an early event in stress-mediated brain pathology.
The sustained BDNF up-regulation in the hippocampi of mice subjected to repeated social threat could be related to rewarding aspects of aggressive interactions, suggested by our previous studies.

Anticipation of potentially threatening social situations is a key process in social anxiety disorder (SAD).
In other anxiety disorders, recent research of neural correlates of anticipation of temporally unpredictable threat suggests a temporally dissociable involvement of amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) with phasic amygdala responses and sustained BNST activation.
However, the temporal profile of amygdala and BNST responses during temporal unpredictability of threat has not been investigated in patients suffering from SAD.
We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural activation in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and the BNST during anticipation of temporally unpredictable aversive (video camera observation) relative to neutral (no camera observation) events in SAD patients compared to healthy controls (HC).
For the analysis of fMRI data, we applied two regressors (phasic/sustained) within the same model to detect temporally dissociable brain responses.
The aversive condition induced increased anxiety in patients compared to HC.
SAD patients compared to HC showed increased phasic activation in the CeA and the BNST for anticipation of aversive relative to neutral events.
SAD patients as well as HC showed sustained activity alterations in the BNST for aversive relative to neutral anticipation.
No differential activity during sustained threat anticipation in SAD patients compared to HC was found.
Taken together, our study reveals both CeA and BNST involvement during threat anticipation in SAD patients.
The present results point towards potentially SAD-specific threat processing marked by elevated phasic but not sustained CeA and BNST responses when compared to HC.

Fear-potentiated acoustic startle paradigms have been used to investigate phasic and sustained components of conditioned fear in rats and humans.
This study describes a novel training protocol to assess phasic and sustained fear in freely behaving C57BL/6J mice, using freezing and/or fear-potentiated startle as measures of fear, thereby, if needed, allowing in vivo application of various techniques, such as optogenetics, electrophysiology and pharmacological intervention, in freely behaving animals.
An auditory Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm, with pseudo-randomized conditioned-unconditioned stimulus presentations at various durations, is combined with repetitive brief auditory white noise burst presentations during fear memory retrieval 24 h after fear conditioning.
Major findings are that (1) a motion sensitive platform built on mechano-electrical transducers enables measurement of startle responses in freely behaving mice, (2) absence or presence of startle stimuli during retrieval as well as unpredictability of a given threat determine phasic and sustained fear response profiles and (3) both freezing and startle responses indicate phasic and sustained components of behavioral fear, with sustained freezing reflecting unpredictability of conditioned stimulus (CS)/unconditioned stimulus (US) pairings.
This paradigm and available genetically modified mouse lines will pave the way for investigation of the molecular and neural mechanisms relating to the transition from phasic to sustained fear.

The brain circuits underlying behavioral fear have been extensively studied over the last decades.
Although the vast majority of experimental studies assess fear as a transient state of apprehension in response to a discrete threat, such phasic states of fear can shift to a sustained anxious apprehension, particularly in face of diffuse cues with unpredictable environmental contingencies.
Unpredictability, in turn, is considered an important variable contributing to anxiety disorders.
The networks of the extended amygdala have been suggested keys to the control of phasic and sustained states of fear, although the underlying synaptic pathways and mechanisms remain poorly understood.
Here, we show that the endocannabinoid system acting in synaptic circuits of the extended amygdala can explain the fear response profile during exposure to unpredictable threat.
Using fear training with predictable or unpredictable cues in mice, combined with local and cell-type-specific deficiency and rescue of cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors, we found that presynaptic CB1 receptors on distinct amygdala projections to bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) are both necessary and sufficient for the shift from phasic to sustained fear in response to an unpredictable threat.
These results thereby identify the causal role of a defined protein in a distinct brain pathway for the temporal development of a sustained state of anxious apprehension during unpredictability of environmental influences, reminiscent of anxiety symptoms in humans.

Downregulation of emotional responses to threat is strongly associated with frontal cortex functions.
Additionally pathological anxiety has been proposed to be associated with the altered frontal control.
Understanding the frontal regulation of both initial and sustained fear responses seems to be crucial for further research on the treatment of anxiety disorders.
Therefore, this study aims to examine the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) on the subjects' psychophysiological responses as measured by skin conductance reaction (SCR) during a sustained threat paradigm.
80 participants were randomly assigned to an anodal and sham stimulation group in a double-blinded manner.
Indicated by visual cues, participants anticipated the temporally unpredictable occurrence of aversive or neutral auditory stimuli.
We found a significant interaction effect of condition x tDCS for SCR during the sustained threat.
Post-hoc tests revealed a significant reduction in SCR during sustained fear in verum stimulated group.
The results confirm that tDCS of the rIFC attenuates sustained fear.
This supports the suggested role of the rIFC in psychophysiological emotional regulation and the potential use of tDCS to enhance these effects.

In contrast to a perceptible threat that releases freezing, fleeing and fighting, abstract potential threat elicits anxiety and vigilance.
The prevalent view is that the larger the animal groups the lower the individual vigilance.
Vigilance is a reflection of anxiety, and here we show that anxiety is contagious in grouped social animals.
In humans, anxiety frequently results in rituals that confer a sense of controllability and thereby a means to cope with anxiety.
Accordingly, in mental disorders with sustained anxiety, rituals predominate the behavior and consequently reduce functionality.
Finally, the adaptive value of precautionary behavior, including rituals, lies in providing individuals with the opportunity to practice defensive means safely, and thus to prepare for the eventuality of real danger.
Accordingly, the prevalence of anxiety in human and animal behavior accords with the "better safe than sorry" principle.

Processing task-irrelevant emotional information may compromise attention performance, particularly among those showing elevated threat sensitivity.
If threat-sensitive individuals are able to recruit attentional control to inhibit emotional processing, however, they may show few decrements in attention performance.
To examine this hypothesis, attention performance was measured in three domains--alerting, orienting, and executive attention.
Task-irrelevant fearful, sad, and happy faces were presented for 50 ms before each trial of the attention task to create a mildly competitive emotional context.
Electroencephalographic recordings were made from 64 scalp electrodes to generate event-related potentials (ERPs) to the faces.
Participants reporting high threat sensitivity showed enhanced ERPs thought to reflect emotional processing (P200) and attentional control (P100 and N200).
Enhanced N200 following fearful faces was linked to sustained and even slightly improved executive attention performance (reduced conflict interference) among high threat-sensitive individuals, but with decrements in executive attention among low threat-sensitive individuals.
Results are discussed in terms of cognitive processing efficiency and the balance between threat sensitivity and attentional control in relation to executive attention performance.
Results may have implications for understanding automatic and voluntary attentional biases related to anxiety.

Previous work has indicated that simple geometric shapes underlying facial expressions are capable of conveying emotional meaning.
Specifically, a series of studies found that a simple shape, a downward-pointing "V," which is similar to the geometric configuration of the face in angry expressions, is perceived as threatening.
A parallel line of research has determined that threatening stimuli more readily capture attention.
In five experiments, the authors sought to determine whether this preferential processing was also present for the simple geometric form of a downward-pointing "V." Using a visual search paradigm, across these experiments the authors found that, when embedded in a field of other shapes, downward-pointing V's were detected faster and, in some cases, more accurately than identical shapes pointing upward.
These findings indicate that the meaning of threat can be conveyed rapidly with minimal stimulus detail.
In addition, in some cases, during trials of homogeneous fields of stimuli, fields of downward-pointing V's led to slower response times, suggesting that this shape's ability to capture attention may also extend to difficulty in disengaging attention as well.

The goal of this study was to compare cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes associated with phasic cued fear versus those associated with sustained contextual anxiety.
Positron emission tomography images of CBF were acquired using [O-15]H2O in 17 healthy human subjects as they anticipated unpleasant electric shocks that were administered predictably (signaled by a visual cue) or unpredictably (threatened by the context).
Presentation of the cue in either threat condition was associated with increased CBF in the left amygdala.
A cue that specifically predicted the shock was associated with CBF increases in the ventral prefrontal cortex (PFC), hypothalamus, anterior cingulate cortex, left insula, and bilateral putamen.
The sustained threat context increased CBF in the right hippocampus, mid-cingulate gyrus, subgenual PFC, midbrain periaqueductal gray, thalamus, bilateral ventral striatum, and parieto-occipital cortex.
This study showed distinct neuronal networks involved in cued fear and contextual anxiety underlying the importance of this distinction for studies on the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders.

Many forms of human psychopathology are characterized by sustained negative emotional responses to threat and chronic behavioral avoidance, implicating avoidance as a potential transdiagnostic factor.
Evidence from both nonhuman neurophysiological and human neuroimaging studies suggests a distributed frontal-limbic-striatal brain network supports avoidance.
However, our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the network to sustained threat that prompts sustained avoidance is limited.
To address this issue, 17 adults were given extensive training on a modified free-operant avoidance task in which button pressing avoided money loss during a sustained threat period.
Subsequently, subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while completing the avoidance task.
In our regions of interest, we observed phasic, rather than sustained, activation during sustained threat in dorsolateral and inferior frontal regions, anterior and dorsal cingulate, ventral striatum and regions associated with emotion, including the amygdala, insula, substantia nigra and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis complex.
Moreover, trait levels of experiential avoidance were negatively correlated with insula, hippocampal and amygdala activation.
These findings suggest knowledge that one can consistently avoid aversive outcomes is not associated with decreased threat-related responses and that individuals with greater experiential avoidance exhibit reduced reactivity to initial threat.
Implications for understanding brain mechanisms supporting human avoidance and psychological theories of avoidance are discussed.

Data will be reviewed using the acoustic startle reflex in rats and humans based on our attempts to operationally define fear vs anxiety.
Although the symptoms of fear and anxiety are very similar, they also differ.
Fear is a generally adaptive state of apprehension that begins rapidly and dissipates quickly once the threat is removed (phasic fear).
Anxiety is elicited by less specific and less predictable threats, or by those that are physically or psychologically more distant.
Thus, anxiety is a more long-lasting state of apprehension (sustained fear).
Rodent studies suggest that phasic fear is mediated by the amygdala, which sends outputs to the hypothalamus and brainstem to produce symptoms of fear.
Sustained fear is also mediated by the amygdala, which releases corticotropin-releasing factor, a stress hormone that acts on receptors in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a part of the so-called 'extended amygdala.'
The amygdala and BNST send outputs to the same hypothalamic and brainstem targets to produce phasic and sustained fear, respectively.
In rats, sustained fear is more sensitive to anxiolytic drugs.
In humans, symptoms of clinical anxiety are better detected in sustained rather than phasic fear paradigms.

Anxiety can have both detrimental and facilitatory cognitive effects.
This study investigates the neural substrates of a replicated facilitatory effect of anxiety on sustained attention and response inhibition.
This effect consisted of improved performance on the Sustained Attention to Response Task (a Go-NoGo task consisting of 91% Go and 9% NoGo trials) in threat (unpredictable electrical shock) vs safe (no shock) conditions.
This study uses the same experimental design with fMRI and relies on an event-related analysis of BOLD signal changes.
Findings reveal that threat-related cognitive facilitation (improved NoGo accuracy) is associated with greater activation of a right-lateralized frontoparietal group of regions previously implicated in sustained attention and response inhibition.
Moreover, these same regions show decreased activation in the Go trials preceding NoGo errors.
During NoGo trials, striatal activity is also greater in the threat vs safe condition, consistent with the notion of enhanced inhibitory processing under threat.
These findings identify potential mechanisms by which threat of unpredictable shock can facilitate distinct cognitive functions.
A greater understanding of the complex interaction of the anxious state and cognitive processes may have critical clinical implications.

Uncertainty about future threat has been found to be associated with an overestimation of threat probability and is hypothesized to elicit additional allocation of attention.
We used event-related potentials to examine uncertainty-related dynamics in attentional allocation, exploiting brain potentials' high temporal resolution and sensitivity to attention.
Thirty participants performed a picture-viewing task in which cues indicated the subsequent picture valence.
A certain-neutral and a certain-aversive cue accurately predicted subsequent picture valence, whereas an uncertain cue did not.
Participants overestimated the effective frequency of aversive pictures following the uncertain cue, both during and after the task, signifying expectancy and covariation biases, and they tended to express lower subjective valences for aversive pictures presented after the uncertain cue.
Pictures elicited increased P2 and LPP amplitudes when their valence could not be predicted from the cue.
For the LPP, this effect was more pronounced in response to neutral pictures.
Uncertainty appears to enhance the engagement of early phasic and sustained attention for uncertainly cued targets.
Thus, defensive motivation related to uncertainty about future threat elicits specific attentional dynamics implicating prioritization at various processing stages, especially for nonthreatening stimuli that tend to violate expectations.

Anxious individuals show an attention bias towards threatening information.
However, under conditions of sustained environmental threat this otherwise-present attention bias disappears.
It remains unclear whether this suppression of attention bias can be caused by a transient activation of the fear system.
In the present experiment, high socially anxious and low socially anxious individuals (HSA group, n=12; LSA group, n=12) performed a modified dot-probe task in which they were shown either a neutral or socially threatening prime word prior to each trial.
EEG was collected and ERP components to the prime and faces displays were computed.
HSA individuals showed an attention bias to threat after a neutral prime, but no attention bias after a threatening prime, demonstrating that suppression of attention bias can occur after a transient activation of the fear system.
LSA individuals showed an opposite pattern: no evidence of a bias to threat with neutral primes but induction of an attention bias to threat following threatening primes.
ERP results suggested differential processing of the prime and faces displays by HSA and LSA individuals.
However, no group by prime interaction was found for any of ERP components.

Threatening stimuli have been shown to preferentially capture attention using a range of tasks and measures.
However, attentional bias to threat has not typically been found in unselected individuals using behavioral measures in the dot-probe task, one of the most common ways of examining attention to threat.
The present study leveraged event-related potentials (ERPs) in conjunction with behavioral measures in the dot-probe task to examine whether more direct measures of attention might reveal an attentional bias to threat in unselected individuals.
As in previous dot-probe studies, we found no evidence of an attentional bias to threat using reaction time; additionally, this measure exhibited poor internal reliability.
In contrast, ERPs revealed an initial shift of attention to threat-related stimuli, reflected by the N2pc, which showed moderate internal reliability.
However, there was no evidence of sustained engagement with the threat-related stimuli, as measured by the late positive potential (LPP).
Together, these results demonstrate that unselected individuals do initially allocate attention to threat in the dot-probe task, and further, that this bias is better characterized by neural measures of attention than traditional behavioral measures.
These results have implications for the study of attention to threat in both unselected and anxious populations.

Threat cues elicit defensive reactions mediated by limbic brain circuitry that is also implicated in risk-sensitive decision making.
Building upon research looking at stress effects on decision making, a gambling task was administered to 65 healthy adults, comparing decision making on trials on which a red screen background signalled threat of shocks against trials when shocks could not occur.
The threat cues elicited increased electrodermal activity and a sustained decrease in heart rate, consistent with defensive vigilance.
The threat condition was associated with risk-avoidant choices, on trials where the risky option involved moderate losses and when choosing between options involving only losses.
These effects were not explained by changes in latency.
Threat exerts immediate effects on decision making and physiological arousal, biasing subjects towards safer alternatives, potentially through a magnified processing of loss information.

BACKGROUND: The antihypertensive drug losartan has been shown to improve memory in humans as well as learning and fear extinction in rodent models, highlighting its potential to have similar synergistic effects on exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders.
This study investigated the effect of losartan on neural correlates of processing threat versus safety stimuli in highly anxious individuals to identify potential pathways of how the drug might facilitate psychological treatment.
METHODS: Thirty healthy volunteers high in trait anxiety were randomly assigned to a single dose of losartan (50 mg) versus placebo before undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging.
We measured brain response to happy and fearful faces presented for 80 seconds to assess emotional processing and habituation over time.
RESULTS: The placebo group showed similarly high left amygdala activation early on during presentation of fearful and happy faces, which decreased over time.
In contrast, losartan reduced amygdala response to happy faces early on.
In response to fearful faces, the drug prevented habituation, caused sustained amygdala activation, and led to increased activation in other brain areas associated with threat processing, such as the insula and putamen.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest two distinct effects of losartan on emotional processing, including an improvement of early discrimination of stimuli as threatening versus safe, and facilitation of threat processing.
Both processes are known to be relevant for successful exposure, highlighting two potential pathways by which losartan might exert facilitative effects on psychological treatment.

Pervasive avoidance behaviour is a core feature of anxiety disorders.
However, little is known about how the availability of avoidance modulates learned threat responding.
To assess this question, we recorded avoidance behaviour, electrodermal activity and expectancy ratings in 53 healthy participants during an associative learning paradigm with embedded unavoidable and avoidable trials.
When avoidance was available, we observed greater avoidance behaviour for threat versus safety cues, as well as reduced differential skin conductance responses for unavoidable threat versus safety cues.
When avoidance was unavailable, as during the extinction phase, we observed sustained differential skin conductance responses for threat versus safety cues.
For all phases, we found greater expectancy ratings for threat versus safe cues.
Furthermore, greater avoidance behaviour predicted larger differential skin conductance responses to threat versus safety cues during extinction.
Overall, the results show that the conditioned response is attenuated during situations where avoidance is available, but it recovers when avoidance is unavailable, subsequently prolonging threat extinction.

Cognitive theories of anxiety psychopathology cite biased attention towards threat as a central vulnerability and maintaining factor.
However, many studies have found threat bias indices to have poor reliability and have failed to observe the theorized relationship between threat bias and anxiety symptoms; this may be due to the non-unitary nature of threat bias and the influence of state-level variables on its expression.
Accumulating data suggests that state anxious mood is important for the robust expression of threat bias and for relations to emerge between threat bias and symptoms, though this possibility has not been experimentally tested.
Eye-tracking was used to assess multiple forms of threat bias (i.e., early vigilance, sustained attention, facilitated engagement, delayed disengagement) thought to be related to anxiety.
A non-clinical sample (N = 165) was recruited to test the hypothesis that biased attention towards threat, but not dysphoric or positive emotional stimuli, during an anxious mood induction, but not at a pre-stress baseline, would prospectively predict greater worry symptoms on days in which more naturalistic stressors occurred.
Results revealed the hypothesized moderation effect for sustained attention towards threat after the mood induction but not at baseline, though sustained attention towards dysphoric stimuli also moderated the effect of stressors on worry.
Worry-relevant sustained attention towards negative emotional stimuli may be a partially mood-context dependent phenomenon.

Entering a state of anxious anticipation triggers widespread changes across large-scale networks in the brain.
The temporal aspects of this transition into an anxious state are poorly understood.
To address this question, an instructed threat of shock paradigm was used while recording functional MRI in humans to measure how activation and functional connectivity change over time across the salience, executive, and task-negative networks and how they interact with key regions implicated in emotional processing; the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST).
Transitions into threat blocks were associated with transient responses in regions of the salience network and sustained responses in a putative BNST site, among others.
Multivariate network measures of communication were computed, revealing changes to network organization during transient and sustained periods of threat, too.
For example, the salience network exhibited a transient increase in network efficiency followed by a period of sustained decreased efficiency.
The amygdala became more central to network function (as assessed via betweenness centrality) during threat across all participants, and the extent to which the BNST became more central during threat depended on self-reported anxiety.
Together, our study unraveled a progression of responses and network-level changes due to sustained threat.
In particular, our results reveal how network organization unfolds with time during periods of anxious anticipation.

This study investigated whether attentional processes contribute to fear-potentiated startle.
Ten subjects participated in a threat of shock experiment and an attentional control condition.
In the threat of shock experiment, visual cues indicated whether or not an aversive shock might occur.
In the attentional control, the shocks were replaced by faint vibrotactile stimuli that had to be counted.
The P300 amplitudes of the ERP evoked by the visual cues did not differ under threat and counting, which suggested that both conditions engaged attention to the same extent.
In contrast, startle potentiation in the threat condition was an order of magnitude larger than the marginally significant attentional startle facilitation in the counting condition.
These results indicate that an attentional contribution to fear-potentiated startle under the present experimental conditions is small.
In addition, contextual effects of threat of shock became manifest as baseline startle was facilitated relative to the attention condition.
This may reflect a more sustained state of anxiety on which cue-specific fear responses are superimposed.

Research has highlighted the need for new methods to assess emotions in children on multiple levels to gain better insight into the complex processes of emotional development.
The startle reflex is a unique translational tool that has been used to study physiological processes during fear and anxiety in rodents and in human participants.
However, it has been challenging to implement developmentally appropriate startle experiments in children.
This article describes a procedure that uses predictable and unpredictable aversive events to distinguish between phasic fear and sustained anxiety in children and adolescents.
We investigated anxious responses, as measured with the startle reflex, in youths (N=36, mean age=12.63 years, range=7-17) across three conditions: no aversive events (N), predictable aversive events (P), and unpredictable aversive events (U).
Short-duration cues were presented several times in each condition.
Aversive events were signaled by the cues in the P condition but were presented randomly in the U condition.
Participants showed fear-potentiated startle to the threat cue in the P condition.
Startle responses were also elevated between cues in the U condition compared with the N condition, suggesting that unpredictable aversive events can evoke a sustained state of anxiety in youths.
This latter effect was influenced by sex, being greater in girls than in boys.
These findings indicate the feasibility of this experimental induction of the startle reflex in response to predictable and unpredictable events in children and adolescents, enabling future research on interindividual differences in fear and anxiety and their development in youths.

Threat stimuli are considered to be processed with higher priority due to an automatic threat detection system that enables rapid shifts of attention.
However, direct evidence is still missing.
The present study used the face-in-the-crowd task and event-related potentials to find evidence for the functionality of attention shifts in threat detection.
The threat detection advantage was replicated in the behavioral results.
An N2pc was observed that was more pronounced and earlier for angry compared to happy faces, suggesting differential attention allocation underlying the threat detection advantage.
A larger sustained posterior contralateral negativity indicated that angry faces also gained more enhanced subsequent processing.
An early posterior negativity observed 160 ms after stimulus onset revealed early emotion-specific processing that may have caused differences in attention allocation toward threatening stimuli.

Aversive events are typically more debilitating when they occur unpredictably than predictably.
Studies in humans and animals indicate that predictable and unpredictable aversive events can induce phasic and sustained fear, respectively.
Research in rodents suggests that anatomically related but distinct neural circuits may mediate phasic and sustained fear.
We explored this issue in humans by examining threat predictability in three virtual reality contexts, one in which electric shocks were predictably signaled by a cue, a second in which shocks occurred unpredictably but never paired with a cue, and a third in which no shocks were delivered.
Evidence of threat-induced phasic and sustained fear was presented using fear ratings and skin conductance.
Utilizing recent advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we were able to conduct whole-brain fMRI at relatively high spatial resolution and still have enough sensitivity to detect transient and sustained signal changes in the basal forebrain.
We found that both predictable and unpredictable threat evoked transient activity in the dorsal amygdala, but that only unpredictable threat produced sustained activity in a forebrain region corresponding to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis complex.
Consistent with animal models hypothesizing a role for the cortex in generating sustained fear, sustained signal increases to unpredictable threat were also found in anterior insula and a frontoparietal cortical network associated with hypervigilance.
In addition, unpredictable threat led to transient activity in the ventral amygdala-hippocampal area and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, as well as transient activation and subsequent deactivation of subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, limbic structures that have been implicated in the regulation of emotional behavior and stress responses.
In line with basic findings in rodents, these results provide evidence that phasic and sustained fear in humans may manifest similar signs of distress, but appear to be associated with different patterns of neural activity in the human basal forebrain.

BACKGROUND: Panic disorder (PD) patients are constantly concerned about future panic attacks and exhibit general hypersensitivity to unpredictable threat.
We aimed to reveal phasic and sustained brain responses and functional connectivity of the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) during threat anticipation in PD.
METHODS: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated 17 PD patients and 19 healthy controls (HC) during anticipation of temporally unpredictable aversive and neutral sounds.
We used a phasic and sustained analysis model to disentangle temporally dissociable brain activations.
RESULTS: PD patients compared with HC showed phasic amygdala and sustained BNST responses during anticipation of aversive v. neutral stimuli.
Furthermore, increased phasic activation was observed in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula and prefrontal cortex (PFC).
Insula and PFC also showed sustained activation.
Functional connectivity analyses revealed partly distinct phasic and sustained networks.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a role for the BNST during unpredictable threat anticipation in PD and provide first evidence for dissociation between phasic amygdala and sustained BNST activation and their functional connectivity.
In line with a hypersensitivity to uncertainty in PD, our results suggest time-dependent involvement of brain regions related to fear and anxiety.

We examined whether amygdala responses to rapidly presented fear expressions are preferentially tuned to averted vs direct gaze fear and conversely whether responses to more sustained presentations are preferentially tuned to direct vs averted gaze fear.
We conducted three functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies to test these predictions including: Study 1: a block design employing sustained presentations (1 s) of averted vs direct gaze fear expressions taken from the Pictures of Facial Affect; Study 2: a block design employing rapid presentations (300 ms) of these same stimuli and Study 3: a direct replication of these studies in the context of a single experiment using stimuli selected from the NimStim Emotional Face Stimuli.
Together, these studies provide evidence consistent with an early, reflexive amygdala response tuned to clear threat and a later reflective response tuned to ambiguous threat.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the re-emerging Ebola virus disease (EVD) are closely intertwined and remain a persistent public health threat and global challenge.
Their origin and rapid transmission and spread have similar boundaries and share overlapping impact characteristics, including related symptoms and other interactions.
The controversies and global threat of these viruses require rapid response policy and evidence-based implementation findings.
The constraints and dual burden inflicted by Ebola and HIV infections are highly characterized by similar socio-demographics, socio-economic and political factors.
EVD has similar effects and burdens to HIV infection.
This study seeks to understand EVD in the context of HIV epidemic despite the challenges in developing an effective vaccine against HIV and EVD.
Our findings show that early understanding, prevention and treatment of these diseases a global health threat mainly in Africa is important and valuable.
The lessons learned so far from HIV and Ebola epidemics are crucial in health programming and execution of rapid response interventions and continued vigilance against EVD before it become another worldwide health menace.
Therefore, the current regional West Africa EVD requires strengthening healthcare systems and building preparedness and response capacity.
Importantly, appropriate community participation, health education and resilience coupled with deployment of effective novel diagnostic approaches in early warning and surveillance of threats and emerging diseases.
Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel key strategies are crucial in curbing the constant viral resurgence, persistence transmission dynamics and spread, as well in accelerating Ebola vaccines regimen (immunization) development and national implementation plans in achieving sustained control, and eventual elimination.

During the past decade several notable viruses have suddenly emerged from obscurity or anonymity to become serious global health threats, provoking concern regarding their sustained epidemic transmission in immunologically naive human populations.
With each new threat comes the call for rapid vaccine development.
Indeed, vaccines are considered a critical component of disease prevention for emerging viral infections because, in many cases, other medical options are limited or non-existent, or that infections result in such a rapid clinical deterioration that the effectiveness of therapeutics is limited.
While classic approaches to vaccine development are still amenable to emerging viruses, the application of molecular techniques in virology has profoundly influenced our understanding of virus biology, and vaccination methods based on replicating, attenuated and non-replicating virus vector approaches have become useful vaccine platforms.
Together with a growing understanding of viral disease emergence, a range of vaccine strategies and international commitment to underpin development, vaccine intervention for new and emerging viruses may become a possibility.

Typically in the laboratory, cognitive and emotional processes are studied separately or as a stream of fleeting emotional stimuli embedded within a cognitive task.
Yet in life, thoughts and actions often occur in more lasting emotional states of arousal.
The current study examines the impact of emotions on actions using a novel behavioral paradigm and functional neuroimaging to assess cognitive control under sustained states of threat (anticipation of an aversive noise) and excitement (anticipation of winning money).
Thirty-eight healthy adult participants were scanned while performing an emotional go/no-go task with positive (happy faces), negative (fearful faces), and neutral (calm faces) emotional cues, under threat or excitement.
Cognitive control performance was enhanced during the excited state relative to a nonarousing control condition.
This enhanced performance was paralleled by heightened activity of frontoparietal and frontostriatal circuitry.
In contrast, under persistent threat, cognitive control was diminished when the valence of the emotional cue conflicted with the emotional state.
Successful task performance in this conflicting emotional condition was associated with increased activity in the posterior cingulate cortex, a default mode network region implicated in complex processes such as processing emotions in the context of self and monitoring performance.
This region showed positive coupling with frontoparietal circuitry implicated in cognitive control, providing support for a role of the posterior cingulate cortex in mobilizing cognitive resources to improve performance.
These findings suggest that emotional states of arousal differentially modulate cognitive control and point to the potential utility of this paradigm for understanding effects of situational and pathological states of arousal on behavior.
