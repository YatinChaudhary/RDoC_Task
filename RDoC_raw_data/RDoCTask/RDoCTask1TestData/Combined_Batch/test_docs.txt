30555220<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Acute Cancer Cognitive Therapy.<<>>The utility of cognitive therapy (CT) for ambulatory cancer patients is clear but the acute cancer setting significantly shapes the therapeutic interaction, parameters, and delivery of CT. In this article, we describe how to apply CT to acute cancer settings, focusing on how this approach differs from traditionally taught, ambulatory CT. We highlight the importance of a tailored history and formulation, how the cognitive model is applied within an acute cancer context to promote coping and adaptation. Reframing must consider the "grain of truth" to many so-called distorted cognitions, such as "cancer means death." Fear of recurrence is an example of a common reframing challenge. Another is the "tyranny of positive thinking." Here there is avoidance of considering negative outcomes such as death; patients are told to "think positive," leaving them alone at a time of life-threatening crisis. Instead, acute cancer CT utilizes a stance of realistic optimism. Empathy plays a vital role in turning off the bracing reaction to threat and facilitating problem-solving. Successfully combining CT with medications is integral to this model. We also discuss how CT can be applied to discussing prognosis, the desire for hastened death and suicidality, as well as death and dying in general. Because of the ubiquitous nature of cancer, most cognitive therapists will encounter patients with cancer in their practices. Acute cancer CT is a skill set that should be widely taught to cognitive therapists and flagged as a priority for academic programs and professional organizations.
29515465<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Threat Response System: Parallel Brain Processes in Pain vis-a-vis Fear and Anxiety.<<>>Pain is essential for avoidance of tissue damage and for promotion of healing. Notwithstanding the survival value, pain brings about emotional suffering reflected in fear and anxiety, which in turn augment pain thus giving rise to a self-sustaining feedforward loop. Given such reciprocal relationships, the present article uses neuroscientific conceptualizations of fear and anxiety as a theoretical framework for hitherto insufficiently understood pathophysiological mechanisms underlying chronic pain. To that end, searches of PubMed-indexed journals were performed using the following Medical Subject Headings' terms: pain and nociception plus amygdala, anxiety, cognitive, fear, sensory, and unconscious. Recursive sets of scientific and clinical evidence extracted from this literature review were summarized within the following key areas: (1) parallelism between acute pain and fear and between chronic pain and anxiety; (2) all are related to the evasion of sensory-perceived threats and are subserved by subcortical circuits mediating automatic threat-induced physiologic responses and defensive actions in conjunction with higher order corticolimbic networks (e.g., thalamocortical, thalamo-striato-cortical and amygdalo-cortical) generating conscious representations and valuation-based adaptive behaviors; (3) some instances of chronic pain and anxiety conditions are driven by the failure to diminish or block respective nociceptive information or unconscious treats from reaching conscious awareness; and (4) the neural correlates of pain-related conscious states and cognitions may become autonomous (i.e., dissociated) from the subcortical activity/function leading to the eventual chronicity. Identifying relative contributions of the diverse neuroanatomical sources, thus, offers prospects for the development of novel preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies in chronic pain patients.
12390587<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Motivation as a crucial predictor of good compliance in adolescents with rheumatoid arthritis.<<>>The purpose of this study was to identify the predictors of compliance shown by adolescents with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA). Three hundred individuals aged 13-17 years were randomly selected from the Finnish Social Insurance Institution's register. The questionnaires were sent to the adolescents selected from the register to be returned directly to the researcher in a self-addressed envelope. Ninety-one per cent (n = 274) returned the questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to find the factors that predicted compliance with health regimens. The compliance of adolescents with JRA was predicted on the basis of motivation, fear of acute problems, support from nurses, energy and willpower, and threat to social well-being. The most powerful predictor was motivation. The likelihood of the adolescents who had good motivation to comply with health regimens was 29.13-fold compared to the adolescents who did not have good motivation. The next powerful predictor was fear of acute problems. The adolescents who felt fear of acute problems complied with health regimens with a 20.35-fold likelihood compared to the adolescents who did not have fears. The third powerful predictor was support from nurses. The likelihood of adolescents supported by nurse to comply with health regimens was 17.03-fold compared to the adolescents who did not receive support from nurses. The likelihood of adolescents who had energy and willpower to comply with health regimens was 7.56-fold compared to the adolescents who did not have energy and willpower. Also, the threat to social well-being predicted good compliance.
16281194<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression in survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).<<>>This study examines the psychological impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 195 adult patients in Hong Kong. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were administered to patients 1 month after their discharge. Of the participants 10% to 18% reported symptoms related to posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression. Symptom severity was associated with high perceived life threat and low emotional support. Women and participants who had low education level were more likely to have symptoms of avoidance. Participants who personally knew someone who had SARS were more likely to be affected by depressive symptoms.
29329979<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>How acute stress may enhance subsequent memory for threat stimuli outside the focus of attention: DLPFC-amygdala decoupling.<<>>Stress-related disorders, e.g., anxiety and depression, are characterized by decreased top-down control for distracting information, as well as a memory bias for threatening information. However, it is unclear how acute stress biases mnemonic encoding and leads to prioritized storage of threat-related information even if outside the focus of attention. In the current study, healthy adults (N=53, all male) were randomly assigned to stress induction using the socially evaluated cold-pressor test (SECPT) or a control condition. Participants performed a task in which they were required to identify a target letter within a string of letters that were either identical to the target and thereby facilitating detection (low distractor load) or mixed with other letters to complicate the search (high load). Either a fearful or neutral face was presented on the background, outside the focus of attention. Twenty-four hours later, participants were asked to perform a surprise recognition memory test for those background faces. Stress induction resulted in increased cortisol and negative subjective mood ratings. Stress did not affect visual search performance, however, participants in the stress group showed stronger memory compared to the control group for fearful faces in the low attentional load condition. Critically, the stress induced memory bias was accompanied by decoupling between amygdala and DLFPC during encoding, which may represent a mechanism for decreased ability to filter task-irrelevant threatening background information. The current study provides a potential neural account for how stress can produce a negative memory bias for threatening information even if presented outside the focus of attention. Despite of an adaptive advantage for survival, such tendencies may ultimately also lead to generalized fear, a possibility requiring additional investigation.
22542915<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Pain catastrophizing, threat, and the informational value of mood: task persistence during a painful finger pressing task.<<>>Pain catastrophizing has shown to predict avoidance behavior in acute and chronic pain, but the literature is inconsistent. The present study tested the hypothesis that current mood and threat context moderate the relationship between pain catastrophizing and performance duration. Affective-motivational models postulate that negative and positive moods provide information about whether an activity is respectively threatening or safe. Moreover, it has been proposed that stable cognitive schemas about threat influence behavior particularly in threat-relevant contexts. The present study aimed to establish whether pain catastrophizing is related to less or greater performance duration, when participants experience respectively negative or positive moods, particularly in a high threatening pain context. A 2 mood x 2 threat context between-subjects factorial design was applied in 89 healthy participants with pain catastrophizing as covariate and performance duration during a painful finger pressing task as dependent variables. As predicted, higher pain catastrophizing was associated with less performance duration when participants experienced negative moods. The opposite was found when participants experienced positive moods. Moreover, these relationships were most pronounced in a high threatening pain context. This study suggests that the relationship between pain catastrophizing and performance duration during painful activities is moderated by situational factors such as current mood and threat context.
27774680<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Threat and fear of pain induces attentional bias to pain words: An eye-tracking study.<<>>BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the effects of fear of pain (FOP) and threat on attentional biases, using eye-tracking methods. METHOD: One hundred and seven undergraduate students were randomized to receive threatening or reassuring information about the cold pressor task; and divided into high and low FOP groups. Participants completed the dot-probe task, while their eye movements were tracked. RESULTS: Results showed that those who received threatening information were less likely to have their first fixation on pain words, particularly affective pain words. Furthermore, under conditions of high threat, the high FOP group who did fixate on affective pain words, fixated more quickly than for sensory pain words, whereas the opposite was the case under low threat. In regression analyses, initial vigilance towards affective pain words was a significant predictor of reporting pain more quickly on the cold pressor. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest that initial vigilance of affective pain stimuli predicts actual hypervigilance to an acute experimental pain task. However, under conditions of high threat, participants show evidence of avoidance of affective pain words, even though when they do fixate on these stimuli, the high FOP group does so more quickly. These results confirm that attentional processes, characterized by vigilance avoidance, appear important. SIGNIFICANCE: Interventions that change attention towards pain to reduce vigilance and subsequent avoidance may be indicated to improve pain outcomes.
27348069<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>The role of perceived threat in the emergence of PTSD and depression symptoms during warzone deployment.<<>>OBJECTIVE: Numerous studies have shown that level of exposure to combat-related stressors is a robust risk factor for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression among military personnel deployed to a warzone. Threat perception of warzone experiences assessed retrospectively has been consistently linked to increased risk for PTSD and depression months or even years after returning from deployment. However, little is known about concurrent relations between perceived threat, deployment stress, and stress-related symptoms during deployment. Using a novel in-theater web-based assessment system, we investigated the unique and joint contribution of threat perception and deployment stressors in predicting the emergence of PTSD and depression symptoms during deployment. METHOD: Soldiers (N = 150) completed assessments of deployment stressors, perceived threat, PTSD symptoms, and depression symptoms throughout deployment to Iraq. RESULTS: Results revealed that perceived threat potentiated the increase in PTSD symptoms as a result of increases in deployment stressors. In contrast, perceived threat, but not warzone stressors, uniquely predicted depression symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the important role of threat perception as a risk marker for the acute experience of depression and PTSD symptoms during deployment. (PsycINFO Database Record
23169690<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>A comparison of the effect of mindfulness and relaxation on responses to acute experimental pain.<<>>BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of mindfulness training in comparison with relaxation training on pain, threshold and tolerance during the cold pressor task. METHODS: Undergraduate psychology students (n = 140) were randomly assigned to receive reassuring or threatening information about the cold pressor. Participants were then re-randomized to receive mindfulness or a control intervention: relaxation training. RESULTS: Analyses confirmed that the threat manipulation was effective in increasing worry, fear of harm and expectations of pain, and reducing coping efficacy. Interaction effects revealed that mindfulness was effective in increasing curiosity and reducing decentring under conditions of high threat but not low threat. Other interactions on cognitive variables (attentional bias to pain and self-focus) confirmed that mindfulness and relaxation appeared to exert influences under different conditions (i.e. mindfulness: high threat; and relaxation: low threat). Despite these cognitive effects being discerned under different conditions, there were no differences between mindfulness and relaxation on pain, tolerance or threshold in either threat group. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that a single, brief session of mindfulness based on body scanning is not sufficient to change the way in which individuals approach an experimental pain task in comparison with relaxation, which has previously been shown to be ineffective.
22626868<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Trait mindfulness modulates neuroendocrine and affective responses to social evaluative threat.<<>>BACKGROUND: Individual differences in mindfulness have been associated with numerous self-report indicators of stress, but research has not examined how mindfulness may buffer neuroendocrine and psychological stress responses under controlled laboratory conditions. The present study investigated the role of trait mindfulness in buffering cortisol and affective responses to a social evaluative stress challenge versus a control task. METHODS: Participants completed measures of trait mindfulness, perceived stress, anxiety, and fear of negative evaluation before being randomized to complete the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST; Kirschbaum et al., 1993) or a control task. At points throughout the session, participants provided five saliva samples to assess cortisol response patterns, and completed four self-report measures of anxiety and negative affect to assess psychological responses. RESULTS: In accord with hypotheses, higher trait mindfulness predicted lower cortisol responses to the TSST, relative to the control task, as well as lower anxiety and negative affect. These relations remained significant when controlling for the role of other variables that predicted cortisol and affective responses. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that trait mindfulness modulates cortisol and affective responses to an acute social stressor. Further research is needed to understand the neural pathways through which mindfulness impacts these responses.
26048679<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Depression history as a moderator of relations between cortisol and shame responses to social-evaluative threat in young adults.<<>>Changes in cortisol and shame are commonly elicited by psychosocial stressors involving social-evaluative threat. According to social self preservation theory, this coordinated psychobiological response is adaptive. Individuals with a history of depression, however, may exhibit diminished cortisol reactivity to acute stressors, which could interfere with coordinated cortisol and shame responses. The present study examined temporal relations between cortisol and shame responses to a psychosocial stress task in young adults who varied in their history of depression (56 remitted-depressed, 46 never-depressed). Lagged effects multilevel models revealed that depression history moderated relations between cortisol levels and shame ratings 25-55min later. The pattern of these interactions was similar: whereas higher cortisol levels predicted increases in shame in never-depressed individuals, cortisol levels were unrelated to shame responses in remitted-depressed individuals. Findings suggest a dissociation between cortisol and shame responses to stress in individuals with a history of depression.
15337864<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Freeze, flight, fight, fright, faint: adaptationist perspectives on the acute stress response spectrum.<<>>This article reviews the existing evolutionary perspectives on the acute stress response habitual faintness and blood-injection-injury type-specific phobia (BIITS phobia). In this article, an alternative evolutionary perspective, based on recent advances in evolutionary psychology, is proposed. Specifically, that fear-induced faintness (eg, fainting following the sight of a syringe, blood, or following a trivial skin injury) is a distinct Homo sapiens-specific extreme-stress survival response to an inescapable threat. The article suggests that faintness evolved in response to middle paleolithic intra-group and inter-group violence (of con-specifics) rather than as a pan-mammalian defense response, as is presently assumed. Based on recent literature, freeze, flight, fight, fright, faint provides a more complete description of the human acute stress response sequence than current descriptions. Faintness, one of three primary physiological reactions involved in BIITS phobia, is extremely rare in other phobias. Since heritability estimates are higher for faintness than for fears or phobias, the author suggests that trait-faintness may be a useful complement to trait-anxiety as an endophenotype in research on the human fear circuitry. Some implications for the forthcoming Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition as well as for clinical, health services, and transcriptomic research are briefly discussed.
16563589<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Human brain evolution and the "Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle:" Implications for the Reclassification of fear-circuitry-related traits in DSM-V and for studying resilience to warzone-related posttraumatic stress disorder.<<>>The DSM-III, DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 have judiciously minimized discussion of etiologies to distance clinical psychiatry from Freudian psychoanalysis. With this goal mostly achieved, discussion of etiological factors should be reintroduced into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V). A research agenda for the DSM-V advocated the "development of a pathophysiologically based classification system". The author critically reviews the neuroevolutionary literature on stress-induced and fear circuitry disorders and related amygdala-driven, species-atypical fear behaviors of clinical severity in adult humans. Over 30 empirically testable/falsifiable predictions are presented. It is noted that in DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10, the classification of stress and fear circuitry disorders is neither mode-of-acquisition-based nor brain-evolution-based. For example, snake phobia (innate) and dog phobia (overconsolidational) are clustered together. Similarly, research on blood-injection-injury-type-specific phobia clusters two fears different in their innateness: 1) an arguably ontogenetic memory-trace-overconsolidation-based fear (hospital phobia) and 2) a hardwired (innate) fear of the sight of one's blood or a sharp object penetrating one's skin. Genetic architecture-charting of fear-circuitry-related traits has been challenging. Various, non-phenotype-based architectures can serve as targets for research. In this article, the author will propose one such alternative genetic architecture. This article was inspired by the following: A) Nesse's "Smoke-Detector Principle", B) the increasing suspicion that the "smooth" rather than "lumpy" distribution of complex psychiatric phenotypes (including fear-circuitry disorders) may in some cases be accounted for by oligogenic (and not necessarily polygenic) transmission, and C) insights from the initial sequence of the chimpanzee genome and comparison with the human genome by the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium published in late 2005. Neuroevolutionary insights relevant to fear circuitry symptoms that primarily emerge overconsolidationally (especially Combat related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) are presented. Also introduced is a human-evolution-based principle for clustering innate fear traits. The "Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle" of innate fears proposed in this article may be useful in the development of a neuroevolution-based taxonomic re-clustering of stress-triggered and fear-circuitry disorders in DSM-V. Four broad clusters of evolved fear circuits are proposed based on their time-depths: 1) Mesozoic (mammalian-wide) circuits hardwired by wild-type alleles driven to fixation by Mesozoic selective sweeps; 2) Cenozoic (simian-wide) circuits relevant to many specific phobias; 3) mid Paleolithic and upper Paleolithic (Homo sapiens-specific) circuits (arguably resulting mostly from mate-choice-driven stabilizing selection); 4) Neolithic circuits (arguably mostly related to stabilizing selection driven by gene-culture co-evolution). More importantly, the author presents evolutionary perspectives on warzone-related PTSD, Combat-Stress Reaction, Combat-related Stress, Operational-Stress, and other deployment-stress-induced symptoms. The Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle presented in this article may help explain the dissimilar stress-resilience levels following different types of acute threat to survival of oneself or one's progency (aka DSM-III and DSM-V PTSD Criterion-A events). PTSD rates following exposure to lethal inter-group violence (combat, warzone exposure or intentionally caused disasters such as terrorism) are usually 5-10 times higher than rates following large-scale natural disasters such as forest fires, floods, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes. The author predicts that both intentionally-caused large-scale bioevent-disasters, as well as natural bioevents such as SARS and avian flu pandemics will be an exception and are likely to be followed by PTSD rates approaching those that follow warzone exposure. During bioevents, Amygdala-driven and locus-coeruleus-driven epidemic pseudosomatic symptoms may be an order of magnitude more common than infection-caused cytokine-driven symptoms. Implications for the red cross and FEMA are discussed. It is also argued that hospital phobia as well as dog phobia, bird phobia and bat phobia require re-taxonomization in DSM-V in a new "overconsolidational disorders" category anchored around PTSD. The overconsolidational spectrum category may be conceptualized as straddling the fear circuitry spectrum disorders and the affective spectrum disorders categories, and may be a category for which Pitman's secondary prevention propranolol regimen may be specifically indicated as a "morning after pill" intervention. Predictions are presented regarding obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (e.g., female-pattern hoarding vs. male-pattern hoarding) and "culture-bound" acute anxiety symptoms (taijin-kyofusho, koro, shuk yang, shook yong, suo yang, rok-joo, jinjinia-bemar, karoshi, gwarosa, Voodoo death). Also discussed are insights relevant to pseudoneurological symptoms and to the forthcoming Dissociative-Conversive disorders category in DSM-V, including what the author terms fright-triggered acute pseudo-localized symptoms (i.e., pseudoparalysis, pseudocerebellar imbalance, psychogenic blindness, pseudoseizures, and epidemic sociogenic illness). Speculations based on studies of the human abnormal-spindle-like, microcephaly-associated (ASPM) gene, the microcephaly primary autosomal recessive (MCPH) gene, and the forkhead box p2 (FOXP2) gene are made and incorporated into what is termed "The pre-FOXP2 Hypothesis of Blood-Injection-Injury Phobia." Finally, the author argues for a non-reductionistic fusion of "distal (evolutionary) neurobiology" with clinical "proximal neurobiology," utilizing neurological heuristics. It is noted that the value of re-clustering fear traits based on behavioral ethology, human-phylogenomics-derived endophenotypes and on ontogenomics (gene-environment interactions) can be confirmed or disconfirmed using epidemiological or twin studies and psychiatric genomics.
30708402<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>The genetic and environmental structure of fear and anxiety in juvenile twins.<<>>Fear and anxiety are conceptualized as responses to acute or potential threat, respectively. Adult twin studies found substantial interplay between genetic and environmental factors influencing fear disorders (phobias) and anxiety disorders. Research in children, however, has largely examined these factors independently. Thus, there exists a substantial knowledge gap regarding the underlying etiologic structure of these closely-related constructs during development. Symptom counts for five fear (criticism, the unknown, death, animal, medical) and four anxiety (generalized, panic, separation, social) dimensions were obtained for 373 twin pairs ages 9-14. Multivariate twin modeling was performed to elucidate the genetic and environmental influences distributed amongst these dimensions. The best fitting model contained one genetic, two familial environmental, and two unique environmental factors shared between fear and anxiety symptoms plus dimension-specific genetic and unique environmental factors. Although several environmental factors were shared between fear and anxiety dimensions, one latent factor accounted for genetic influences across both domains. While adult studies find somewhat distinct etiological differences between anxiety and phobic disorders, the current results suggest that their relative genetic and environmental influences are not as clearly demarcated in children. These etiological distinctions are more nuanced, likely contributing to the highly diffuse symptom patterns seen during development.
23869194<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Cognitive and emotional factors affecting avoidable decision-making delay in acute myocardial infarction male adults.<<>>BACKGROUND: To study the potentially avoidable decision-making delay in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) adults male with different psychological characteristics a nationwide multicentre study was conducted in Italy by the 118 Coronary Care Units (CCUs). METHOD: 929 AMI patients consecutively presented to the CCU in a conscious condition less than two hours, 2-6 hours, 6-12 hours, and more than 12 hours after symptom onset and completing the Disease Distress Questionnaire (DDQ) were enrolled in a multicentre case-control study. The DDQ collects information regarding the decision time to seek help, and includes a set of items assessing psychological factors and pain-related symptoms. The relationship between the perceived threat and the delay due to decision-making was evaluated by means of a multivariate model using LISREL 8 structural equation modelling. RESULTS: The delay significantly correlated with perceived threat, which was mainly related to somatic awareness. It was only slightly related to pain and was not associated with any of the other variables. Perceived threat was also related to psychological upset, fear and health worries, the first of which was considerably influenced by emotional instability. CONCLUSION: Somatic awareness is the main dimension affecting perceived threat, but subjective pain intensity affects the delay both directly and indirectly. The core of the model is the relationship between perceived threat and the delay due to decision-making. The importance of subjective pain intensity is well documented, but it is still not clear how subjective and objective pain interact.
19201093<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>The effect of attentional re-training and threat expectancy in response to acute pain.<<>>This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of implicit attention re-training (AR) on pain ratings, threshold and tolerance during the cold-pressor task and to determine whether the effectiveness of AR was affected by threat expectancy. One hundred and four undergraduate psychology students were randomly assigned to receive either threat-alleviating or threat-inducing information about the task. Participants were then re-randomized to receive an AR that either trained them to implicitly attend to neutral and ignore pain-related stimuli (neutral training) or to attend towards pain-related stimuli (pain training). Hence, the present study had a 2 (threat expectancy: high vs low) x 2 (AR: pain vs neutral) design. Manipulation checks confirmed that the threat manipulation was effective in increasing threat expectancy and the training paradigm shifted attentional biases in predicted directions. Results showed that, relative to neutral re-training, those in the pain re-training group reported higher levels of pain 30s into the cold pressor task and registered pain more quickly. There was no difference in tolerance between the groups, nor pain at tolerance. This was the same pattern of results found for the threat induction. For initial pain ratings, there was an interaction that closely approached significance (p=0.053). These results show that AR affects individual's perceptions of and their responses to pain during an experimental task in a similar way to increasing the threat expectancy of the task. Future research should trial AR in real-life settings to determine whether these results can be generalized.
26319210<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Acute administration of nicotine into the higher order auditory Te2 cortex specifically decreases the fear-related charge of remote emotional memories.<<>>Nicotine elicits several behavioural effects on mood as well as on stress and anxiety processes. Recently, it was found that the higher order components of the sensory cortex, such as the secondary auditory cortex Te2, are essential for the long-term storage of remote fear memories. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the effects of acute nicotine injection into the higher order auditory cortex Te2, on the remote emotional memories of either threat or incentive experiences in rats. We found that intra-Te2 nicotine injection decreased the fear-evoked responses to a tone previously paired with footshock. This effect was cue- and dose-specific and was not due to any interference with auditory stimuli processing, innate anxiety and fear processes, or with motor responses. Nicotine acts acutely in the presence of threat stimuli but it did not determine the permanent degradation of the fear-memory trace, since memories tested one week after nicotine injection were unaffected. Remarkably, nicotine did not affect the memory of a similar tone that was paired to incentive stimuli. We conclude from our results that nicotine, when acting acutely in the auditory cortex, relieves the fear charge embedded by learned stimuli.
22592105<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>The coping process in adults with acute leukemia undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.<<>>BACKGROUND: The increasing numbers of leukemia cancer survivors treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) face numerous challenges after their transplant procedure. Little information has been published regarding the coping process of this population. Understanding how they cope with this life-threatening disease can assist healthcare professionals to provide holistic care. PURPOSE: This study was designed to elicit the coping process of adults experiencing acute leukemia who underwent HSCT therapy. METHODS: This longitudinal qualitative study and grounded theory took place during 2009-2011. Ten adults with acute leukemia scheduled for HSCT were recruited from Shariati Hospital in Tehran, Iran. A series of pretransplant and posttransplant interviews were held in the hospital's HSCT units. Final interviews took place 2-6 months posttransplant in the hospital's outpatient clinic. RESULTS: The five categories that emerged from the data included perceived threat, suspension between fear and hope, rebirth, contextual factors, and coping strategies. Although patients vacillated within the coping spectrum (i.e., the "buffer zone" between fighting and acquiescing), "finding meaning" was identified as the final outcome of their experience that indicated effective coping. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE: Each patient perceives leukemia and HSCT therapy uniquely. This life-threatening disease can significantly affect patient perception and change patient lives both temporarily and permanently. Nurses can apply effective interventions to help patients cope with their unique situation, find meaning and hope, and allay fear and stress.
20797918<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Attentional biases toward sensory pain words in acute and chronic pain patients.<<>>UNLABELLED: Attentional biases towards pain-related words of chronic and acute low back pain (LBP) patients were compared with healthy pain-free controls. Specifically, the aims were to determine: 1) whether chronic LBP patients demonstrate attentional biases compared to pain-free controls; 2) whether observed biases are also present in those with acute LBP; and 3) whether observed biases are associated with pain-related fear among the pain groups. Four groups were recruited: 1) acute LBP patients; 2) chronic LBP patients from physiotherapy practices; 3) chronic LBP patients from a tertiary referral pain-management center; and 4) healthy pain-free controls. Participants were assessed on the dot-probe computer task for attentional bias to pain-related words. All 3 pain groups demonstrated biases compared to controls on sensory but not on affective, disability, or threat words. Among the pain groups, those with low and moderate levels of fear of (re)injury demonstrated biases towards sensory pain words that were absent in those with high levels of fear, which is counterintuitive to what the fear of (re)injury model suggests. These results suggest that the experience of pain, rather than duration, is the primary indicator of the presence of pain-related biases. PERSPECTIVE: Attentional biases are present in chronic and acute pain. Biases towards sensory-pain stimuli were demonstrated regardless of pain duration; however, they were present in those with low and moderate levels of fear of (re)injury only and not those high in fear. These findings are not consistent with the fear of (re)injury model.
26210058<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Frontal Cortex Stimulation Reduces Vigilance to Threat: Implications for the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety.<<>>BACKGROUND: The difficulty in treating mood disorders has brought about clinical interest in alternative treatments, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). However, the optimal parameters for stimulation and underlying mechanisms of action are unclear. Psychiatric treatments have acute effects on emotional processing that predict later therapeutic action. Such effects have been proposed as cognitive biomarkers for screening novel treatments for depression and anxiety. METHODS: This study assessed the effect of tDCS on a battery of emotional processing measures sensitive to antidepressant action. To refine optimal stimulation parameters, DLPFC stimulation using two common electrode montages was compared with sham. Sixty healthy volunteers received 20 minutes of active or sham DLPFC stimulation before completing computerized emotional processing tasks, including a dot-probe measure of vigilance to threat. RESULTS: Relative to sham stimulation, participants receiving simultaneous anodal stimulation of left DLPFC and cathodal stimulation of right DLPFC (bipolar-balanced montage) showed reduced vigilance to threatening stimuli. There was no such significant effect when the cathode was placed on the supraorbital ridge (bipolar-unbalanced montage). There were no effects of tDCS on other measures of emotional processing. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide the first experimental evidence that modulating activity in the DLPFC reduces vigilance to threatening stimuli. This significant reduction in fear vigilance is similar to that seen with anxiolytic treatments in the same cognitive paradigm. The finding that DLPFC tDCS acutely alters the processing of threatening information suggests a potential cognitive mechanism that could underwrite treatment effects in clinical populations.
24813833<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>The effect of cognitive bias modification for interpretation on avoidance of pain during an acute experimental pain task.<<>>Research confirms that patients with chronic pain show a tendency to interpret ambiguous stimuli as pain related. However, whether modifying these interpretive pain biases impacts pain outcomes is unknown. This study aimed to demonstrate that interpretation biases towards pain can be modified, and that changing these biases influences pain outcomes in the cold pressor task. One hundred and six undergraduate students were randomly allocated to receive either threatening or reassuring information regarding the cold pressor. They also were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 conditions in the Ambiguous Scenarios Task, in which they were trained to have either a threatening interpretation of pain (pain bias condition) or a nonthreatening interpretation of pain (no pain bias condition). Therefore, the study had a 2 (threat/reassuring)x2 (pain bias/no pain bias) design. Analyses showed that a bias was induced contingent on condition, and that the threat manipulation was effective. Participants in the pain bias condition hesitated more before doing the cold pressor task than those in the no pain bias condition, as did those in the threat compared with the reassurance condition. The major finding was that interpretive bias mediated the relationship between bias condition and hesitance time, supporting the causal role of interpretive biases for avoidance behaviors in current chronic pain models. No differences were found on other pain outcomes regarding bias or threat, and the efficacy of the bias modification was not impacted by different levels of threat. These results suggest that cognitive bias modification should be further explored as a potential intervention in pain.
30379643<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Interpretation bias in the face of pain: a discriminatory fear conditioning approach.<<>>Background and aims Interpreting pain- and illness-related stimuli as health-threatening is common among chronic pain patients but also occurs in the general population. As interpretation bias (IB) may affect pain perception and might even play part in the development and maintenance of chronic pain, it is important to improve our understanding of this concept. Several studies suggest an association between IB and pain-related anxiety. However, those studies often rely on verbal and pictorial IB tasks that do not entail a threat of actual pain, therefore lacking personal relevance for healthy participants. The current study investigated whether healthy individuals show an IB towards ambiguous health-related stimuli in a context of actual pain threat, and explored whether this bias is associated to pain anxiety constructs. Methods Thirty-six healthy participants were conditioned to expect painful electrocutaneous shocks (unconditioned stimulus - US) after health-threat words (CS+) but not after neutral (non-health-threat) words (CS-) in order to establish fear of pain. Subsequently, they completed a verbal interpretation task that contained new CS+ and CS- stimuli as well as ambiguous non-reinforced health-threat and non-health-threat words. IB was assessed through shock expectancy ratings and startle responses to ambiguous and evident health threatening or neutral word stimuli. Pain-related anxiety was measured with validated questionnaires. Results The results show a general IB towards ambiguous health-related words on pain expectancies but not on startle response. An exploratory analysis suggests that this effect exists irrespective of pain-related anxiety levels which however may be due to a lack of power. Conclusion We present a novel experimental paradigm employing actual health threat that captures IB towards health-related stimuli in healthy individuals. Taken together, results provide evidence for the further consideration of IB as a latent vulnerability factor in the onset and maintenance of pain chronicity. In contrast to previous studies employing a safe, pain-free context, we found that healthy participants show an IB towards ambiguous health-related stimuli, when confronted with pain threat. Implications Like chronic pain patients, healthy individuals display an IB towards health-threat stimuli when these stimuli become personally relevant by carrying information about pending health threat. Therefore, the presented paradigm could be valuable for pain-related cognitive bias research in healthy participants as it may have a higher ecological validity than previous study designs. Future studies will have to elucidate the influence of anxiety constructs on IB in larger samples.
21626478<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>[Surviving the initial phase: subjective theories of illness in patients suffering from acute leukaemia at the end of initial inpatient treatment].<<>>OBJECTIVES: Studies concentrating on the temporal dependence of subjective concepts during oncological treatment are underrepresented. Subjective interpretation contexts develop in the course of illness. The study focuses on the ideal-typical gestalt of these contents. METHODS: In a follow-up study on coping, 12 patients with acute leukaemia (AL) were interviewed using a semistructured interview at the end of initial inpatient treatment. Using qualitative methodology, we inductively developed categories and assigned them to formal main categories. RESULTS: The following categories were developed: causal uncertainty as burden; discrepancy between subjective and objective assessment of degree of threat; knowledge of disease: conflict between information-seeking and information-avoiding behavior; dominance of medical approach to treatment; pursuit of normality; defense of emotions; orientation to workflows on the ward; adjustment as a coping strategy; positive attitude as a resource; life between hope and fear; limited future; latent fear of death. CONCLUSION: Themes of coping with the disease become visible. Some of these contents are tacit and latent, although of high subjective relevance to the patient. Their consideration could improve the patient-physician relationship.
21733208<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Perceptual processing advantages for trauma-related visual cues in post-traumatic stress disorder.<<>>BACKGROUND: Intrusive re-experiencing in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) comprises distressing sensory impressions from the trauma that seem to occur 'out of the blue'. A key question is how intrusions are triggered. One possibility is that PTSD is characterized by a processing advantage for stimuli that resemble those that accompanied the trauma, which would lead to increased detection of such cues in the environment. METHOD: We used a blurred picture identification task in a cross-sectional (n=99) and a prospective study (n=221) of trauma survivors. RESULTS: Participants with acute stress disorder (ASD) or PTSD, but not trauma survivors without these disorders, identified trauma-related pictures, but not general threat pictures, better than neutral pictures. There were no group differences in the rate of trauma-related answers to other picture categories. The relative processing advantage for trauma-related pictures correlated with re-experiencing and dissociation, and predicted PTSD at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: A perceptual processing bias for trauma-related stimuli may contribute to the involuntary triggering of intrusive trauma memories in PTSD.
23922655<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Defensive aggregation (huddling) in Rattus norvegicus toward predator odor: individual differences, social buffering effects and neural correlates.<<>>Aggregation is a defensive strategy employed by many prey species in response to predatory threat. Our group has characterized defensive aggregation (huddling) in Rattus norvegicus in response to a ball of cat fur. In this situation some rats huddle less, and approach the threatening cue more than others (active vs. passive responders). The present study explored whether active responding is a stable phenotype associated with behaviors outside direct predatory encounters. The neural substrates of active and passive responding under predatory threat were explored using c-Fos immunohistochemistry. Finally, we examined whether the presence of conspecifics during predatory threat biases behavior towards active responding. Active and passive responding styles were found to be stable in individual rats across consecutive group exposures to cat fur, and were predicted by anxiety-like behavior in an open-field emergence test. Active responders displayed less conditioned fear in an environment associated with predatory threat, and had higher post-exposure intake of a weak sucrose solution (a test of "anhedonia"). Active responding was associated with: greater cat fur-induced activation of the accessory olfactory bulb, reflecting greater olfactory stimulation in rats actively approaching the fur; lowered activation of somatosensory cortex, reflecting reduced huddling with conspecifics; and reduced activation in the lateral septum. Social exposure to cat fur promoted active responding relative to individual exposure, and lowered c-Fos expression in the dorsomedial periaqueductal grey, medial caudate putamen and lateral habenula. We conclude that individual differences in anti-predator behavior appear stable traits with active responders having a more resilient phenotype. Social exposure to predatory threat has an acute buffering effect, subtly changing the neural and behavioral response towards threat and encouraging active responding. An association between active responding and lower c-Fos expression in the lateral septum is consistent with previous studies that highlight this region as an important neurobiological substrate of defensive aggregation.
28390494<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Generalization of Pain-Related Fear Based on Conceptual Knowledge.<<>>Increasing evidence suggests that pain-related fear is key to the transition from acute to chronic pain. Previous research has shown that perceptual similarity with a pain-associated movement fosters the generalization of fear to novel movements. Perceptual generalization of pain-related fear is adaptive as it enables individuals to extrapolate the threat value of one movement to another without the necessity to learn anew. However, excessive spreading of fear to safe movements may become maladaptive and may lead to sustained anxiety, dysfunctional avoidance behaviors, and severe disability. A hallmark of human cognition is the ability to extract conceptual knowledge from a learning episode as well. Although this conceptual pathway may be important to understand fear generalization in chronic pain, research on this topic is lacking. We investigated acquisition and generalization of concept-based pain-related fear. During acquisition, unique exemplars of one action category (CS+; e.g., opening boxes) were followed by pain, whereas exemplars of another action category (CS-; e.g., closing boxes) were not. Subsequently, spreading of pain-related fear to novel exemplars of both action categories was tested. Participants learned to expect the pain to occur and reported more pain-related fear to the exemplars of the CS+ category compared with those of the CS- category. During generalization, fear and expectancy generalized to novel exemplars of the CS+ category, but not to the CS- category. This pattern was not corroborated in the eyeblink startle measures. This is the first study that demonstrates that pain-related fear can be acquired and generalized based on conceptual knowledge.
25530986<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>The influence of acute stress on the regulation of conditioned fear.<<>>Fear learning and regulation is a prominent model for describing the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders and stress-related psychopathology. Fear expression can be modulated using a number of regulatory strategies, including extinction, cognitive emotion regulation, avoidance strategies and reconsolidation. In this review, we examine research investigating the effects of acute stress and stress hormones on these regulatory techniques. We focus on what is known about the impact of stress on the ability to flexibly regulate fear responses that are acquired through Pavlovian fear conditioning. Our primary aim is to explore the impact of stress on fear regulation in humans. Given this, we focus on techniques where stress has been linked to alterations of fear regulation in humans (extinction and emotion regulation), and briefly discuss other techniques (avoidance and reconsolidation) where the impact of stress or stress hormones have been mainly explored in animal models. These investigations reveal that acute stress may impair the persistent inhibition of fear, presumably by altering prefrontal cortex function. Characterizing the effects of stress on fear regulation is critical for understanding the boundaries within which existing regulation strategies are viable in everyday life and can better inform treatment options for those who suffer from anxiety and stress-related psychopathology.
29779574<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Cardiac-disease-induced PTSD and Fear of illness progression: Capturing the unique nature of disease-related PTSD.<<>>According to Edmondson's Enduring Somatic Threat (EST) Model of PTSD Due to Acute Life-Threatening Medical Events, the nature of PTSD in the context of illness may differ from the nature of "traditional" PTSD in that it includes future-oriented alongside past-related intrusive thoughts. Yet almost no empirical studies to date have assessed the putative future-oriented quality of cardiac-disease-induced PTSD (CDI-PTSD). In the current study, we assessed the hypothesized associations between CDI-PTSD and fear of illness progression (FoP) - a novel theoretical conceptualization of patients' future-related anxieties. We hypothesized that FoP would be positively associated with CDI-PTSD, and especially with its specific items of intrusive thoughts. Patients (N=112) were interviewed three months post-hospitalization for an acute coronary event via use of the PSS-SR-5 (to assess PTSD symptomatology), the FoP-Q-SF (to assess fear of illness progression), and the HADS (to assess anxiety and depression levels). Results indicated a strong positive association between CDI-PTSD and FoP, even when controlling for anxiety and depression. As hypothesized, the concepts of CDI-PTSD and fear of illness progression were strongly associated both at the level of the clusters as well as at the level of the specific items. The current study provides an initial empirical validation of the EST Model, especially regarding the future-oriented nature of PTSD resulting from acute cardiovascular disease.
28838469<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>The Unpredictive Brain Under Threat: A Neurocomputational Account of Anxious Hypervigilance.<<>>BACKGROUND: Anxious hypervigilance is marked by sensitized sensory-perceptual processes and attentional biases to potential danger cues in the environment. How this is realized at the neurocomputational level is unknown but could clarify the brain mechanisms disrupted in psychiatric conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder. Predictive coding, instantiated by dynamic causal models, provides a promising framework to ground these state-related changes in the dynamic interactions of reciprocally connected brain areas. METHODS: Anxiety states were elicited in healthy participants (n = 19) by exposure to the threat of unpredictable, aversive shocks while undergoing magnetoencephalography. An auditory oddball sequence was presented to measure cortical responses related to deviance detection, and dynamic causal models quantified deviance-related changes in effective connectivity. Participants were also administered alprazolam (double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover) to determine whether the cortical effects of threat-induced anxiety are reversed by acute anxiolytic treatment. RESULTS: Deviant tones elicited increased auditory cortical responses under threat. Bayesian analyses revealed that hypervigilant responding was best explained by increased postsynaptic gain in primary auditory cortex activity as well as modulation of feedforward, but not feedback, coupling within a temporofrontal cortical network. Increasing inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acidergic action with alprazolam reduced anxiety and restored feedback modulation within the network. CONCLUSIONS: Threat-induced anxiety produced unbalanced feedforward signaling in response to deviations in predicable sensory input. Amplifying ascending sensory prediction error signals may optimize stimulus detection in the face of impending threats. At the same time, diminished descending sensory prediction signals impede perceptual learning and may, therefore, underpin some of the deleterious effects of anxiety on higher-order cognition.
27634145<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>The neural circuits of innate fear: detection, integration, action, and memorization.<<>>How fear is represented in the brain has generated a lot of research attention, not only because fear increases the chances for survival when appropriately expressed but also because it can lead to anxiety and stress-related disorders when inadequately processed. In this review, we summarize recent progress in the understanding of the neural circuits processing innate fear in rodents. We propose that these circuits are contained within three main functional units in the brain: a detection unit, responsible for gathering sensory information signaling the presence of a threat; an integration unit, responsible for incorporating the various sensory information and recruiting downstream effectors; and an output unit, in charge of initiating appropriate bodily and behavioral responses to the threatful stimulus. In parallel, the experience of innate fear also instructs a learning process leading to the memorization of the fearful event. Interestingly, while the detection, integration, and output units processing acute fear responses to different threats tend to be harbored in distinct brain circuits, memory encoding of these threats seems to rely on a shared learning system.
25448265<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Aversive startle potentiation and fear pathology: Mediating role of threat sensitivity and moderating impact of depression.<<>>Enhanced startle reactivity during exposure to unpleasant cues (aversive startle potentiation; ASP) appears in the RDoC matrix as a physiological index of acute threat response. Increased ASP has been linked to focal fear disorders and to scale measures of dispositional fearfulness (i.e., threat sensitivity; THT+). However, some studies have reported reduced ASP for fear pathology accompanied by major depressive disorder (MDD) or pervasive distress. The current study evaluated whether (a) THT+ as indexed by reported dispositional fearfulness mediates the relationship between fear disorders (when unaccompanied by depression) and ASP, and (b) depression moderates relations of THT+ and fear disorders with ASP. Fear disorder participants without MDD showed enhanced ASP whereas those with MDD (or other distress conditions) showed evidence of reduced ASP. Continuous THT+ scores also predicted ASP, and this association: (a) was likewise moderated by depression/distress, and (b) accounted for the relationship between ASP and fear pathology without MDD. These findings point to a role for the RDoC construct of acute threat, operationalized dispositionally, in enhanced ASP shown by individuals with fear pathology unaccompanied by distress pathology.
25811262<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Easy to Harm, Hard to Heal: Patient Views About the Back.<<>>STUDY DESIGN: Qualitative interview study. OBJECTIVE: Explore attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions related to low back pain (LBP) and analyze how these might influence the perceived threat associated with back pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Psychological factors that contribute to the perceived threat associated with LBP play an important role in back pain development and the progression to persistent pain and disability. Improved understanding of underlying beliefs may assist clinicians to investigate and assess these factors. METHODS: Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with 12 participants with acute LBP (<6-wk duration) and 11 participants with chronic LBP (>3 mo duration). Data were analyzed thematically using the framework of Interpretive Description. RESULTS: The back was viewed as being vulnerable to injury due to its design, the way in which it is used, and personal physical traits or previous injury. Consequently, participants considered that they needed to protect their back by resting, being careful with or avoiding dangerous activities, and strengthening muscles or controlling posture. Participants considered LBP to be special in its nature and impact, and they thought it difficult to understand without personal experience. The prognosis of LBP was considered uncertain by those with acute pain and poor by those with chronic pain. These beliefs combined to create a negative (mis)representation of the back. CONCLUSION: Negative assumptions about the back made by those with LBP may affect information processing during an episode of pain. This may result in attentional bias toward information indicating that the spine is vulnerable, an injury is serious, or the outcome will be poor. Approaching consultations with this understanding may assist clinicians to have a positive influence on beliefs. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.
27280966<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Functional domains as correlates of suicidality among psychiatric inpatients.<<>>BACKGROUND: Suicide remains poorly understood and unpredictable. Addressing this challenge, this study examined the independent contributions of several research domain criteria (RDoC) constructs in relation to suicidality in patients hospitalized for acute suicide risk. Specifically, we examined anhedonia, anxiety/entrapment, and attachment disturbances, reflecting disturbances in reward processes, negative valence systems, and social processes, respectively. METHODS: Anhedonia, anxiety, entrapment, and fearful attachment, were assessed quantitatively in 135 adults hospitalized for suicidality. Current suicidality and suicidal history were assessed with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Bivariate analyses (with significance threshold of p<.01 to account for multiple comparisons) and multivariate models examined relationships between symptom dimensions and severity of suicidal ideation (SI). We also assessed differences between patients with a history of suicide attempt and those who exhibited only suicidal ideations. RESULTS: Using bivariate analyses all symptoms except for fearful attachment correlated robustly with SI (r =.37-0.50, p<.001). However, when using multivariate analyses, only anhedonia (beta=.28, p=.01) and entrapment (beta=.19, p=.03) were independently associated with SI across the entire sample. No functional domain measures differed between patients with history of suicide attempt versus ideation only. LIMITATIONS: The reliance on self-report data and a cross-sectional design. CONCLUSIONS: Disturbances in reward and threat processing may represent independent factors in the development of suicidal ideation in this high suicide risk cohort. Future studies should assess their role as risk factors.
24920956<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>An Enduring Somatic Threat Model of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Due to Acute Life-Threatening Medical Events.<<>>Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs in 12-25% of survivors of acute life-threatening medical events such as heart attack, stroke, and cancer, and is associated with recurrence of cardiac events and mortality in heart attack survivors. This article reviews the current state of knowledge about PTSD after such events, and proposes an Enduring Somatic Threat (EST) model of PTSD due to acute life-threatening medical events to address underappreciated differences between PTSD due to past, discrete/external traumatic events (such as combat) and PTSD due to acute manifestations of chronic disease that are enduring/internal in nature (such as heart attack and stroke). The differences include the external versus internal/somatic source of the threat, the past versus present/future temporal focus of threatening cognitions, the different types and consequences of avoidance behavior, and the different character and consequences of hyperarousal. Although important differences between the two types of PTSD exist, the EST model proposes that the underlying fear of mortality maintains PTSD symptoms due to both discrete/external and ongoing/somatic events. Finally, this article offers a research agenda for testing the EST model, with a particular focus on areas that may improve cardiovascular prognosis and health behaviors in survivors of heart attack and stroke.
26370206<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Ebola Preparedness Planning and Collaboration by Two Health Systems in Wisconsin, September to December 2014.<<>>We describe the collaborative approach used by 2 health systems in Wisconsin to plan and prepare for the threat of Ebola virus disease. This was a descriptive study of the preparedness planning, infection prevention, and collaboration with public health agencies undertaken by 2 health systems in Wisconsin between September and December 2014. The preparedness approach used by the 2 health systems relied successfully on their robust infrastructure for planning and infection prevention. In the setting of rapidly evolving guidance and unprecedented fear regarding Ebola, the 2 health systems enhanced their response through collaboration and coordination with each other and government public health agencies. Key lessons learned included the importance of a rigorous planning process, robust infection prevention practices, and coalitions between public and private health sectors. The potential threat of Ebola virus disease stimulated emergency preparedness in which acute care facilities played a leading role in the public health response. Leveraging the existing expertise of health systems is essential when faced with emerging infectious diseases. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2016;10:691-697).
29110718<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Cardiac patients' perceptions of neighboring patients' risk: influence on psychological stress in the ED and subsequent posttraumatic stress.<<>>BACKGROUND: As many as 12% of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients screen positive for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms due to their cardiac event, and emergency department (ED) factors such as overcrowding have been associated with risk for PTSD. We tested the association of patients' perceptions of their proximity to a critically ill patient during ED evaluation for ACS with development of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PSS) in the month after hospital discharge. METHODS: Participants were enrolled in the REactions to Acute Care and Hospitalization (REACH) study during evaluation for ACS in an urban ED. Participants reported whether they perceived a patient near them was close to death. They also reported their current fear, concern they may die, perceived control, and feelings of vulnerability on an Emergency Room Perceptions questionnaire. One month later, participants reported on PTSD symptoms specific to the cardiac event and ED hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 763 participants, 12% reported perceiving a nearby patient was likely to die. In a multivariate linear regression model [F(9757) = 19.69, p < .001, R(2) adjusted = .18] with adjustment for age, sex, GRACE cardiac risk score, discharge ACS diagnosis, Charlson comorbidity index, objective ED crowding, and depression symptoms at baseline, perception of a nearby patients' likely death was associated with a 2.33 point (95% CI, 0.60-4.61) increase in 1 month PTSD score. A post hoc mediation analysis with personal threat perceptions [F(10,756) = 25.28, p < .001, R(2) adjusted = .24] showed increased personal threat perceptions during the ED visit, B = 0.71 points on the PCL per point on the personal threat perception questionnaire, beta = 0.27, p = .001, fully mediated association of participants' perceptions of nearby patients' likely death with 1-month PTSD score (after adjustment for ED threat perceptions,) B = 0.89 (95% CI, -1.33 to 3.12), beta = 0.03, p = .43, accounting for 62% of the adjusted effect and causing the main effect to become statistically nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS: We found patients who perceived a nearby patient was likely to die had significantly greater PTSD symptoms at 1 month. Awareness of this association may be helpful for designing ED patient management procedures to identify and treat patients with an eye to post-ACS psychological care.
27789871<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Underreporting of Musculoskeletal Injuries in the US Army: Findings From an Infantry Brigade Combat Team Survey Study.<<>>BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal injury is a significant threat to readiness in the US Army. Current injury surveillance methods are constrained by accurate injury reporting. Input into electronic medical records or databases therefore may not accurately reflect injury incidence. The purpose of this study was to evaluate injury reporting among active-duty US Army soldiers to explore potential limitations of surveillance approaches. HYPOTHESIS: A significant number of injuries go unreported to medical personnel. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4. METHODS: Surveys were completed by soldiers assigned to an Army Infantry Brigade Combat Team. Survey questions inquired about injuries sustained in the previous 12 months, injury onset, and whether injuries were reported to a medical provider. Participants were asked to rank reasons for accurately reporting, underreporting, and/or exaggerating injuries. Chi-square analyses were used to compare differences among underreported injuries in terms of injury onset (gradual vs acute) and sex. RESULTS: A total of 1388 soldiers reported 3202 injuries that had occurred in the previous 12-month period, including 1636 (51%) that were reported and 1566 (49%) that were identified as not reported to medical personnel. More than 49% of reported injuries were described as acute and 51% were described as chronic. Injury exaggeration was reported by 6% of soldiers. The most common reasons for not reporting injuries were fear that an injury might affect future career opportunities and avoidance of military "profiles" (mandated physical restrictions). CONCLUSION: Approximately half of musculoskeletal injuries in a Brigade Combat Team were not reported. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Unreported and untreated injuries can lead to reinjury, chronic pain, performance decrements, and increased costs associated with disability benefits. Additionally, unreported injuries can undermine injury surveillance efforts aimed at reducing the musculoskeletal injury problem in the military.
17131301<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Factors influencing Hong Kong Chinese patients' decision-making in seeking early treatment for acute myocardial infarction.<<>>The purpose of this study was to identify, through in-depth interview, factors that influenced 27 Hong Kong Chinese patients' decision-making in seeking early treatment for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The median delay time from the onset of symptoms to arrival at the hospital was 15.6 hours for men and 53.7 hours for women. Three major categories emerged from the data: (a) becoming aware of the threat, (b) maintaining a sense of normality, and (c) struggling to mobilize resources. A variety of decisions were made by patients from the onset of chest pain to seeking help. These decisions were heavily influenced by healthcare factors (access to emergency medical service (EMS) and treatment), personal factors (cognitive interpretations of symptoms), sociocultural factors (family situation, cultural beliefs, and practices), and coping strategies.
16458356<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Facing mortality: a qualitative in-depth interview study on illness perception, lay theories and coping strategies of adult patients with acute leukemia 1 week after diagnosis.<<>>In patients with acute leukemia we investigated the illness perceptions, lay theories and coping strategies 1 week after diagnosis. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 12 patients. The transcribed interviews were analyzed by methods of qualitative research. Dramatic narrations of overwhelming threat in younger patients contrast to rationalization in elderly patients. Feelings of helplessness and efforts of normalization become apparent. Intense descriptions of physical injury due to invasive procedures allow verbalizing the fear of the disease. While coping strategies are complex, the overall importance of trust is recognized. Mortal fears are indirectly indicated. The results have consequences for psycho-oncological training and patient education.
17156152<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Panic comorbidity with bipolar disorder: what is the manic-panic connection?<<>>CONTEXT: Bipolar/panic comorbidity has been observed in clinical, community and familial samples. As both are episodic disorders of affect regulation, the common pathophysiological mechanism is likely to involve deficits in amygdala-mediated, plasticity-dependent emotional conditioning. EVIDENCE: Neuronal genesis and synaptic remodeling occur in the amygdala; bipolar and panic disorders have both been associated with abnormality in the amygdala and related structures, as well as in molecules that modulate plasticity, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF). These biological elements are involved in behavioral conditioning to threat and reward. MODEL: Panic attacks resemble the normal acute fear response, but are abnormally dissociated from any relevant threat. Abnormal reward-seeking behavior is central to both manic and depressive syndromes. Appetites can be elevated or depressed; satisfaction of a drive may fail to condition future behavior. These dissociations may be the result of deficits in plasticity-dependent processes of conditioning within different amygdala subregions. CONCLUSIONS: This speculative model may be a useful framework with which to connect molecular, cellular, anatomic and behavioral processes in panic and bipolar disorders. The primary clinical implication is that behavioral treatment may be critical to restore function in some bipolar patients who respond only partially to medications.
21251795<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Facial affect processing in patients receiving opioid treatment in palliative care: preferential processing of threat in pain catastrophizers.<<>>CONTEXT: As a multidimensional phenomenon, pain is influenced by various psychological factors. One such factor is catastrophizing, which is associated with higher pain intensity and emotional distress in cancer and noncancer pain. One possibility is that catastrophizing represents a general cognitive style that preferentially supports the processing of negative affective stimuli. Such preferential processing of threat--toward negative facial expressions, for example--is seen in emotional disorders and is sensitive to pharmacological treatment. Whether pharmacological (analgesic) treatment might also influence the processing of threat in pain patients is currently unclear. OBJECTIVES: This study investigates the effects catastrophizing on processing of facial affect in those receiving an acute opioid dose. METHODS: In a double-blind crossover design, the performance of 20 palliative care patients after their usual dose of immediate-release opioid was compared with their performance following matched-placebo administration on a facial affect recognition (i.e., speed and accuracy) and threat-pain estimation task (i.e., ratings of pain intensity). The influence of catastrophizing was examined by splitting the sample according to their score on the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS). RESULTS: Opioid administration had no effect on facial affect processing compared with placebo. However, the main finding was that enhanced processing of fear, sadness, and disgust was found only in patients who scored highly on the PCS. There was no difference in performance between the two PCS groups on the other emotions (i.e., happiness, surprise, and anger). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that catastrophizing is associated with an affective information-processing bias in patients with severe pain conditions.
26270268<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Living Under the Constant Threat of Ebola: A Phenomenological Study of Survivors and Family Caregivers During an Ebola Outbreak.<<>>BACKGROUND: Ebola is a highly infectious disease that is caused by viruses of the family Filoviridae and transmitted to humans by direct contact with animals infected from unknown natural reservoirs. Ebola virus infection induces acute fever and death within a few days in up to 90% of symptomatic individuals, causing widespread fear, panic, and antisocial behavior. Uganda is vulnerable to future Ebola outbreaks. Therefore, the survivors of Ebola and their family caregivers are likely to continue experiencing related antisocial overtones, leading to negative health outcomes. PURPOSE: This study articulated the lived experiences of survivors and their family caregivers after an Ebola outbreak in Kibale District, Western Uganda. Eliciting a deeper understanding of these devastating lifetime experiences provides opportunities for developing and implementing more compassionate and competent nursing care for affected persons. METHODS: Ebola survivors and their family caregivers were recruited using a purposive sampling method. Twelve (12) adult survivors and their family caregivers were recruited and were interviewed individually between May and July 2013 in Kibale, a rural district in Western Uganda close to the border of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where Ebola virus was first discovered in 1976. Oral and written informed consent was obtained before all in-depth interviews, and the researchers adhered to principles of anonymity and confidentiality. The interviews were recorded digitally, and data analysis employed Wertz's Empirical Psychological Reflection method, which is grounded in descriptive phenomenology. RESULTS: Living under the constant threat of Ebola is experienced through two main categories: (a) defining features of the experience and (b) responding to the traumatizing experience. Five themes emerged in the first category: (a) fear, ostracism, and stigmatization; (b) annihilation of sufferer's actualities and possibilities; (c) the lingering nature of the traumatic experience; (d) psychosomatic manifestations; and (e) the inescapable nature of the experience. The second category was composed of two themes: (a) seeking self-preservation and protection and (b) transcending victimhood and becoming empowered. CONCLUSIONS: Living under the constant threat of Ebola is experienced as distressing in the physical, social, and psychological realms. In the future, prompt treatment and nursing care are recommended to minimize deaths and to reduce the widespread terror, anxiety, ostracism, and stigmatization that affected individuals and families face. Furthermore, it is recommended that the resilience of survivors and caregivers be increased to facilitate their better coping with the rampant antisocial overtones that they are likely to experience because of their association with Ebola.
24100470<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Posttraumatic stress following pediatric injury: update on diagnosis, risk factors, and intervention.<<>>After pediatric injury, transient traumatic stress reactions are common, and about 1 in 6 children and their parents develop persistent posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms that are linked to poorer physical and functional recovery. Meta-analytic studies identify risk factors for persistent PTS, including preinjury psychological problems, peritrauma fear and perceived life threat, and posttrauma factors such as low social support, maladaptive coping strategies, and parent PTS symptoms. There is growing prospective data indicating that children's subjective appraisals of the injury and its aftermath influence PTS development. Secondary prevention of injury-related PTS often involves parents and focuses on promoting adaptive child appraisals and coping strategies. Web-based psychoeducation and targeted brief early intervention for injured children and their parents have shown a modest effect, but additional research is needed to refine preventive approaches. There is a strong evidence base for effective psychological treatment of severe and persistent PTS via trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy; evidence is lacking for psychopharmacological treatment. Pediatric clinicians play a key role in preventing injury-related PTS by providing "trauma-informed" pediatric care (ie, recognizing preexisting trauma, addressing acute traumatic stress reactions associated with the injury event, minimizing potentially traumatic aspects of treatment, and identifying children who need additional monitoring or referral).
19652680<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Psychosocial impacts of quarantine during disease outbreaks and interventions that may help to relieve strain.<<>>The threat of outbreak of infectious disease such as non-seasonal influenza A (H1N1), commonly referred to as Swine Flu, can provoke the implementation of public health control measures such as quarantine. This paper summarises the psychosocial consequences that may follow for patients and health care and other front-line workers when using quarantine controls. Those affected by quarantine are likely to report distress due to fear and risk perceptions. This distress can be amplified in the face of unclear information and communication that is common in the initial period of disease outbreaks. This paper outlines recommendations for care of those in quarantine and those working with them, such as helping to identify stressors and normalising their impact as much as possible. This should take place at all levels of response, from public information and communication messages to individual face-to-face advice and support.
27837570<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>The importance of the patients deemed not guilty by reason of insanity for the psychiatric reform.<<>>According to the Greek Penal Law if someone "because of a morbid disturbance of his mental functioning" (article 34) is acquitted of a crime or misdemeanour that the law punishes with more than 6 months imprisonment, then the court orders that this individual should be kept in a public psychiatric institution if the court reaches the conclusion that this person poses a threat to public safety.1 Individuals who have broken the law and deemed "not guilty by reason of insanity" are treated in psychiatric units of Psychiatric Hospitals according to the article 69 of the Penal Code. In Athens, in the Psychiatric Hospital of Athens and the Dromokaiteion Psychiatric Hospital, and in Thessaloniki in the Unit for "Not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI)". The person who is deemed not guilty by reason of insanity following a crime is facing double stigmatisation and marginalisation from both the legal and the health system. He/she is usually treated initially with fear and later since there is no therapeutic aim but only the court instruction for "guardianship", with indifference. The patient who is committed by the courts in a psychiatric unit for being "NGRI" is facing a unique legal and psychiatric status.2 In this respect he/she is disadvantaged when compared to either convicted criminals or psychiatric inpatients. If the patient was not found "NGRI" (ie innocent as far as sentencing is concerned) he would have been punished with loss of liberty for a certain (specific) amount of time, and like all individuals convicted in court he/she would have the right to appeal and reduce his/her sentence in a higher court and maybe released from prison earlier for good behaviour etc. In this respect the individual found to be "NGRI" is disadvantaged when compared to a convicted felon since he/she is kept for an undefined period of time. Additionally, he/she will be allowed to leave the psychiatric unit following a subjective assessment of a judge with no psychiatric knowledge who will decide that this certain individual has "ceased to be dangerous". These problems are accentuated by the difficulties that the Greek justice system is facing. On the other side, from the psychiatric point of view, the "NGRI" patient who is an inpatient is not receiving the holistic, (bio psycho social) treatment and assessment of needs he/she requires. The psychiatric team looking after him, once the acute symptomatology is controlled is just getting used to a patient who will not be discharged in the immediate future. These patients form the "new chronic asylum psychiatric inpatients" for whom the treating psychiatrists are not allowed to discharge back into the community whilst it is unclear whether they can be transferred to supported rehabilitation units. It is a medical but also legal paradox to assign to contemporary psychiatric units aiming mainly to treat patients in the community to "keep and guard" inpatients whilst these psychiatric units should focus on care and rehabilitation of the patients (including the "NGRIs").3 Keeping patients like these in psychiatric units creates problems in the functioning of the units. These patients are "kept" in acute beds for long periods of time (5 to 6 years minimum) with patients treated voluntarily or against their will and cannot be discharged without a court's decision. The problems are obvious if one realises that the average time of hospitalisation is not exceeding 2 months for the vast majority of psychiatric patients. With the prolonged stay patients of the "article 69" (NGRIs) they not only burden the already limited resources (there is an established lack of psychiatric beds nationwide) but also this prolonged hospitalisation increases their stigmatisation and marginalisation. Thus the prolonged hospitalisation for "safety" reasons according to the court decision leads to the absence of a therapeutic aim other than maintaining the patient on the ward. Greece has agreed that there is an urgent need in developing community psychiatry services and closure/transformation of the big psychiatric hospitals (asylums). It is impossible to close hospitals where "NGRIs" are kept. The decision to move them into the community is not a medical-psychiatric but a legal one. In this respect it is imperative to establish a Forensic Psychiatric Unit for these patients. In our country as the "Psychargos" external evaluation highlighted, there are great gaps in the provision of Forensic psychiatric services.3 It must be emphasised that these gaps affect negatively psychiatric reform and social reintegration not only for the forensic psychiatric patients but for the whole of mentally ill individuals. Given that forensic Psychiatric services are developed in Athens and Thessaloniki and that training in Forensic Psychiatry has moved forward, it is imperative that the state should build upon the existing knowledge and experience and create specialist forensic units aiming to treat and rehabilitate this special and important group of patients.4 Only when the patients found "not guilty by reasons of insanity" have their own (safe for the society and them) therapeutic and rehabilitative services the aim of de-institutionalisation will be visible and realistic to implement.
26981581<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>White Matter Abnormalities in Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Following a Specific Traumatic Event.<<>>Studies of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are complicated by wide variability in the intensity and duration of prior stressors in patient participants, secondary effects of chronic psychiatric illness, and a variable history of treatment with psychiatric medications. In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, patient samples have often been small, and they were not often compared to similarly stressed patients without PTSD in order to control for general stress effects. Findings from these studies have been inconsistent. The present study investigated whole-brain microstructural alterations of white matter in a large drug-naive population who survived a specific, severe traumatic event (a major 8.0-magnitude earthquake). Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we explored group differences between 88 PTSD patients and 91 matched traumatized non-PTSD controls in fractional anisotropy (FA), as well as its component elements axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD), and examined these findings in relation to findings from deterministic DTI tractography. Relations between white matter alterations and psychiatric symptom severity were examined. PTSD patients, relative to similarly stressed controls, showed an FA increase as well as AD and RD changes in the white matter beneath left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and forceps major. The observation of increased FA in the PTSD group suggests that the pathophysiology of PTSD after a specific acute traumatic event is distinct from what has been reported in patients with several years duration of illness. Alterations in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may be an important aspect of illness pathophysiology, possibly via the region's established role in fear extinction circuitry. Use-dependent myelination or other secondary compensatory changes in response to heightened demands for threat appraisal and emotion regulation may be involved.
24813436<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Dirt and disgust as key drivers in nurses' infection control behaviours: an interpretative, qualitative study.<<>>BACKGROUND: Infection prevention remains a significant challenge for healthcare systems. Yet despite considerable work to provide clear policies and scientifically proven techniques to reduce infection transmission, beliefs and practices of healthcare workers do not always concur with scientific rationale. AIM: To provide explanations for nurses' infection prevention behaviours. METHODS: An interpretative, qualitative approach was taken using semi-structured interviews. Twenty interviews with registered nurses working in an acute hospital setting were conducted. Analysis was conducted using the Framework method. FINDINGS: This paper focuses on the theme 'protection from dirt'. Within the findings clear distinction was made between infection and dirt. Fear of contact with dirt, particularly dirt belonging to those who were unknown, was a key driver in behaviour carried out to reduce threat. Familiarity with the patient resulted in a reduction of the protective behaviours required. These behaviours, which initially appeared as part of an infection prevention strategy, were primarily a form of self-protection from patients, who at first encounter were considered as dirty. CONCLUSION: Behaviours do not always fit with a rational response to infection, but instead may be responses to dirt. Any programme that simply attempts to address scientific knowledge and behaviour deficits is unlikely to have the desired goals if it does not take into account existing social constructions of dirt and the response it evokes.
12600704<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>The Mouse Defense Test Battery: pharmacological and behavioral assays for anxiety and panic.<<>>The Mouse Defense Test Battery was developed from tests of defensive behaviors in rats, reflecting earlier studies of both acute and chronic responses of laboratory and wild rodents to threatening stimuli and situations. It measures flight, freezing, defensive threat and attack, and risk assessment in response to an unconditioned predator stimulus, as well as pretest activity and postthreat (conditioned) defensiveness to the test context. Factor analyses of these indicate four factors relating to cognitive and emotional aspects of defense, flight, and defensiveness to the test context. In the Mouse Defense Test Battery, GABA(A)-benzodiazepine anxiolytics produce consistent reductions in defensive threat/attack and risk assessment, while panicolytic and panicogenic drugs selectively reduce and enhance, respectively, flight. Effects of GABA(A)-benzodiazepine, serotonin, and neuropeptide ligands in the Mouse Defense Test Battery are reviewed. This review suggests that the Mouse Defense Test Battery is a sensitive and appropriate tool for preclinical evaluation of drugs potentially effective against defense-related disorders such as anxiety and panic.
29576116<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Persistent alteration in behavioural reactivity to a mild social stressor in rhesus monkeys repeatedly exposed to sevoflurane in infancy.<<>>BACKGROUND: Socio-emotional development is the expression and management of emotions, which in non-human primates can be examined using responses toward increasing levels of threat. Damage to the limbic system alters socio-emotional development in primates. Thus, neuronal and glial cell loss caused by exposure to general anaesthesia early in infancy might also impact socio-emotional development. We recently reported that repeated sevoflurane exposure in the first month of life alters emotional behaviours at 6 months of age and impairs visual recognition memory after the first year of life in rhesus monkeys. The present study evaluated socio-emotional behaviour at 1 and 2 yr of age in those same monkeys to determine the persistence of altered emotional behaviour. METHODS: Rhesus monkeys of both sexes were exposed to sevoflurane anaesthesia three times for 4 h each time in the first 6 weeks of life. At 1 and 2 yr of age, they were tested on the human intruder task, a well-established mild acute social stressor. RESULTS: Monkeys exposed to sevoflurane as infants exhibited normal fear and hostile responses, but exaggerated self-directed (displacement) behaviours, a general indicator of stress and anxiety in non-human primates. CONCLUSIONS: Early repeated sevoflurane exposure in infant non-human primates results in an anxious phenotype that was first detected at 6 months, and persists for at least 2 yr of age. This is the first demonstration of such a prolonged impact of early anaesthesia exposure on emotional reactivity.
15664017<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Age-specific threats induce CRF expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and hippocampus of young rats.<<>>Young animals respond to threatening stimuli in an age-specific way. Their endocrine and behavioral responses reflect the potential threat of the situation at a given age. The aim of the present study was to determine whether corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is involved in the endocrine and behavioral responses to threat and their developmental changes in young rats. Preweaning 14-day-old and postweaning 26-day-old rats were exposed to two age-specific threats, cat odor and an adult male rat. The acute behavioral response was determined during exposure. After exposure, the time courses of the corticosterone response and of CRF expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) and in extrahypothalamic areas were assessed. Preweaning rats became immobile when exposed to cat odor or the male rat, whereas postweaning rats became immobile to cat odor only. Male exposure increased serum corticosterone levels in 14-day-old rats, but cat odor failed to increase levels at either age. Exposure induced elevation of CRF mRNA levels in the PVN that paralleled changes in corticosterone levels. CRF may thus play a role in endocrine regulation and its developmental changes during early life. Neither cat odor nor the adult male altered CRF mRNA levels in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) or the amygdala, but both stimuli increased levels in the hippocampus. Hippocampal CRF mRNA expression levels did not parallel cat odor or male-induced immobility, indicating that CRF is not involved in this response in young rats but may be involved in aspects of learning and memory.
7916235<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Neuroanatomy and neurotransmitter regulation of defensive behaviors and related emotions in mammals.<<>>1. There is suggestive evidence that the septo-hippocampal system and the amygdala are involved in risk assessment behavior, a response to potential threat possibly related to anxiety. In addition, experimental results have been reported implicating the medial hypothalamus in coordinated escape, while the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) and the median raphe nucleus serotonergic projection to the hippocampus seem to mediate freezing. The latter defensive behaviors are evoked by distal danger stimuli and may be viewed as manifestations of fear. Finally, there is a sound body of evidence indicating that the PAG commands primitive fight or flight reactions elicited by proximal threat, acute pain or asphyxia. These defense reactions may be related to rage and panic, respectively. In contrast, the lateral septal area and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis have been shown to exert tonic inhibitory influence on defense. 2. Experimental evidence indicates that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) tonically inhibits defensive behavior in the amygdala, hypothalamus and the PAG, an effect opposed by excitatory amino acids. Among monoamines, serotonin (5-HT) has been suggested to facilitate anxiety in the amygdala while inhibiting panic in the PAG. The role of noradrenaline in defense is less clear, although hypotheses implicating the locus coeruleus in anxiety and panic have been suggested. Among peptides, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) acting as a central neurotransmitter is thought to mediate behavioral and physiological effects of acute stress, while opioid peptides have been shown to inhibit defense in the amygdala and in the dorsal PAG. Finally, acetylcholine seems to facilitate defensive behavior in the hypothalamus and the PAG.
11115203<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Symptom severity and perceptions in subjects with panic attacks.<<>>OBJECTIVES: To (1) identify aspects that defined the self-perceived worst panic attack, (2) determine how subjects with panic attacks perceive symptoms compared with control subjects, and (3) determine the role of symptom perceptions in seeking care for the worst panic attack. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Community-based. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-seven subjects with panic attacks as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition (with or without panic disorder), and 97 demographically matched controls. INTERVENTION: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subjects and controls completed the Symptom Perception Scales, and subjects with panic attacks completed the Acute Panic Inventory and a questionnaire concerning care-seeking behavior for their self-perceived worst attack. RESULTS: Compared with controls, subjects with panic attacks perceived many symptoms as more embarrassing but differed little in their perceptions of need for treatment, threat to life, and disruption of functioning. Particular symptoms (ie, dyspnea, fear, dizziness, and faintness) tended to differ in most perceptions. However, symptom perceptions did not play a significant role in care-seeking behavior for the worst attack. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with panic attacks perceive symptoms as more embarrassing than controls, and have different perceptions about particular symptoms. Cognitive approaches addressing negative patient perceptions may reduce anxiety, inappropriate use of health care services, and adverse outcomes. Arch Fam Med. 2000;9:1028-1035
31000694<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Oxytocin receptors in the dorsolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) bias fear learning toward temporally predictable cued fear.<<>>The inability to discriminate between threat and safety is a hallmark of stress-induced psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder. Dorsolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTdl) is critically involved in the modulation of fear and anxiety, and has been proposed to regulate discrimination between signaled (cued, predictable) and unsignaled (unpredictable) threats. We recently showed that oxytocin receptors (OTRs) in the BNSTdl facilitate acquisition of cued fear measured in a fear-potentiated startle (FPS). In the current study, using in vivo microdialysis in awake male Sprague-Dawley rats, a double immunofluorescence approach with confocal microscopy, as well as retrograde tracing of hypothalamic BNST-projecting OT neurons, we investigated whether fear conditioning activates OT system and modulates OT release. To determine the role of OTR in fear memory formation, we also infused OTR antagonist or OT into the BNSTdl before fear conditioning and measured rats' ability to discriminate between cued (signaled) and non-cued (unsignaled) fear using FPS. In contrast to acute stress (exposure to forced swim stress or foot shocks alone), cued fear conditioning increases OT content in BNSTdl microdialysates. In addition, fear conditioning induces moderate activation of OT neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and robust activation in the supraoptic and accessory nuclei of the hypothalamus. Application of OT into the BNSTdl facilitates fear learning toward signaled, predictable threats, whereas blocking OTR attenuates this effect. We conclude that OTR neurotransmission in the BNSTdl plays a pivotal role in strengthening fear learning of temporally predictable, signaled threats.
25012621<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Mechanisms of developing post-traumatic stress disorder: new targets for drug development and other potential interventions.<<>>The post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is defined as a severe anxiety disorder that develops after exposure to an event with actual, threatened, or perceived death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of oneself or others that results in significant psychological trauma. Moreover, the ability of people to handle acute severe stress experiences varies among individuals. Depending on the underlying personality and resiliency, therefore, PTSD can occur in individuals exposed to exceedingly stressful incidences or those who have encountered seemingly less overwhelming stressors. In addition to severe stressful exposure, multiple other factors including genetic susceptibility; past experiences; cultural, spiritual, and personal beliefs; bullying and harassments; and lack of support at the workplace, social, and home environement may contribute to the development of PTSD. Author investigated multiple potential mechanisms for the development and sustenance of PTSD based on the recent literature and his own experiences and insight. Based on this search, author indicates that among other pathological and biochemical abnormalities, hormonal aberrations are most likely key mechanisms initiating and the maintenance of the PTSD. These pathophysiological neuro-hormonal changes instigate maladaptive learning processes caused by sustained high levels of anxiety and fear, through a hypo-responsive hypothalamic-pituitary axis and hyper-responsive catecholamine system (persistently elevated blood norepinephrine levels and lower than appropriate glucocorticoid levels). In addition to having inappropriately low serum cortisol levels and high epinephrine and norepinephrine levels, patients with PTSD also have mitochondrial dysfunctions and other hormonal abnormalities. Based on these data, author concluded that these pathological, biochemical and sustained neurohormonal abnormalities are likely to influence the structural brain changes, particularly in the amygdala and hippocampus, which are characteristics of patients with PTSD. Considering these abnormalities, neuroendocrine system needs to be considered as a key target for new drug development for prevention and treatment of PTSD.
22585232<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol on evaluation of emotional images.<<>>There is growing evidence that drugs of abuse alter processing of emotional information in ways that could be attractive to users. Our recent report that Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) diminishes amygdalar activation in response to threat-related faces suggests that THC may modify evaluation of emotionally-salient, particularly negative or threatening, stimuli. In this study, we examined the effects of acute THC on evaluation of emotional images. Healthy volunteers received two doses of THC (7.5 and 15 mg; p.o.) and placebo across separate sessions before performing tasks assessing facial emotion recognition and emotional responses to pictures of emotional scenes. THC significantly impaired recognition of facial fear and anger, but it only marginally impaired recognition of sadness and happiness. The drug did not consistently affect ratings of emotional scenes. THC's effects on emotional evaluation were not clearly related to its mood-altering effects. These results support our previous work, and show that THC reduces perception of facial threat. Nevertheless, THC does not appear to positively bias evaluation of emotional stimuli in general.
15853189<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Bioterrorism and smallpox: policies, practices, and implications for social work.<<>>Terrorist acts and the fear of terrorism have become a part of everyday life in the early 21st century. Among the threats most feared is bioterrorism, including the intentional release of smallpox. With the invasion of Iraq and toppling of the Saddam Hussein regime, acute bioterrorism fears have abated; however, an ongoing threat remains.This article addresses the need for knowledge and rational policies in dealing with potential bioterrorism attacks. It presents information on four of the most likely bioterrorism agents: smallpox, anthrax, botulism, and plague. It illustrates the importance of accurate knowledge and rational decision making in addressing the threat of terrorism through the intentional release of biological weapons such as smallpox. Finally, it provides information essential for social workers to make informed practice decisions, to educate clients and the public, and to advocate for sound public policy.
14518156<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>[Israeli guidelines for investigation and management of SARS cases and their contacts].<<>>As the first emerging epidemic of the 21st century, SARS has raised much interest and fear among statesmen, economists, and the general public, as well as within the medical community. This new disease is characterized by several daunting challenges, including person-to-person transmission, an environmentally resistant agent, a non-specific clinical presentation, and a high fatality rate among high risk individuals. In Israel, as elsewhere, public health authorities were forced to quickly design appropriate measures to confront this new threat. The Israeli guidelines for surveillance, epidemiologic investigation and intervention in the event of a SARS outbreak were drafted in the absence of complete data on some of the most basic epidemiologic characteristics of the disease. Discrepancies between published guidelines from several countries made the decision-making process even more complicated. We describe the epidemiologic guidelines for SARS drafted by the Israeli working group, as well as the considerations on which they are based. The recent experience with this new outbreak has already provided several valuable lessons on policy making which may help future planning for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.
24899597<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Defensive eye-blink startle responses in a human experimental model of anxiety.<<>>Inhalation of low concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) triggers anxious behaviours in rodents via chemosensors in the amygdala, and increases anxiety, autonomic arousal and hypervigilance in healthy humans. However, it is not known whether CO2 inhalation modulates defensive behaviours coordinated by this network in humans. We examined the effect of 7.5% CO2 challenge on the defensive eye-blink startle response. A total of 27 healthy volunteers completed an affective startle task during inhalation of 7.5% CO2 and air. The magnitude and latency of startle eye-blinks were recorded whilst participants viewed aversive and neutral pictures. We found that 7.5% CO2 increased state anxiety and raised concurrent measures of skin conductance and heart rate (HR). CO2 challenge did not increase startle magnitude, but slowed the onset of startle eye-blinks. The effect of CO2 challenge on HR covaried with its effects on both subjective anxiety and startle latency. Our findings are discussed with reference to startle profiles during conditions of interoceptive threat, increased cognitive load and in populations characterised by anxiety, compared with acute fear and panic.
11778420<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Psychological effects of nuclear and radiological warfare.<<>>Not since 1945 has the world experienced nuclear warfare, although there has been the threat of nuclear terrorism and a large number of nuclear/radiological accidents. Most people fear a nuclear/radiological threat even more than a conventional explosion due both to their inability to perceive the presence of radiation with the ordinary human senses and to concerns about perceived long-lasting radiation effects. Studies of radiological accidents have found that for every actually contaminated casualty, there may be as many as 500 people who are concerned, eager to be screened for contamination, sometimes panicked, and showing psychosomatic reactions mimicking actual radiation effects. Data from the Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks revealed widespread acute reactions such as psychic numbing, severe anxiety, and disorganized behavior, and there were later chronic effects such as survivor guilt and psychosomatic reactions. Such responses would likely be common in any future nuclear/radiological accident, terrorist attack, or warfare.
22282119<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Acute and lasting effects of FG-7142 on defensive and approach-attack behavior in cats--implications for models of anxiety which use response suppression.<<>>The effect of the anxiogenic beta-carboline, FG-7142, on defense and approach-attack behavior in the cat was investigated. FG-7142 (10 mg/kg) enhanced defensive responses to rats and mice when tested 10 and 20 min after injection. At the same time, FG-7142 suppressed approach and attack responses to prey. Behavioral effects of FG-7142 were blocked by the specific benzodiazepine receptor blocker RO-15-1788 (10 mg/kg). One or two administrations of FG-7142 were sufficient to produce a lasting (up to 105 days) enhancement of defensive response to rats but not to mice. Defensive response to conspecific threat vocalizations was also lastingly increased. Two injections of FG-7142 produced a lasting suppression of approach-attack on rats only, whereas one injection of FG-7142 did not. The lasting suppression of some measures of approach-attack was found to be independent of the fear-enhancing properties of FG-7142. Tests of the effects of RO-15-1788 on the lasting after-effects of FG-7142 revealed at least two mechanisms which mediate the lasting changes in behavior, one which is dependent upon the benzodiazepine receptor and one which is not. The implications of these findings for rodent models of anxiety which use response suppression to assess fearful 'anxiogenic' effects of drugs are discussed.
6424169<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Psychiatric problems of AIDS inpatients at the New York Hospital: preliminary report.<<>>A retrospective review of the charts of 52 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the New York Hospital was conducted to determine the prevalence of recorded psychiatric complications and the use of psychiatric consultation. Neuropsychiatric complications were found to be pervasive clinical features in AIDS patients hospitalized during acute illness. Mood disturbance was identified in an overwhelming majority of the patients (82.7 percent), and signs of organic mental syndrome (DSM III) were noted in 65.4 percent; references to neuropsychiatric complications appeared in every patient's chart. Neurological complications were seldom explicitly diagnosed or treated. Psychiatric consultation was requested for 10 patients (19.2 percent) because of management problems, for diagnostic assessment, or by self-referral. Only one patient was given a psychiatric diagnosis at discharge. The results suggest that the neuropsychiatric complications of AIDS are underdiagnosed during acute medical illness and that psychiatric consultation is underutilized. AIDS patients have a heightened risk of psychological problems. Contributing factors may include the threat to life, severe physical debilitation, central nervous system involvement, fear of contagion, disclosure of homosexuality or drug abuse, and guilt associated with sexual transmission.
20947066<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Is ecstasy an "empathogen"? Effects of +/-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine on prosocial feelings and identification of emotional states in others.<<>>BACKGROUND: Users of +/-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), "ecstasy," report that the drug produces unusual psychological effects, including increased empathy and prosocial feelings. These "empathogenic" effects are cited as reasons for recreational ecstasy use and also form the basis for the proposed use of MDMA in psychotherapy. However, they have yet to be characterized in controlled studies. Here, we investigate effects of MDMA on an important social cognitive capacity, the identification of emotional expression in others, and on socially relevant mood states. METHODS: Over four sessions, healthy ecstasy-using volunteers (n = 21) received MDMA (.75, 1.5 mg/kg), methamphetamine (METH) (20 mg), and placebo under double-blind, randomized conditions. They completed self-report ratings of relevant affective states and undertook tasks in which they identified emotions from images of faces, pictures of eyes, and vocal cues. RESULTS: MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) significantly increased ratings of feeling "loving" and "friendly", and MDMA (.75 mg/kg) increased "loneliness". Both MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) and METH increased "playfulness"; only METH increased "sociability". MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) robustly decreased accuracy of facial fear recognition relative to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: The drug MDMA increased "empathogenic" feelings but reduced accurate identification of threat-related facial emotional signals in others, findings consistent with increased social approach behavior rather than empathy. This effect of MDMA on social cognition has implications for both recreational and therapeutic use. In recreational users, acute drug effects might alter social risk-taking while intoxicated. Socioemotional processing alterations such as those documented here might underlie possible psychotherapeutic benefits of this drug; further investigation of such mechanisms could inform treatment design to maximize active components of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.
3449053<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Severe threat in the genesis of panic disorder.<<>>The hypothesis that panic disorder is a separate biological disease has attracted a great deal of controversy in recent years. One of the cornerstones of this theory is that panic attacks arise spontaneously, suggesting that the illness is generated by an autonomous physiological process. A number of cases are reported that illustrate Beck's theory that cognitive factors are central to the genesis of acute anxiety. Evidence for a developmental/cognitive theory of anxiety is discussed, and it is concluded that a purely biological model for panic disorder is inadequate.
17284275<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Impact of cardiac disease on couples' relationships.<<>>AIM: This paper reports a study to describe meanings that couples mutually assign to, and practices they develop, after the onset of cardiac disease and to understand the impact of the illness on the couples' relationships in everyday life. BACKGROUND: Patients as well as partners are affected by the onset of cardiovascular disease. Social support within intimate relationships has been shown to be important for patient survival and well-being, and couples' coping strategies are pivotal for well-being and adjustment to the chronic condition in both patients with cardiovascular disease and their partners. METHOD: Twenty-four couples participated in this phenomenological study. Data were collected during 2003. Participants were interviewed after having been hospitalized due to an acute event and having participated in a rehabilitation programme. Three in-depth interviews were obtained for each dyad: one couple interview and two individual interviews with each partner of the dyad. Paradigm cases were sought and thematic analyses conducted. FINDINGS: All couples experienced a 'brush with death' at the onset of heart disease, which called for changes in lifestyle. Three distinct patterns of dealing with the illness emerged. The first revealed that some couples assess the illness as a positive, transformative experience in their lives, bringing them closer together. The second showed that a proportion of couples experience the illness as a threat which imposes fear on both partners. The challenges are faced as mutual tasks and new routines are developed. The third pattern revealed couples who experience a missed opportunity to change. These couples are disenchanted about each other but return to life as usual. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses can use the information gained from this study to support couples in their attempts to come to terms with the illness, and can enhance their supportive role in rehabilitation efforts.
17620910<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Are Belgian hospitals prepared for an H5N1-pandemic?<<>>OBJECTIVE: Virulent airborne diseases can be a real burden to a nation's health system. The most recent threat is the fear of a mutation-induced H5N1-influenza pandemic. We studied whether Belgian hospitals are able to deal with H5N1-influenza infected patients in the case of a pandemic. Many patients, including children, may require artificial ventilation within 48 h after admission. METHODS: A survey aimed at determining 'availability and preparedness' was sent by e-mail to the different Belgian Emergency Departments. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Sixty-five hospitals were finally included. The amount of patients being potentially admitted is limited, owing to the reduced number of intensive care beds equipped with automatic ventilators. Furthermore, the number of available intensive care beds for children is still lower than for adult patients. The number of mortuary places, in the case of a catastrophe, is also insufficient. Although most hospitals set up a disaster plan on H5N1, there are only limited stocks of antiviral medication to protect the hospital staff in the acute phase. A separate triage area is only available in a limited number of hospitals. We conclude that Belgian hospitals and emergency departments are not equipped to deal with potential pandemic situations.
30947514<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Quantifying Dispositional Fear as Threat Sensitivity: Development and Initial Validation of a Model-Based Scale Measure.<<>>The Research Domain Criteria initiative aims to reorient the focus of psychopathology research toward biobehavioral constructs that cut across different modalities of measurement, including self-report and neurophysiology. Constructs within the Research Domain Criteria framework are intentionally transdiagnostic, with the construct of "acute threat," for example, broadly relevant to clinical problems and associated traits involving fearfulness and stress reactivity. A potentially valuable referent for research on the construct of acute threat is a structural model of fear/fearlessness questionnaires known to predict variations in physiological threat reactivity as indexed by startle potentiation. The aim of the current work was to develop an efficient, item-based scale measure of the general factor of this structural model for use in studies of dispositional threat sensitivity and its relationship to psychopathology. A self-report scale consisting of 44 items from a conceptually relevant, nonproprietary questionnaire was first developed in a sample of 1,307 student participants, using the general factor of the fear/fearlessness model as a direct referent. This new Trait Fear scale was then evaluated for convergent and discriminant validity with measures of personality and psychopathology in a separate sample ( n = 213) consisting of community adults and undergraduate students. The strong performance of the scale in this criterion-validation sample suggests that it can provide an effective means for indexing variations along a dispositional continuum of fearfulness reflecting variations in sensitivity to acute threat.
16555061<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Scopolamine induces impairments in the recognition of human facial expressions of anger and disgust.<<>>RATIONALE: Recent psychopharmacological studies lend support to the notion of partially dissociable neuronal systems dedicated to processing specific emotions. For example, GABA-ergic enhancement after an acute dose of the benzodiazepine, diazepam, produces specific impairments in anger and fear recognition. However, it is unclear if these impairments are a general property of benzodiazepines and other drugs that produce a similar profile of neurocognitive impairment to benzodiazepines, such as the anticholinergic, scopolamine. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of scopolamine and the benzodiazepine, lorazepam, on emotion-recognition accuracy. METHODS: A double-blind independent group design was used with 48 healthy volunteers to compare the effects of scopolamine and lorazepam with an inactive placebo on a commonly used emotion-recognition task. Control measures included an episodic memory task and subjective mood ratings. RESULTS: Anger and disgust recognition accuracy was impaired after scopolamine. In contrast, lorazepam produced no impairment in emotion-recognition despite producing similar levels of sedation and anterograde amnesia to scopolamine. CONCLUSIONS: Scopolamine-induced cholinergic hypofunction selectively impaired the recognition accuracy of disgust and anger facial expressions. The effects of scopolamine on emotion-recognition are similar to those found in Huntington's disease patients. Furthermore, the impairments in anger and fear recognition previously observed with diazepam do not appear to be a general property of benzodiazepines. This suggests that alterations in emotional processing involving changes in the ability to recognize threat-related emotions (particularly, fear and anger) may not be a principal mechanism underlying anxiolysis or paradoxical aggression seen with benzodiazepines.
28393598<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>[Zika virus infection in pregnancy].<<>>The Zika virus is a flavivirus spread by mosquitoes. Its primary vectors are the Aedes aegypti and the Aedes albopictus. Before 2007 it sporadically caused benign morbidity. Since 2015, it started spreading "explosively" in America, especially in Brazil. In August 2016 they reported cases from New York and Poland, too. Most of the infections don't produce any symptoms, but can cause grave complications. The most important lesion is microcephalia that forms in fetuses. Microcephalia's most serious consequence is mental retardation, which puts great burden on both the family and the society. The viral infection increases the incidence of Guillain-Barre syndrome. This is an acute autoimmune disease which causes demyelination and, in the worst cases, it can also be fatal. Yet we do not possess adequate and specific vaccination nor antiviral therapy, although, since July 2016, the effectiveness of a DNA based vaccine is being tested on humans. More than half of the world's population lives in areas contaminated by infected mosquitoes so there is a great need for the development of an effective method against the vector mosquitoes. Sadly, even the vector control strategies aren't effective enough to push back the epidemic. Pregnant or fertile women must take the highest precautions against mosquito bites, especially if they travel to regions ravaged by the epidemic. The safest solution would be to postpone both the trip and the childbearing. In Europe, the vectors aren't spread enough to cause major threat, except maybe the warmer regions bordered by the Mediterranean Sea. However, it is possible that in the near future other viruses spread by Aedes mosquitoes could appear. Naturally, the travellers and immigrants, who came from endemic regions can also contribute to the spread of the epidemic. Thanks to the changes in global weather, there were reported findings of mosquitoes of the Aedes albopictus species in Hungary, which are slowly invading the continent, although we do not have information about their settlement in the country. The doctors may encounter introduced cases and we do not have to fear the spreading of the epidemic to our country, but in the bordering Slovakia and Slovenia infections have been reported. The future of the Zika virus is yet unpredictable, although looking at the global spread of the Dengue and Chikungunya viruses, a worldwide spread is expectable in the near future. Orv.

25592213<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>ASICs and cardiovascular homeostasis.<<>>In this review we address primarily the role of ASICs in determining sensory signals from arterial baroreceptors, peripheral chemoreceptors, and cardiopulmonary and somatic afferents. Alterations in these sensory signals during acute cardiovascular stresses result in changes in sympathetic and parasympathetic activities that restore cardiovascular homeostasis. In pathological states, however, chronic dysfunctions of these afferents result in serious sympatho-vagal imbalances with significant increases in mortality and morbidity. We identified a role for ASIC2 in the mechano-sensitivity of aortic baroreceptors and of ASIC3 in the pH sensitivity of carotid bodies. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, we reported decreased expression of ASIC2 in nodose ganglia neurons and overexpression of ASIC3 in carotid bodies. This reciprocal expression of ASIC2 and ASIC3 results in reciprocal changes in sensory sensitivity of baro- and chemoreceptors and a consequential synergistic exaggeration sympathetic nerve activity. A similar reciprocal sensory dysautonomia prevails in heart failure and increases the risk of mortality. There is also evidence that ASIC heteromers in skeletal muscle afferents contribute significantly to the exercise pressor reflex. In cardiac muscle afferents of the dorsal root ganglia, they contribute to nociception and to the detrimental sympathetic activation during ischemia. Finally, we report that an inhibitory influence of ASIC2-mediated baroreceptor activity suppresses the sympatho-excitatory reflexes of the chemoreceptors and skeletal muscle afferents, as well as the ASIC1a-mediated excitation of central neurons during fear, threat, or panic. The translational potential of activation of ASIC2 in cardiovascular disease states may be a beneficial sympatho-inhibition and parasympathetic activation.

30284333<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>The nature and timing of distress among post-treatment haematological cancer survivors.<<>>Many people with haematological cancers will not meet the diagnostic criteria for a psychological disorder, but will still suffer distress during treatment and beyond. The current study aimed to explore the nature and timing of psychosocial distress experienced by haematological cancer survivors. Twenty-three post-treatment haematological cancer survivors participated in a semi-structured interview. Data were analysed using thematic analysis which involved identifying, analysing and reporting themes. Four themes were identified: Apprehension about leaving the safety of the health care system comprises the struggles encountered when transitioning from patient to survivor, Uncertainty and life transitions in the post-treatment period encompasses the changes survivors face when attempting to re-enter their "normal" lives, Distress associated with ongoing physical problems or impairment describes issues associated with the ongoing physical sequelae, and Fear of recurrence encapsulates how the continuing threat of cancer recurrence impacted survivors. This study has found that distress is ongoing for many haematological cancer survivors in the post-treatment period. It is imperative that distress is identified and support offered to those in need to prevent further psychosocial issues. It is especially important to consider the psychosocial needs of survivors in the post-treatment stage who are discharged from the health system may be unsure where to seek help.
18555267<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Histopathology of the alarm reaction in small odontocetes.<<>>Pathological changes in the organs and tissues of beach-stranded, net-caught or captive small odontocete cetaceans (whales and dolphins) are reported. These changes include contraction band necrosis of cardiac and smooth muscles, smooth muscle spasm, ischemic injury to the intestinal mucosa (especially the mucosa of the small intestine) and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) of the proximal tubules of the nephron. Spastic contraction of terminal bronchiolar muscular sphincters was also observed. The changes are consistent with multi-systemic injury caused by massive release of endogenous catecholamines or vasospasm leading to ischemic injury, followed by reperfusion and reperfusion injury. The histopathological findings suggest that the reflex response of an odontocete to any major perceived threat (the "alarm reaction") is to activate the physiological adaptations to diving or escape to an extreme or pathological level, resulting, if greatly prolonged, in widespread ischemic injury to tissues. These observations may explain why these species die abruptly from handling or transportation and why the mortality of highly stressed beach-stranded animals is very high.
22508996<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>A brief report of surveillance of traumatic experiences and exposures after the earthquake-tsunami in American Samoa, 2009.<<>>CONTEXT: Rapid mental health surveillance during the acute phase of a disaster response can inform the allocation of limited clinical resources and provide essential household-level risk estimates for recovery planning. OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of the PsySTART Rapid Mental Health Triage and Incident Management System for individual-level clinical triage and traumatic exposure assessment in the aftermath of a large-scale disaster. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, comparative review of mental health triage data collected with the PsySTART system from survivors of the September 2009 earthquake-tsunami in American Samoa. Data were obtained from two sources--secondary triage of patients and a standardized community assessment survey-and analyzed descriptively. The main outcome measures were survivor-reported traumatic experiences and exposures--called triage factors--associated with risk for developing severe distress and new mental health disorders following disasters. RESULTS: The most common triage factors reported by survivors referred for mental health services were "felt extreme panic/fear" (93%) and "felt direct threat to life" (93%). The most common factor reported by persons in tsunami-affected communities was "felt extreme panic or fear" (75%). Proportions of severe triage factors reported by persons living in the community were consistently lower than those reported by patients referred for mental health services. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of evidence-based mental health triage and community assessment gave hospital-based providers, local public health officials, and federal response teams a strategy to match limited clinical resources with survivors at greatest risk. Also, it produced a common operating picture of acute and chronic mental health needs among disaster systems of care operating in American Samoa.
25047726<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Travel implications of emerging coronaviruses: SARS and MERS-CoV.<<>>The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and of the Middle East Syndrome Cornavirus (MERS-CoV) caused widespread fear and concern for their potential threat to global health security. There are similarities and differences in the epidemiology and clinical features between these two diseases. The origin of SARS-COV and MERS-CoV is thought to be an animal source with subsequent transmission to humans. The identification of both the intermediate host and the exact route of transmission of MERS-CoV is crucial for the subsequent prevention of the introduction of the virus into the human population. So far MERS-CoV had resulted in a limited travel-associated human cases with no major events related to the Hajj.
21996304<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Medial frontal hyperactivity to sad faces in generalized social anxiety disorder and modulation by oxytocin.<<>>Generalized social anxiety disorder (GSAD) is associated with heightened limbic and prefrontal activation to negative social cues conveying threat (e.g. fearful faces), but less is known about brain response to negative non-threatening social stimuli. The neuropeptide oxytocin (Oxt) has been shown to attenuate (and normalize) fear-related brain activation and reactivity to emotionally negative cues. Here, we examined the effects of intranasal Oxt on cortical activation to non-threatening sad faces in patients with GSAD and matched controls (Con). In a double-blind placebo-controlled within-subjects design, the cortical activation to sad and happy (vs. neutral) faces was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging following acute intranasal administration of 24 IU Oxt and placebo. Relative to the Con group, GSAD patients exhibited heightened activity to sad faces in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC/BA 10) extending into anterior cingulate cortex (ACC/BA 32). Oxt significantly reduced this heightened activation in the mPFC/ACC regions to levels similar to that of controls. These findings suggest that GSAD is associated with cortical hyperactivity to non-threatening negative but not positive social cues and that Oxt attenuates this exaggerated cortical activity. The modulation of cortical activity by Oxt highlights a broader mechanistic role of this neuropeptide in modulating socially negative cues in GSAD.
27775<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Hospital phobia: a rapid desensitization technique.<<>>The less disabling phobias do not normally present a problem in that the stimulus may be avoided. This would also apply to hospital phobia until an acute medical or surgical problem might arise, when avoidance could constitute a direct threat to life. Although phobic illness is a common problem the small number of cases of hospital phobia recorded may represent the tip of the iceberg beneath which could be many phobic patients who deny their symptoms and risk their health because of their irrational fear. A case of hopsital phobia in a pregnant patient with suspected disproportion was treated by a rapid desensitization technique using hypnosis. After five sessions of 30 min each, the patient was symptom free. This simple method of desensitization, if more widely known would considerably minimize the risk caused by concealment of the phobic problem.
11430288<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Emotions and illness.<<>>AIM: This paper discusses issues central to emotional expression in illness. Its aim is to challenge the psychopathological paradigm currently utilized within healthcare and propose an alternative model based on healthy emotions. BACKGROUND: Emotions are important to human survival. It is argued that most patients will have an emotional response to their illness but anxiety and depression are unlikely to be representative of most patients experience. The paper focuses on two important negative emotions, fear and sadness, and their psychopathological associates, anxiety and depression. Problems of diagnosing anxiety and depression in practice are highlighted. It is contended that emotional reaction to illness is normal and that emotions expressed are likely to hold clues to individual adaptation. It is argued that in health care, emotions should be assessed as healthy reactions to a survival threat and merit study from this perspective if we wish to understand individual patient illness reaction and adaptation better. Literature from cardiology is used to illustrate clinical problems. RATIONALE: Given the present knowledge of emotions, it should be possible to utilize emotion theory as a paradigm for studying human reaction to illness. This in turn could help shape studies on adherence and adaptation. CONCLUSION: The reaction and experience of patient illness is unlikely to be understood through the psychopathology paradigm. A better understanding of patient reaction to their illness is more likely to emerge through the study of basic emotions during acute life-threatening episodes.
23340244<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Translational developmental studies of stress on brain and behavior: implications for adolescent mental health and illness?<<>>Adolescence is the transition from childhood to adulthood, with onset marked by puberty and the offset by relative independence from parents. Across species, it is a time of incredible change that carries increased risks and rewards. The ability of the individual to respond adequately to the mental, physical and emotional stresses of life during this time is a function of both their early environment and their present state. In this article, we focus on the effects that acute threat and chronic stress have on the brain and behavior in humans and rodents. First, we highlight developmental changes in frontolimbic function as healthy individuals transition into and out of adolescence. Second, we examine genetic factors that may enhance susceptibility to stress in one individual over another using translation from genetic mouse models to human neuroimaging. Third, we examine how the timing and nature of stress varies in its impact on brain and behavior. These findings are discussed in the context of implications for adolescent mental health and illness.
15282214<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Does anticipation of back pain predispose to back trouble?<<>>Limb movement imparts a perturbation to the body. The impact of that perturbation is limited via anticipatory postural adjustments. The strategy by which the CNS controls anticipatory postural adjustments of the trunk muscles during limb movement is altered during acute back pain and in people with recurrent back pain, even when they are pain free. The altered postural strategy probably serves to protect the spine in the short term, but it is associated with a cost and is thought to predispose spinal structures to injury in the long term. It is not known why this protective strategy might occur even when people are pain free, but one possibility is that it is caused by the anticipation of back pain. In eight healthy subjects, recordings of intramuscular EMG were made from the trunk muscles during single and repetitive arm movements. Anticipation of experimental back pain and anticipation of experimental elbow pain were elicited by the threat of painful cutaneous stimulation. There was no effect of anticipated experimental elbow pain on postural adjustments. During anticipated experimental back pain, for single arm movements there was delayed activation of the deep trunk muscles and augmentation of at least one superficial trunk muscle. For repetitive arm movements, there was decreased activity and a shift from biphasic to monophasic activation of the deep trunk muscles and increased activity of superficial trunk muscles during anticipation of back pain. In both instances, the changes were consistent with adoption of an altered strategy for postural control and were similar to those observed in patients with recurrent back pain. We conclude that anticipation of experimental back pain evokes a protective postural strategy that stiffens the spine. This protective strategy is associated with compressive cost and is thought to predispose to spinal injury if maintained long term.
19493626<<>>Acute_Threat_Fear<<>>Salivary testosterone and a trinucleotide (CAG) length polymorphism in the androgen receptor gene predict amygdala reactivity in men.<<>>In studies employing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), reactivity of the amygdala to threat-related sensory cues (viz., facial displays of negative emotion) has been found to correlate positively with interindividual variability in testosterone levels of women and young men and to increase on acute administration of exogenous testosterone. Many of the biological actions of testosterone are mediated by intracellular androgen receptors (ARs), which exert transcriptional control of androgen-dependent genes and are expressed in various regions of the brain, including the amygdala. Transactivation potential of the AR decreases (yielding relative androgen insensitivity) with expansion a polyglutamine stretch in the N-terminal domain of the AR protein, as encoded by a trinucleotide (CAG) repeat polymorphism in exon 1 of the X-chromosome AR gene. Here we examined whether amygdala reactivity to threat-related facial expressions (fear, anger) differs as a function of AR CAG length variation and endogenous (salivary) testosterone in a mid-life sample of 41 healthy men (mean age=45.6 years, range: 34-54 years; CAG repeats, range: 19-29). Testosterone correlated inversely with participant age (r=-0.39, p=0.012) and positively with number of CAG repeats (r=0.45, p=0.003). In partial correlations adjusted for testosterone level, reactivity in the ventral amygdala was lowest among men with largest number of CAG repeats. This inverse association was seen in both the right (r(p)=-0.34, p<0.05) and left (r(p)=-0.32, p<0.05) hemisphere. Activation of dorsal amygdala, correlated positively with individual differences in salivary testosterone, also in right (r=0.40, p<0.02) and left (r=0.32, p<0.05) hemisphere, but was not affected by number of CAG repeats. Hence, androgenic influences on threat-related reactivity in the ventral amygdala may be moderated partially by CAG length variation in the AR gene. Because individual differences in salivary testosterone also predicted dorsal amygdala reactivity and did so independently of CAG repeats, it is suggested that androgenic influences within this anatomically distinct region may be mediated, in part, by non-genomic or AR-independent mechanisms.
23457085<<>>Arousal<<>>Burnout and vigor as predictors of the incidence of hyperlipidemia among healthy employees.<<>>We examined the effects of burnout and vigor on the incidence of hyperlipidemia. Based on the bivariate theoretical approach to negative and positive affects and on past studies on the prediction of blood lipids by burnout and vigor, we expected increases from Time 1 (T1) to Time 2 (T2) in burnout levels to be associated with an increase in the risk for hyperlipidemia and T1-T2 increases in vigor levels to be associated with a decrease in the risk of hyperlipidemia. Our sample consisted of 3,337 healthy employees (2,214 men and 1,123 women) who were followed up for about 27 months on average. Burnout and vigor were assessed by well-validated multiple-item instruments. We used logistic regressions and controlled for variables associated with blood lipids as well as with vigor and burnout. We cross-validated all self-reported hyperlipidemia by their T2 lipids levels. As expected, we found that T1-T2 increases in vigor levels were associated with a decreased risk of hyperlipidemia. However, the T1-T2 change in burnout levels was marginally significant (p = .06) in predicting hyperlipidemia. We consider our finding that vigor and burnout are independently associated with the risk of hyperlipidemia as providing support for the bivariate approach to affective states. In addition, our major finding suggests a possible mechanism via which vigor influences physical health outcomes.
25012570<<>>Arousal<<>>Measuring affect at work based on the valence and arousal circumplex model.<<>>Affective states have become a central topic of interest in research on organizational behavior. Recently, scholars have been paying more attention to the proposals of the Circumplex Model (Russell, 1980) in order to gain a finer grained understanding of job-related affect. However, the limited availability of well-validated measures to test this model in work settings, particularly in non English-speaking populations, is still a major drawback. Using three samples of English-speaking and Spanish-speaking workers, this article offers the cross-validation of the Multi-Affect Indicator (Warr, 2007) between the original English version and its corresponding translation into Spanish. Multi-group Structural Equation Modeling supported the instrument's structure and its invariance between the two languages (English: chi2 = 65.56, df = 48, p = .05; RMSEA = .06; CFI = .97; Spanish: chi2 = 68.68, df = 48, p = .03; RMSEA = .05; CFI = .97). Furthermore, Circular Stochastic Modeling supported the theoretically proposed circumplex representation (chi2 = 139.85, df = 51, p < .01; chi2/df = 2.74, RMSEA = .06). Thus, this study offers an instrument that provides a more accurate approximation to affect at work, both in English and in another of the major language communities in the world, the Spanish-speaking population.
28166792<<>>Arousal<<>>Mothers' pupillary responses to infant facial expressions.<<>>BACKGROUND: Human parental care relies heavily on the ability to monitor and respond to a child's affective states. The current study examined pupil diameter as a potential physiological index of mothers' affective response to infant facial expressions. METHODS: Pupillary time-series were measured from 86 mothers of young infants in response to an array of photographic infant faces falling into four emotive categories based on valence (positive vs. negative) and arousal (mild vs. strong). RESULTS: Pupil dilation was highly sensitive to the valence of facial expressions, being larger for negative vs. positive facial expressions. A separate control experiment with luminance-matched non-face stimuli indicated that the valence effect was specific to facial expressions and cannot be explained by luminance confounds. Pupil response was not sensitive to the arousal level of facial expressions. CONCLUSIONS: The results show the feasibility of using pupil diameter as a marker of mothers' affective responses to ecologically valid infant stimuli and point to a particularly prompt maternal response to infant distress cues.
27322704<<>>Arousal<<>>The influence of positive vs. negative affect on multitasking.<<>>Considerable research has investigated how affect influences performance on a single task; however, little is known about the role of affect in complex multitasking environments. In this paper, 178 participants multitasked in a synthetic work environment (SYNWORK) consisting of memory, visual monitoring, auditory monitoring, and math tasks. Participants multitasked for a 3-min baseline phase (MT1), following which they were randomly assigned to watch one of three affect-induction videos: positive, neutral, or negative. Participants then resumed multitasking for two additional critical phases (MT2, MT3; 3min each). In MT2, performance of the positive and neutral conditions was statistically equivalent and higher than the negative condition. In MT3, the positive condition performed better than the negative condition, with the neutral condition not significantly different from the other two. The differences in overall multitasking scores were largely driven by errors in the Math task (the most cognitively demanding task) in MT2 and the Memory task in MT3. These findings have implications for how positive and negative affective states influence processing in a cognitively demanding multitasking environment.
1574560<<>>Arousal<<>>Immunological variability associated with experimentally-induced positive and negative affective states.<<>>Functional and phenotypic immunological parameters were examined immediately before, after, and 30 minutes after experimentally-induced short-term positive (happiness) and negative (anxiety, depression) affective states and a neutral state, in five healthy subjects. Results indicated that all affective states induced more immune fluctuations (regardless of the direction) than the neutral state. Furthermore, among the affective states, anxiety induced the most immunological variability and depression the least.
28013478<<>>Arousal<<>>Increased Urge to Gamble Following Near-Miss Outcomes May Drive Purchasing Behaviour in Scratch Card Gambling.<<>>Previous research into scratch card gambling has highlighted the effects of these games on players' arousal and affective states. Specifically, near-miss outcomes in scratch cards (uncovering 2 of 3 needed jackpot symbols) have been associated with high levels of physiological and subjective arousal and negative emotional evaluations, including increased frustration. We sought to extend this research by examining whether near-misses prompted increases in gambling urge, and the subsequent purchasing of additional scratch cards. Participants played two scratch cards with varying outcomes with half of the sample experiencing a near-miss for the jackpot prize, and the other half experiencing a regular loss. Players rated their urge to continue gambling after each game outcome, and following the initial playing phase, were then able to use their winnings to purchase additional cards. Our results indicated that near-misses increased the urge to gamble significantly more than regular losses, and urge to gamble in the near-miss group was significantly correlated with purchasing at least one additional card. Although some players in the loss group purchased another card, there was no correlation between urge to gamble and purchasing in this group. Additionally, participants in the near-miss group who purchased additional cards reported higher levels of urge than those who did not purchase more cards. This was not true for the loss group: participants who experienced solely losing outcomes reported similar levels of urge regardless of whether or not they purchased more scratch cards. Despite near-misses' objective status as monetary losses, the increased urge that follows near-miss outcomes may translate into further scratch card gambling for a subset of individuals .
29563889<<>>Arousal<<>>Mood Dimensions Show Distinct Within-Subject Associations With Non-exercise Activity in Adolescents: An Ambulatory Assessment Study.<<>>Physical activity is known to preserve both physical and mental health. However, the physical activity levels of a large proportion of adolescents are insufficient. This is critical, since physical activity levels in youth have been shown to translate into adulthood. Whereas in adult populations, mood has been supposed to be one important psychological factor that drives physical activity in everyday life, this issue has been poorly studied in adolescent populations. Ambulatory Assessment is the state-of-the-art approach to investigate how mood and non-exercise activity fluctuate within persons in everyday life. Through assessments in real time and real life, this method provides ecological validity, bypassing several limitations of traditional assessment methods (e.g., recall biases). To investigate whether mood is associated with non-exercise activity in adolescents, we equipped a community-based sample comprising 113 participants, aged 12-17 years, with GPS-triggered e-diaries querying for valence, energetic arousal, and calmness, and with accelerometers continuously measuring physical activity in their everyday lives for 1 week. We excluded all acceleration data due to participants' exercise activities and thereafter we parameterized non-exercise activity as the mean value across 10-min intervals of movement acceleration intensity following each e-diary prompt. We used multilevel analyses to compute the effects of the mood dimensions on non-exercise activity within 10-min intervals directly following each e-diary prompt. Additionally, we conducted explorative analyses of the time course of the effects, i.e., on different timeframes of non-exercise activity up to 300 min following the mood assessment. The results showed that valence (p < 0.001) and energetic arousal (p < 0.001) were positively associated with non-exercise activity within the 10 min interval, whereas calmness (p < 0.001) was negatively associated with non-exercise activity. Specifically, adolescents who felt more content, full of energy, or less calm were more physically active in subsequent timeframes. Overall, our results demonstrate significant associations of mood with non-exercise activity in younger ages and converge with the previously observed association between mood and physical activity in adults. This knowledge on distinct associations of mood-dimensions with non-exercise activity may help to foster physical activity levels in adolescents.
23519590<<>>Arousal<<>>The effects of autobiographic sexual memory recall on the sexual response of sexually functional men.<<>>In this experimental study, we investigated how recalling positive, negative, and affectively neutral autobiographic sexual experiences in their personal history affected the current sexual response of sexually functional male volunteers. Based on an attentional-capacity account of sexual arousal, we predicted that affectively charged autobiographic sexual memory recall, both with negative and positive valence, would negatively impact genital arousal, compared to recalling affectively neutral sexual experiences. We expected that subjective sexual arousal would not be differentially affected by emotional memory valence. We measured subjective and genital response to erotic video fragments in sexually functional volunteers (N = 24) in a within-subjects, repeated-measures design. For the memory manipulation, participants received instructions to visualize and mentally re-experience positive, negative, and neutral sexual episodes from autobiographic memory. Memory instructions were found to result in the expected affective states. As predicted, compared to recalling neutral memory, mean genital response was significantly lower during recalling positive and negative memory. However, contrary to prediction, subjective sexual arousal was affected, when multilevel analysis was performed, including a time effect. The implications of the findings were discussed with respect to the advancement of theory and therapeutic intervention.
18410197<<>>Arousal<<>>Is running away right? The behavioral activation-behavioral inhibition model of anterior asymmetry.<<>>The measurement of anterior electroencephalograph (EEG) asymmetries has become an important standard paradigm for the investigation of affective states and traits. Findings in this area are typically interpreted within the motivational direction model, which suggests a lateralization of approach and withdrawal motivational systems to the left and right anterior region, respectively. However, efforts to compare this widely adopted model with an alternative account-which relates the left anterior region to behavioral activation independent of the direction of behavior (approach or withdrawal) and the right anterior region to goal conflict-induced behavioral inhibition-are rare and inconclusive. Therefore, the authors measured the EEG in a sample of 93 young men during emotional imagery designed to provide a critical test between the 2 models. The results (e.g., a correlation between left anterior activation and withdrawal motivation) favor the alternative model on the basis of the concepts of behavioral activation and behavioral inhibition. In addition, the present study also supports an association of right parietal activation with physiological arousal and the conceptualization of parietal EEG asymmetry as a mediator of emotion-related physiological arousal.
28912745<<>>Arousal<<>>Emotional Empathic Responses to Dynamic Negative Affective Stimuli Is Gender-Dependent.<<>>Empathy entails the ability to recognize emotional states in others and feel for them. Since empathy does not take place in a static setting, paradigms utilizing more naturalistic, dynamic stimuli instead of static stimuli are perhaps more suited to grasp the origin of this highly complex social skill. The study was set up to test the effect of stimulus dynamics and gender on empathic responses. Participants were 80 healthy volunteers (N = 40 males) aged 22.5 years on average. Behavioral empathy was tested with the multifaceted empathy test, including static emotional stimuli, and the multidimensional movie empathy test (MMET), including dynamic stimuli. Findings showed emotional empathy (EE) responses were higher to negative emotional stimuli in both tasks, i.e., using static as well as dynamic stimuli. Interestingly a gender-dependent response was only seen in the MMET using dynamic stimuli. It was shown that females felt more aroused and were more concerned with people in negative affective states. It was concluded that the MMET is suited to study gender differences in EE.
24955383<<>>Arousal<<>>The pursuit of happiness measurement: a psychometric model based on psychophysiological correlates.<<>>Everyone is interested in the pursuit of happiness, but the real problem for the researchers is how to measure it. Our aim was to deeply investigate happiness measurement through biomedical signals, using psychophysiological methods to objectify the happiness experiences measurements. The classic valence-arousal model of affective states to study happiness has been extensively used in psychophysiology. However, really few studies considered a real combination of these two dimensions and no study further investigated multidimensional models. More, most studies focused mainly on self-report to measure happiness and a deeper psychophysiological investigation on the dimensions of such an experience is still missing. A multidimensional model of happiness is presented and both the dimensions and the measures extracted within each dimension are comprehensively explained. This multidimensional model aims at being a milestone for future systematic study on psychophysiology of happiness and affective states.
25926975<<>>Arousal<<>>Does it matter how you ask? Self-reported emotions to depictions of need-of-help and social context.<<>>BACKGROUND: When humans observe other people's emotions they not only can relate but also experience similar affective states. This capability is seen as a precondition for helping and other prosocial behaviors. Our study aims to quantify the influence of help-related picture content on subjectively experienced affect. It also assesses the impact of different scales on the way people rate their emotional state. METHODS: The participants (N=242) of this study were shown stimuli with help-related content. In the first subset, half the drawings depicted a child or a bird needing help to reach a simple goal. The other drawings depicted situations where the goal was achieved. The second subset showed adults either actively helping a child or as passive bystanders. We created control conditions by including pictures of the adults on their own. Participants were asked to report their affective responses to the stimuli using two types of 9-point scales. For one half of the pictures, scales of arousal (calm to excited) and of bipolar valence (unhappy to happy) were employed; for the other half, unipolar scales of pleasantness and unpleasantness (strong to absent) were used. RESULTS: Even non-dramatic depictions of simple need-of-help situations were rated systematically lower in valence, higher in arousal, less pleasant and more unpleasant than corresponding pictures with the child or bird not needing help. The presence of a child and adult together increased pleasantness ratings compared to pictures in which they were depicted alone. Arousal was lower for pictures showing only an adult than for those including a child. Depictions of active helping were rated similarly to pictures showing a passive adult bystander, when the need-of-help was resolved. Aggregated unipolar pleasantness and unpleasantness ratings accounted well for arousal and even better for bipolar valence ratings and for content effects on them. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to report upon the meaningful impact of harmless need-of-help content on self-reported emotional experience. It provides the basis for further investigating the links between subjective emotional experience and active prosocial behavior. It also builds upon recent findings on the correspondence between emotional ratings on bipolar and unipolar scales.
30776370<<>>Arousal<<>>Please be logical, I am in a bad mood: An electrophysiological study of mood effects on reasoning.<<>>Several behavioral studies have reported a detrimental effect of emotion on reasoning tasks, either when the content of the reasoning and/or the mood state of the individual are emotionally loaded. However, the neural mechanisms involved in this phenomena remain largely unexplored. In an event-related potentials (ERPs) study, we examined the consequences of an induced mood over the electrophysiological signals obtained while processing logical and illogical categorical conclusions. Prior to performing a syllogism reading task, we aimed to induce, by using short film clips, high arousal negative and positive moods and neutral affective states to participants in three separate recording sessions. Our mood induction procedure was only successful at inducing a highly arousing negative state. Behaviorally, participants committed more errors overall while judging the invalidity versus the validity of illogical and logical conclusions, respectively, but no influences from mood state emerged at this logical validity task. Electrophysiologically and overall a negative going N400 deflection was larger for illogical relative to logical conclusions in a parietal region between 300 and 420ms. However, further analysis revealed that the logical conclusions were only more expected (smaller N400 amplitudes) in the negative relative to the neutral and the positive sessions, providing support to theoretical views that posit that a more analytic reasoning style might be implemented under a negative mood state. These results provide further electrophysiological evidence of the influence of mood on other cognitive processes, particularly on the anticipation and processing of logical conclusions during online reasoning tasks.
29867408<<>>Arousal<<>>Post-error Brain Activity Correlates With Incidental Memory for Negative Words.<<>>The present study had three main objectives. First, we aimed to evaluate whether short-duration affective states induced by negative and positive words can lead to increased error-monitoring activity relative to a neutral task condition. Second, we intended to determine whether such an enhancement is limited to words of specific valence or is a general response to arousing material. Third, we wanted to assess whether post-error brain activity is associated with incidental memory for negative and/or positive words. Participants performed an emotional stop-signal task that required response inhibition to negative, positive or neutral nouns while EEG was recorded. Immediately after the completion of the task, they were instructed to recall as many of the presented words as they could in an unexpected free recall test. We observed significantly greater brain activity in the error-positivity (Pe) time window in both negative and positive trials. The error-related negativity amplitudes were comparable in both the neutral and emotional arousing trials, regardless of their valence. Regarding behavior, increased processing of emotional words was reflected in better incidental recall. Importantly, the memory performance for negative words was positively correlated with the Pe amplitude, particularly in the negative condition. The source localization analysis revealed that the subsequent memory recall for negative words was associated with widespread bilateral brain activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and in the medial frontal gyrus, which was registered in the Pe time window during negative trials. The present study has several important conclusions. First, it indicates that the emotional enhancement of error monitoring, as reflected by the Pe amplitude, may be induced by stimuli with symbolic, ontogenetically learned emotional significance. Second, it indicates that the emotion-related enhancement of the Pe occurs across both negative and positive conditions, thus it is preferentially driven by the arousal content of an affective stimuli. Third, our findings suggest that enhanced error monitoring and facilitated recall of negative words may both reflect responsivity to negative events. More speculatively, they can also indicate that post-error activity of the medial prefrontal cortex may selectively support encoding for negative stimuli and contribute to their privileged access to memory.
23524596<<>>Arousal<<>>Improving emotion recognition systems by embedding cardiorespiratory coupling.<<>>This work aims at showing improved performances of an emotion recognition system embedding information gathered from cardiorespiratory (CR) coupling. Here, we propose a novel methodology able to robustly identify up to 25 regions of a two-dimensional space model, namely the well-known circumplex model of affect (CMA). The novelty of embedding CR coupling information in an autonomic nervous system-based feature space better reveals the sympathetic activations upon emotional stimuli. A CR synchrogram analysis was used to quantify such a coupling in terms of number of heartbeats per respiratory period. Physiological data were gathered from 35 healthy subjects emotionally elicited by means of affective pictures of the international affective picture system database. In this study, we finely detected five levels of arousal and five levels of valence as well as the neutral state, whose combinations were used for identifying 25 different affective states in the CMA plane. We show that the inclusion of the bivariate CR measures in a previously developed system based only on monovariate measures of heart rate variability, respiration dynamics and electrodermal response dramatically increases the recognition accuracy of a quadratic discriminant classifier, obtaining more than 90% of correct classification per class. Finally, we propose a comprehensive description of the CR coupling during sympathetic elicitation adapting an existing theoretical nonlinear model with external driving. The theoretical idea behind this model is that the CR system is comprised of weakly coupled self-sustained oscillators that, when exposed to an external perturbation (i.e. sympathetic activity), becomes synchronized and less sensible to input variations. Given the demonstrated role of the CR coupling, this model can constitute a general tool which is easily embedded in other model-based emotion recognition systems.
26151968<<>>Arousal<<>>Ideal Affect: Cultural Causes and Behavioral Consequences.<<>>Most research focuses on actual affect, or the affective states that people actually feel. In this article, I demonstrate the importance and utility of studying ideal affect, or the affective states that people ideally want to feel. First, I define ideal affect and describe the cultural causes and behavioral consequences of ideal affect. To illustrate these points, I compare American and East Asian cultures, which differ in their valuation of high-arousal positive affective states (e.g., excitement, enthusiasm) and low-arousal positive affective states (e.g., calm, peace-fulness). I then introduce affect valuation theory, which integrates ideal affect with current models of affect and emotion and, in doing so, provides a new framework for understanding how cultural and temperamental factors may shape affect and behavior.
29367844<<>>Arousal<<>>Electroencephalography Amplitude Modulation Analysis for Automated Affective Tagging of Music Video Clips.<<>>The quantity of music content is rapidly increasing and automated affective tagging of music video clips can enable the development of intelligent retrieval, music recommendation, automatic playlist generators, and music browsing interfaces tuned to the users' current desires, preferences, or affective states. To achieve this goal, the field of affective computing has emerged, in particular the development of so-called affective brain-computer interfaces, which measure the user's affective state directly from measured brain waves using non-invasive tools, such as electroencephalography (EEG). Typically, conventional features extracted from the EEG signal have been used, such as frequency subband powers and/or inter-hemispheric power asymmetry indices. More recently, the coupling between EEG and peripheral physiological signals, such as the galvanic skin response (GSR), have also been proposed. Here, we show the importance of EEG amplitude modulations and propose several new features that measure the amplitude-amplitude cross-frequency coupling per EEG electrode, as well as linear and non-linear connections between multiple electrode pairs. When tested on a publicly available dataset of music video clips tagged with subjective affective ratings, support vector classifiers trained on the proposed features were shown to outperform those trained on conventional benchmark EEG features by as much as 6, 20, 8, and 7% for arousal, valence, dominance and liking, respectively. Moreover, fusion of the proposed features with EEG-GSR coupling features showed to be particularly useful for arousal (feature-level fusion) and liking (decision-level fusion) prediction. Together, these findings show the importance of the proposed features to characterize human affective states during music clip watching.
18981339<<>>Arousal<<>>Association of major depressive disorder with altered functional brain response during anticipation and processing of heat pain.<<>>CONTEXT: Chronic pain and depression are highly comorbid conditions, yet little is known about the neurobiological basis of pain processing in major depressive disorder (MDD). OBJECTIVE: To examine the neural substrates underlying anticipation and processing of heat pain in a group of unmedicated young adults with current MDD. DESIGN: Functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging data were collected during an event-related factorial experimental pain paradigm. Painful and nonpainful heat stimuli were applied to the left volar forearm while different color shapes explicitly signaled the intensity of the upcoming stimulus. SETTING: University brain imaging center. Patients Fifteen (12 female) young adults with current MDD and 15 (10 female) healthy subjects with no history of MDD were recruited and matched for age and level of education. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV was administered to all participants by a board-certified psychiatrist. Main Outcome Measure Between-group differences in blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging signal change to anticipation and processing of painful vs nonpainful temperature stimuli. RESULTS: Subjects with MDD compared with healthy controls showed (1) increased activation in the right anterior insular region, dorsal anterior cingulate, and right amygdala during anticipation of painful relative to nonpainful stimuli, (2) increased activation in the right amygdala and decreased activation in periaqueductal gray matter and the rostral anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices during painful stimulation relative to nonpainful stimulation, and (3) greater activation in the right amygdala during anticipation of pain, which was associated with greater levels of perceived helplessness. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that increased emotional reactivity during the anticipation of heat pain may lead to an impaired ability to modulate pain experience in MDD. Future studies should examine the degree to which altered functional brain response during anticipatory processing affects the ability to modulate negative affective states in MDD, which is a core characteristic of this disorder.
19837623<<>>Arousal<<>>Increased sensitivity to heat pain after sad mood induction in female patients with major depression.<<>>Patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) have been shown to exhibit increased thresholds towards experimentally induced thermal pain applied to the skin. In contrast, the induction of sad mood can increase pain perception in healthy controls. Here, we aimed to test the hypothesis that heat pain thresholds are further increased after sad mood induction in depressed patients. Thermal pain thresholds were obtained from 25 female depressed patients and 25 controls before and after sad mood induction applying a modified Velten Mood Induction procedure (MIP). Valence and arousal ratings were obtained using the self-assessment manikin. The Montgomery Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were obtained at baseline from all participants. Pain thresholds at baseline did not significantly differ between groups. Pain thresholds and valence of mood significantly decreased both in patients and controls, while arousal showed an inverse time course between groups. Therefore, our hypothesis could not be confirmed. From these data, we propose that the depressed mood as seen in MDD patients influences pain experience differently as compared to the shorter-lasting mood change after MIP. A differential interaction of both affective states with brain areas of the pain matrix might be assumed. Eventually, the induction of sad mood might mirror the increased number of pain complaints in depressed patients and thus adds to the current concept of adjuvant antidepressant treatment both in depressed patients with pain complaints and in chronic pain patients.
30209261<<>>Arousal<<>>Affective computing in virtual reality: emotion recognition from brain and heartbeat dynamics using wearable sensors.<<>>Affective Computing has emerged as an important field of study that aims to develop systems that can automatically recognize emotions. Up to the present, elicitation has been carried out with non-immersive stimuli. This study, on the other hand, aims to develop an emotion recognition system for affective states evoked through Immersive Virtual Environments. Four alternative virtual rooms were designed to elicit four possible arousal-valence combinations, as described in each quadrant of the Circumplex Model of Affects. An experiment involving the recording of the electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) of sixty participants was carried out. A set of features was extracted from these signals using various state-of-the-art metrics that quantify brain and cardiovascular linear and nonlinear dynamics, which were input into a Support Vector Machine classifier to predict the subject's arousal and valence perception. The model's accuracy was 75.00% along the arousal dimension and 71.21% along the valence dimension. Our findings validate the use of Immersive Virtual Environments to elicit and automatically recognize different emotional states from neural and cardiac dynamics; this development could have novel applications in fields as diverse as Architecture, Health, Education and Videogames.
25481666<<>>Arousal<<>>Dog behavior but not frontal brain reaction changes in repeated positive interactions with a human: a non-invasive pilot study using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).<<>>This study was conducted as a pilot test case to investigate potential behavioral and neural indicators of positive emotional states in dogs. These states were induced by subjecting each dog to three types of human interactions (verbal contact only, physical contact only, or both). Each stimulus was repeated 10 times, at 1-min intervals, alternating with a baseline phase (no interaction) while behavior was observed and frontal cortical brain activation was recorded by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Dogs reacted similarly to all 3 stimuli with a consistent hemodynamic pattern. Regarding behavior, dogs lay on their back, explored the handler and performed lip-licking more during exposure to the stimuli than during the baseline. There was only weak evidence that the dogs' behavioral reactions differed between the 3 stimuli, but their behavior changed markedly with repetition. For example, the proportion of time a dog spent lying with its head resting on the floor increased, whereas the probability of exploring the handler and the proportion of time spent lip-licking decreased over time. In contrast, the hemodynamic reaction did not change with repetition. The dogs' reactions are consistent with the stimuli being positive. The contrast between the changes in behavior with repetition and the consistency of the hemodynamic frontal cortical reaction would be in keeping with the assumption that there was a decrease in arousal as dogs habituated to the repetitions, reflected by their change in behavior, whereas because the valence of the stimuli remains constant, there was no change in the frontal hemodynamic reaction.
22575693<<>>Arousal<<>>Oscillations of heart rate and respiration synchronize during affective visual stimulation.<<>>The objective of this study is to investigate the synchronization between breathing patterns and heart rate during emotional visual elicitation, that is, using sets of images gathered from the international affective picture system having five levels of arousal and five levels of valence, including a neutral reference level. Thirty-five healthy volunteers were emotionally elicited in agreement with a bidimensional spatial localization of affective states, i.e., arousal/valence plane, while two peripheral physiological signals, ECG and Respiration activity, were acquired simultaneously. The synchronization was then quantified by applying the concept of phase synchronization of chaotic oscillators, i.e., the cardio-respiratory synchrogram. This technique allowed us to estimate the synchronization ratio m:n as the attendance of n heartbeats in each m respiratory cycle, even for noisy and nonstationary data. We found a stronger evidence of cardiorespiratory synchronization during arousal than during neutral states.
28914723<<>>Arousal<<>>Inducing Somatic Symptoms in Functional Syndrome Patients: Effects of Manipulating State Negative Affect.<<>>OBJECTIVE: Induction of negative affective states can enhance bodily symptoms in high habitual symptom reporters among healthy persons and in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The aims of this study were to replicate this effect in patients with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome and to investigate the role of moderators, focusing on alexithymia, negative affectivity, and absorption. METHODS: Patients with fibromyalgia and/or chronic fatigue syndrome (n = 81) and HCs (n = 41) viewed series of neutral, positive, and negative affective pictures. After every picture series, participants filled out a somatic symptom checklist and rated emotions experienced during the picture series on valence, arousal, and perceived control. RESULTS: Patients reported more somatic symptoms after viewing negative pictures (least square mean [LSM] = 19.40, standard error (SE) = 0.50) compared with neutral (LSM = 17.59, SE = 0.42, p < .001) or positive (LSM = 17.04, SE = 0.41, p < .001) pictures, whereas somatic symptom ratings of HCs after viewing negative picture series (LSM = 12.07, SE = 0.71) did not differ from ratings after viewing neutral (LSM = 11.07, SE = 0.59, p = .065) or positive (LSM = 11.10, SE = 0.58, p = .93) pictures. Negative affectivity did not moderate the symptom-enhancing effect of negative affective pictures, whereas the alexithymia factor "difficulty identifying feelings" and absorption did (p = .016 and p = .006, respectively). CONCLUSION: Negative affective states elicit elevated somatic symptom reports in patients experiencing fibromyalgia and/or chronic fatigue syndrome. This symptom-enhancing effect is greater in patients having higher difficulty to identify feelings and higher absorption scores. The results are discussed in a predictive coding framework of symptom perception.
20943936<<>>Arousal<<>>In the mood for adaptation: how affect regulates conflict-driven control.<<>>Cognitive conflict plays an important role in tuning cognitive control to the situation at hand. On the basis of earlier findings demonstrating emotional modulations of conflict processing, we predicted that affective states may adaptively regulate goal-directed behavior that is driven by conflict. We tested this hypothesis by measuring conflict-driven control adaptations following experimental induction of four different mood states that could be differentiated along the dimensions of arousal and pleasure. After mood states were induced, 91 subjects performed a flanker task, which provided a measure of conflict adaptation. As predicted, pleasure level affected conflict adaptation: Less pleasure was associated with more conflict-driven control. Arousal level did not influence conflict adaptation. This study suggests that affect adaptively regulates cognitive control. Implications for future research and psychopathology are discussed.
19515358<<>>Arousal<<>>Considerations for emotion-aware consumer products.<<>>Emotion-aware consumer products require reliable, short-term emotion assessment (i.e., unobtrusive, robust, and lacking calibration). To explore the feasibility of this, an experiment was conducted where the galvanic skin response (GSR) and three electromyography (EMG) signals (frontalis, corrugator supercilii, and zygomaticus major) were recorded on 24 participants who watched eight 2-min emotion inducing film fragments. The unfiltered psychophysiological signals were processed and six statistical parameters (i.e., mean, absolute deviation, standard deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis) were derived for each 10-s interval of the film fragment. For each physiological signal, skewness and kurtosis discriminated among affective states, accompanied by other parameters, depending on the signal. The skewness parameter also showed to indicate mixed emotions. Moreover, a mapping of events in the fragments on the signals showed the importance of short-term emotion assessment. Hence, this research identified generic features, denoted important considerations, and illustrated the feasibility of emotion-aware consumer products.
30358160<<>>Arousal<<>>Physicians' Interactions with Peers: Empathic Accuracy during Shift Handovers on Intensive-Care Units.<<>>BACKGROUND: We investigated how accurately physicians judge colleagues' states during shift handovers on intensive-care units, the role of physician characteristics, and how accuracy is related to handover partners' satisfaction. METHODS: Using mobile phones, we assessed momentary judgements during N = 272 shift handovers by 36 physicians of five Swiss clinics. Physicians rated their own and their partner's affective states. We calculated the covariation of the perceiver's judgements of the partner's affect with the partner's self-reported affect and the perceiver's own self-reported affect. We then examined the moderation of these covariations by physicians' roles and experience. RESULTS: Overall, resident physicians were moderately successful in taking their counterparts' perspective: Perceiver's ratings of partner's affect and the latter's self-ratings were significantly related. Associations between perceivers' ratings of their own and their partner's affect were also evident. None of the effects varied as a function of physicians' roles. There was an unexpected effect of job experience; physicians with more experience were more likely to project their own affect into the rating of partner's affect. Physicians' accuracy in judging the partner's tense arousal was related to the partner's satisfaction with the social interaction. This effect may have been mainly driven by instances in which low tension was accurately judged, however.
29293636<<>>Arousal<<>>Towards a more practical attention bias test to assess affective state in sheep.<<>>Tests for attention bias potentially offer more rapid assessment of affective state in animals than existing cognitive methods. An attention bias test has previously been developed for sheep and validated as a measure of anxious states. The 3 minute test assessed behavioural responses of sheep in an enclosed arena after brief exposure to the threat of a dog. Experiment 1 of the current study aimed to refine the previously developed method, removing the need for a habituation period and shortening the test duration. Sheep were given either an anxiolytic drug, an anxiogenic drug or a control treatment prior to testing to induce contrasting affective states. Differences in behaviour were found between the treatment groups within the first 45s of the test, indicating the original test duration could be shortened from 180 s. During testing, 36 of 40 animals in the control and anxiolytic groups ate the novel feed offered in the test, indicating it is not necessary to habituate animals to a feed container. Experiment 2 aimed to confirm the responses measured in the test were primarily towards the dog rather than other aspects of the test environment. Sheep exposed to an empty window at the beginning of the test behaved differently to those which were exposed to a dog, indicating sheep behaviour in the test is at least partially a response to the dog. A third group of sheep were also tested with the dog immediately after having small data loggers attached to their necks. Behaviour of these sheep did not differ from the sheep tested without loggers, indicating data logger attachment did not impact their behaviour in the test. In both experiments, treatments did not appear to modify activity (zones crossed), which we propose indicates the test was primarily detecting valence of the affective state rather than arousal.
28806742<<>>Arousal<<>>Dissociating maternal responses to sad and happy facial expressions of their own child: An fMRI study.<<>>BACKGROUND: Maternal sensitive behavior depends on recognizing one's own child's affective states. The present study investigated distinct and overlapping neural responses of mothers to sad and happy facial expressions of their own child (in comparison to facial expressions of an unfamiliar child). METHODS: We used functional MRI to measure dissociable and overlapping activation patterns in 27 healthy mothers in response to happy, neutral and sad facial expressions of their own school-aged child and a gender- and age-matched unfamiliar child. To investigate differential activation to sad compared to happy faces of one's own child, we used interaction contrasts. During the scan, mothers had to indicate the affect of the presented face. After scanning, they were asked to rate the perceived emotional arousal and valence levels for each face using a 7-point Likert-scale (adapted SAM version). RESULTS: While viewing their own child's sad faces, mothers showed activation in the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex whereas happy facial expressions of the own child elicited activation in the hippocampus. Conjoint activation in response to one's own child happy and sad expressions was found in the insula and the superior temporal gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal brain activations differed depending on the child's affective state. Sad faces of the own child activated areas commonly associated with a threat detection network, whereas happy faces activated reward related brain areas. Overlapping activation was found in empathy related networks. These distinct neural activation patterns might facilitate sensitive maternal behavior.
24109610<<>>Arousal<<>>Reconstruction and analysis of the pupil dilation signal: Application to a psychophysiological affective protocol.<<>>Pupil dilation (PD) dynamics reflect the interactions of sympathetic and parasympathetic innervations in the iris muscle. Different pupillary responses have been observed with respect to emotionally characterized stimuli. Evidences of the correlation between PD and respiration, heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure (BP) are present in literature, making the pupil dilation a candidate for estimating the activity state of the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS), in particular during stressful and/or emotionally characterized stimuli. The aim of this study is to investigate whether both slow and fast PD dynamics can be addressed to characterized different affective states. Two different frequency bands were considered: the classical autonomic band [0-0.45] Hz and a very high frequency (VHF) band [0.45-5] Hz. The pupil dilation signals from 13 normal subjects were recorded during a psychological protocol suitable to evoke particular affective states. An elaborate reconstruction of the missing data (blink events and artifacts) was performed to obtain a more reliable signal, particularly in the VHF band. Results show a high correlation between the arousal of the event and the power characteristics of the signal, in all frequencies. In particular, for the "Anger" condition, we can observe 10 indices out of 13 significantly different with respect to "Baseline" counterparts. These preliminary results suggest that both slow and fast oscillations of the PD can be used to characterize affective states.
27853532<<>>Arousal<<>>Alexithymia: a general deficit of interoception.<<>>Alexithymia is a sub-clinical construct, traditionally characterized by difficulties identifying and describing one's own emotions. Despite the clear need for interoception (interpreting physical signals from the body) when identifying one's own emotions, little research has focused on the selectivity of this impairment. While it was originally assumed that the interoceptive deficit in alexithymia is specific to emotion, recent evidence suggests that alexithymia may also be associated with difficulties perceiving some non-affective interoceptive signals, such as one's heart rate. It is therefore possible that the impairment experienced by those with alexithymia is common to all aspects of interoception, such as interpreting signals of hunger, arousal, proprioception, tiredness and temperature. In order to determine whether alexithymia is associated with selectively impaired affective interoception, or general interoceptive impairment, we investigated the association between alexithymia and self-reported non-affective interoceptive ability, and the extent to which individuals perceive similarity between affective and non-affective states (both measured using questionnaires developed for the purpose of the current study), in both typical individuals (n = 105 (89 female), mean age = 27.5 years) and individuals reporting a diagnosis of a psychiatric condition (n = 103 (83 female), mean age = 31.3 years). Findings indicated that alexithymia was associated with poor non-affective interoception and increased perceived similarity between affective and non-affective states, in both the typical and clinical populations. We therefore suggest that rather than being specifically associated with affective impairment, alexithymia is better characterized by a general failure of interoception.
19653774<<>>Arousal<<>>Effects of emotionally contagious films on changes in hemisphere-specific cognitive performance.<<>>In the framework of models on the lateralized involvement of the cortical hemispheres in affect and psychopathology, the authors examined whether cognitive processes associated with the left and the right prefrontal cortex varied as a function of valence, motivational direction, or intensity of induced mood. Affective states (cheerfulness, anxiety, sadness, anger, and neutral mood) were experimentally induced by short "emotionally contagious films." Findings confirmed that the newly developed films were suitable to effectively elicit the expected affective states and to differentially change the dimensions of interest. Changes in verbal versus figural fluency performance were examined as a function of positive versus negative valence, approach versus withdrawal motivation, and low versus high emotional arousal. Level of interest was evaluated as a control. Both the tendency to withdraw and emotional arousal seemed to produce relative advantages for cognitive processes that are more strongly represented in the right than left prefrontal cortex. Findings suggest that changes in cognitive performance might be best explained by an additive combination of motivational direction and arousal.
17683216<<>>Arousal<<>>On the origins of background emotions: from affect synchrony to symbolic expression.<<>>Guided by Damasio's (2003) formulations on background emotions, this study examined the contour of infant affect during interactions with mother and father in relation to the emergence of symbolic expression. One hundred parents and infants were observed in face-to-face interactions and in play sessions at the toddler stage. Parent's and infants' affective states were coded in 1-s frames, and synchrony was assessed. Toddlers' play was microcoded for symbolic level and for reciprocity and intrusiveness. Infant affective contour with mother was rhythmic with 1 episode of positive arousal framed by social gaze. Affective contour with father contained several peaks of positive arousal of shorter duration. Symbolic complexity was comparable and preserved the parent-specific contours, with quicker latencies, higher frequencies, and shorter durations of complex symbolic episodes with father. Sequential relations emerged between parent's and child's symbolic expression, and maternal reciprocity and intrusiveness were sequentially linked to symbolic expansion or constriction, respectively. Parent-infant synchrony and the parent's support of toddler symbolic play predicted symbolic complexity. The need to include time in research on emotions and the dyadic origins of positive emotions are discussed.
16712784<<>>Arousal<<>>Smoking motives in the prediction of affective vulnerability among young adult daily smokers.<<>>The primary aim of this study was to examine whether smoking to reduce negative affect was uniquely related to a range of affective vulnerability factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, anxious arousal, and negative affectivity) among daily smokers. Participants were 276 young adult daily smokers (124 females; M(age)=25.12, SD=10.37). Partially consistent with prediction, the motivation to smoke to reduce negative affect was significantly related to anxiety sensitivity and negative affectivity, but not anxious arousal; the observed significant effects were above and beyond other theoretically relevant factors (e.g., smoking rate, years smoked, age, gender). In contrast to prediction, habitual smoking motives demonstrated significant incremental associations with anxiety sensitivity and anxious arousal symptoms. These results suggest that there are important associations between certain smoking motives and negative affective states and that such relations are not attributable to other smoking factors (e.g., smoking rate).
28390445<<>>Arousal<<>>Peace of Mind, Academic Motivation, and Academic Achievement in Filipino High School Students.<<>>Recent literature has recognized the advantageous role of low-arousal positive affect such as feelings of peacefulness and internal harmony in collectivist cultures. However, limited research has explored the benefits of low-arousal affective states in the educational setting. The current study examined the link of peace of mind (PoM) to academic motivation (i.e., amotivation, controlled motivation, and autonomous motivation) and academic achievement among 525 Filipino high school students. Findings revealed that PoM was positively associated with academic achievement beta = .16, p < .05, autonomous motivation beta = .48, p < .001, and controlled motivation beta = .25, p < .01. As expected, PoM was negatively related to amotivation beta = -.19, p < .05, and autonomous motivation was positively associated with academic achievement beta = .52, p < .01. Furthermore, the results of bias-corrected bootstrap analyses at 95% confidence interval based on 5,000 bootstrapped resamples demonstrated that peace of mind had an indirect influence on academic achievement through the mediating effects of autonomous motivation. In terms of the effect sizes, the findings showed that PoM explained about 1% to 18% of the variance in academic achievement and motivation. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are elucidated.
25318539<<>>Arousal<<>>Let's dance--feel better! Mood changes following dancing in different situations.<<>>In the present study, we examined mood changes following dancing. Previous works suggested that contextual factors may influence affective states; it has been shown that changes in mood following competition differ from those following recreational exercise. The study has been conducted in Warsaw, Poland. Mood was assessed before and after dance activity in three groups of ballroom dancers: recreational (n = 32) and competitive (n = 38) dancers doing ordinary training and competitive dancers taking part in a dance competition (n = 35). We observed a moderately positive change in recreational dancers doing ordinary training; they reported higher energetic arousal (EA) and hedonic tone (HT) and lower tense arousal (TA) after dance activity. In comparison dancers taking part in a competition were higher on TA before dancing and felt less pleasure after dancing than recreational and competitive dancers doing ordinary training; HT, TA and EA moderately decreased during competition. In general, the current study suggests that dance can elicit changes in mood; however, situational context has to be taken into consideration when explaining the influence of dance on mood.
29486216<<>>Arousal<<>>Interoception sensitivity in the parental brain during the first months of parenting modulates children's somatic symptoms six years later: The role of oxytocin.<<>>Interoception, the perception and interpretation of one's own bodily signals, is a key aspect of human caregiving that impacts infant health and well-being across life. Interoception relies on limbic structures, mainly the amygdala, and the agranular visceromotor cortex, particularly the anterior insula (AI), that integrate with the oxytocin (OT) system to support interoceptive sensitivity. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine whether interoception sensitivity in the parent's brain during the first months of parenting combines with sensitive parenting and OT-system functionality to predict children's somatic symptoms six years later. We followed 45 primary-caregiving first-time mothers and fathers and their infants across the first six years of parenting. In infancy (Time 1), parents' brain response to infant stimuli was imaged, salivary OT measured, and parent-infant interactions coded for parent sensitivity. In preschool (Time 2), parent and child's OT and parent sensitivity were measured again. At six years (Time 3), parents reported on children's somatic symptoms. Greater activation of the parent's AI bilaterally when his/her child was an infant predicted lower child somatic problems at six years. Parent sensitivity partially mediated the links between parental AI activation and child somatic symptoms. In addition, greater parental bilateral amygdala activity predicted higher child OT levels at 3 years and parental OT moderated the relations between preschoolers' OT and later somatic symptoms. Our findings chart two independent cross-generational pathways from interoception sensitivity in the parent's brain and child somatization. The first defines an evolutionary-ancient path including the amygdala and the OT system that support mammalian attention to arousal modulations in response to social cues; the second, via the AI, implicates higher-order interoceptive representations of bodily responses and affective states that underpins human embodiment.
10784286<<>>Arousal<<>>Using the Job-Related Affective Well-Being Scale (JAWS) to investigate affective responses to work stressors.<<>>Prior research linking job stressors to psychological strains has been limited to a small number of emotional reactions. This article describes research linking job stressors to a wide range of affective states at work. In Study 1, a multidimensional scaling procedure was used on a matrix of similarity judgments by 51 employees of 56 job-related affective statements to support a 2-dimensional view of affective well-being. In Study 2, ratings of the affect statements by 100 employees further supported the contention that the dimensions were pleasure-displeasure and degree of arousal. In Study 3, 114 full-time university employees responded to the Job-Related Affective Well-Being Scale, which was found to be related to measures of job stressors as well as job satisfaction and physical symptoms.
11321635<<>>Arousal<<>>A dynamical systems interpretation of a dimensional model of emotion.<<>>The dimensional structure of emotion was investigated using self reports of induced mood and idiographic and nomothetic analyses. Subjects attended four experimental sessions during which an array of affective states was induced via auditory, visual, and imaginal channels. For each of 118 stimulus events, subjects self-rated their response. Factor analysis yielded the predicted bipolar factors of valence and arousal: these were obtained in group-aggregated analysis and subsequently confirmed as change dimensions at the intraindividual level. Controversy over the fundamental dimensions of affective space was considered with respect to methodological issues such as factor rotation and sampling of data space. Valence and arousal are discussed as motivational, driving parameters of affective experience and a dynamical systems conceptualization of emotion is proposed.
12820858<<>>Arousal<<>>Modulation of spinal reflexes by aversive and sexually appetitive stimuli.<<>>In this study, modulation of spinal tendinous (T) reflexes by sexual stimulation was investigated. T reflexes are augmented in states of appetitive and defensive action and modified by differences in arousal intensity. Reflexes were expected to be facilitated by both pleasant (sexual) and unpleasant (anxiety) stimuli. Subjects were exposed to a sexual, an anxiety-inducing, a sexually threatening, and a neutral film excerpt. Genital arousal, emotional experience, subjective action tendencies, and T reflexes were monitored. Self-report and genital data confirmed the affective states as intended. T reflex amplitude significantly increased during viewing of emotionally arousing film excerpts as compared with a neutral film excerpt. T reflexes were facilitated by the sex stimulus to the same extent as by the anxiety and sexual threat stimuli. The results support the view of sexual arousal as an emotional state, generating sex-specific autonomic and general somatic motor system responses, which prepare the organism for action.
11190792<<>>Arousal<<>>Affective and metabolic responses to hypnosis, autogenic relaxation, and quiet rest in the supine and seated positions.<<>>This study examined the influence of hypnosis, autogenic relaxation, and quiet rest on selected affective states and metabolism. The influence of body position (seated vs. supine) on these same outcome measures was also investigated. Anxiety, tension, and overall mood were assessed before and 30 minutes after each treatment, and oxygen uptake was measured continuously. State anxiety, tension, and a general measure of mood were reduced significantly following each intervention, but oxygen uptake did not change with the exception of small, transient alterations during the physical challenges performed in the hypnosis condition. It is concluded that administration of a routine hypnosis induction to healthy individuals results in a reduction of state anxiety and an improvement of mood commensurate with effects achieved by autogenic training and quiet rest, and these effects occur in both the supine and seated position.
7436693<<>>Arousal<<>>Female sexual response patterns. Interactions of physiological, affective, and contextual cues.<<>>This study examined physiological, affective, and contextual components of female sexual responsiveness and satisfaction. Fifty-five women, aged 21 to 58, 27 of whom were married participated in two psychophysiological laboratory sessions and completed a questionnaire. During each laboratory session, physiological and self-reported sexual arousal were measured in response to an erotic tape, film, and self-generated fantasies. Vaginal pulse amplitude responses showed married women to be less aroused to erotic materials during session 1 but not session 2. Self-reported sexual arousal was correlated with vaginal response only in the unmarried sample and only during the tape and film of session 1. Subjectively reported sexual arousal was also correlated with a constellation of positive affective states. Generally, negative correlations were found between vaginal response in the laboratory and reported sexual responsiveness at home. The patterning of the affective-physiological relationships suggests several interpretations with regard to female sexuality and models to human emotion.
6683315<<>>Arousal<<>>Affective and physiological sexual response patterns: the effects of instructions on sexually functional and dysfunctional men.<<>>To more clearly characterize the patterns of cognitive-affective and physiological responses concomitant with male sexual dysfunction, the present study compared 14 sexually dysfunctional and 16 sexually functional men. All individuals listened to two sexually explicit tapes and engaged in a self-generated fantasy, while genital, heart rate and scaled cognitive affective responses were recorded. Two types of instructions, a performance demand set and a non-demand sensate focus set, preceded the erotic tapes in counterbalanced order. As predicted, dysfunctional men showed less genital tumescence to tapes preceded by the demand than the non-demand instructions. Contrary to expectation, functional men showed greater penile tumescence to the tapes preceded by demand instructions. Self-reported sexual arousal did not follow the penile tumescence pattern but instead indicated that the dysfunctional sample was significantly less subjectively aroused to the tapes and fantasy. There were other significant differences between the groups. Dysfunctional men showed greater general psychological distress, as measured by the SCL-90, including elevated somaticism, anxiety and depression scores. During the experimental session, dysfunctional men also evidenced greater awareness of a variety of physiological responses, as well as more negative and fewer positive cognitive-affective states. These data are discussed in terms of the interaction of affective and physiological responses, differences in contextual meanings of instructional sets given the presence of a dysfunction, and theoretical and clinical conceptualizations of male sexual functioning.
6746917<<>>Arousal<<>>The Multiple Affect Adjective Check List: subscale intercorrelations from two independent studies.<<>>Found the MAACL, the Anxiety, Depression and Hostility subscales to be intercorrelated in two independent studies (N = 84), thus raising doubts about their validity as measures of separate affective states. It is suggested that the scores of the subscales may usefully be summed to produce a measure of general negative affect.
20461804<<>>Arousal<<>>Compulsive use of dopaminergic drug therapy in Parkinson's disease: reward and anti-reward.<<>>A few Parkinson patients develop a disabling pattern of compulsive dopaminergic drug use ("dopamine dysregulation syndrome"-DDS). DDS patients commonly identify aversive dysphoric "OFF" mood-states as a primary motivation to compulsively use their drugs. We compared motoric, affective, non-motor symptoms and incentive arousal after overnight medication withdrawal and after levodopa in DDS and control PD patients. Twenty DDS patients were matched to 20 control PD patients for age, gender, and disease duration and underwent a standard levodopa challenge. Somatic symptomatology, positive and negative affective states, drug effects, reward responsivity, motor disability, and dyskinesias were tested in the "OFF"-state after overnight withdrawal of medications, and then after a challenge with a standard dose of levodopa, after a full "ON"-state was achieved. In the "OFF"-state, DDS patients reported lower positive affect, and more motor and non-motor disability. In the "ON"-state, DDS patients had higher expressions of drug "wanting," reward responsivity, and dyskinesias. Positive and negative affect, non-motor symptomatology, and motor disability were comparable. These findings suggest that affective, motivational, and motoric disturbances in PD are associated with the transition to compulsive drug use in individuals who inappropriately overuse their dopaminergic medication.
18436386<<>>Arousal<<>>Effects of cocaine place conditioning, chronic escalating-dose "binge" pattern cocaine administration and acute withdrawal on orexin/hypocretin and preprodynorphin gene expressions in lateral hypothalamus of Fischer and Sprague-Dawley rats.<<>>Recent evidence suggests an important role for hypothalamic orexins/hypocretins in modulation of drug reward and addiction-like behaviors in rodents. Our recent study has shown that the aversive state of arousal during acute morphine withdrawal is associated with increased orexin gene expression in lateral hypothalamus (LH) of Fischer 344 (F344) inbred rats, with no change in the expression of preprodynorphin (ppDyn), a gene co-expressed with LH orexin. Therefore, we determined whether orexin and ppDyn mRNA levels in LH or medial hypothalamus (including perifornical and dorsomedial areas) of F344 or Sprague-Dawley (SD) outbred rats, are altered following: 1) cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) conditioned place preference (CPP); 2) chronic (14 days) cocaine exposure using both "binge" pattern administration in steady-dose (45 mg/kg/day) and escalating-dose (45-90 mg/kg/day) regimens; and 3) acute (1 day) and chronic (14 days) withdrawal from cocaine with opioid receptor antagonist naloxone treatment (1 mg/kg). We found that orexin mRNA levels were decreased after cocaine place conditioning in the LH of SD rats. A decreased LH orexin mRNA level was also observed after chronic escalating-dose cocaine (but not CPP pattern regimen without conditioning, or steady-dose regimen) in both strains. In F344 rats only, acute withdrawal from chronic escalating-dose cocaine administration resulted in increases in both LH orexin and ppDyn mRNA levels, which were unaltered by naloxone or after chronic withdrawal. Our results suggest that (1) alteration of LH orexin gene expression is region-specific after cocaine place conditioning in SD rats and dose-dependent after chronic exposure in both strains; and (2) increased LH orexin and ppDyn gene expressions in F344 rats may contribute to negative affective states in cocaine withdrawal.
27065116<<>>Arousal<<>>INVITED REVIEW: The usefulness of measuring glucocorticoids for assessing animal welfare.<<>>Glucocorticoids (corticosterone in birds and rodents and cortisol in all other mammals) are glucoregulatory hormones that are synthesized in response to a range of stimuli including stress and are regularly measured in the assessment of animal welfare. Glucocorticoids have many normal or non-stress-related functions, and glucocorticoid synthesis can increase in response to pleasure, excitement, and arousal as well as fear, anxiety, and pain. Often, when assessing animal welfare, little consideration is given to normal non-stress-related glucocorticoid functions or the complex mechanisms that regulate the effects of glucocorticoids on physiology. In addition, it is rarely acknowledged that increased glucocorticoid synthesis can indicate positive welfare states or that a stress response can increase fitness and improve the welfare of an animal. In this paper, we review how and when glucocorticoid synthesis increases, the actions mediated through type I and type II glucocorticoid receptors, the importance of corticosteroid-binding globulin, the role of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and the key aspects of neurophysiology relevant to activating the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. This is discussed in the context of animal welfare assessment, particularly under the biological functioning and affective states frameworks. We contend that extending the assessment of animal welfare to key brain regions afferent to the hypothalamus and incorporating the aspects of glucocorticoid physiology that affect change in target tissue will advance animal welfare science and inspire more comprehensive assessment of the welfare of animals.
26888312<<>>Arousal<<>>Feasibility and Effects of a Brief Compassion-Focused Imagery Intervention in Psychotic Patients with Paranoid Ideation: A Randomized Experimental Pilot Study.<<>>Paranoia is characterized by a lack of perceived social safeness and associated negative affect. Low self-esteem, negative self-concepts and negative emotions have been shown to contribute to paranoid symptom formation. Thus, interventions focusing on affiliation and positive affect might be particularly helpful for patients with paranoia. The present study experimentally tested the effect of a one-session, brief compassion-focused imagery derived from Compassion-Focused Therapy (Gilbert, ) versus a control imagery condition in a repeated measures randomized design. A negative affective state was induced via in-sensu exposure to a recent distressful social situation in order to provide a minimum level of threat-related arousal to be down-regulated by the interventions thereafter. The sample consisted of psychotic patients with paranoid ideation (N = 51) who were randomly assigned to one of the experimental conditions. Effects on postulated causal mechanisms, i.e., self-relating (self-reassurance, self-compassion, self-criticism), and affect (self-reported affective states, skin conductance levels) as well as on state paranoia, were tested. Subjective benefit and appraisals of the intervention were explored. There were no specific intervention effects on negative self-relating, negative affect and skin-conductance or on paranoia. However, compassion-focused imagery had significant effects on self-reassurance and happiness. Explorative analyses revealed that the majority of the participants appraised the intervention in a positive manner, indicating good acceptance. The intervention showed an effect on some of the postulated mechanisms but not on others, which might have been because of its brevity. Further investigation of interventions targeting affiliation for people with paranoid experiences appears worthwhile. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: Affiliative imagery work is feasible and appraised positively in psychotic patients. Brief compassion focused imagery increased feelings of happiness and reassurance but did not improve negative self-relating, negative affect or paranoia. Further investigation is warranted to identify which patients benefit most from affiliative imagery.
8476406<<>>Arousal<<>>Identification of trichotillomania cue profiles.<<>>To explore the usefulness of emotional and environmental cues in distinguishing different patterns and potential subtypes of hair pulling in trichotillomania, we looked at the responses of 75 chronic hair pullers who had identified relevant cues for hair pulling from a 339 item list. Principal components analysis suggested two independent components which were important to hair pulling, one distinguished by negative affective states (NA), and the other by sedentary activities and contemplative attitudes (S). High NA scores were related to hair pulling which was the focus of the Ss' attention, as well as with increased prevalence of lifetime obsessive compulsive disorder, other anxiety disorders, current and past depression, and obsessive compulsive personality disorder. High SA scores were related to a history of major depression only. Weighted scores on these components may be useful in further elaborating the phenomenology of trichotillomania and designing appropriate treatment interventions.
14596717<<>>Arousal<<>>The affective beneficence of vigorous exercise revisited.<<>>OBJECTIVES: High exercise intensity may be associated with reduced adherence to exercise programmes, possibly because it is perceived as aversive. However, several authors have suggested that an intensity as high as 60% or 70% of maximal aerobic capacity (VO(2max)) is necessary for exercise to elicit positive affective changes. To elucidate this discrepancy, the affective responses to increasing levels of exercise intensity were examined. DESIGN: In total, 30 volunteers rated their affect every minute as they ran on a treadmill while the speed and grade were progressively increased. METHOD: The methodology was unique in three respects: (1) affect was assessed in terms of the dimensions of the circumplex model instead of distinct affective states, (2) affect was assessed repeatedly before, during, and after exercise, not only before and after, and (3) exercise intensity was standardized across participants in terms of metabolically comparable phases (beginning, ventilatory threshold, VO(2max)) instead of percentages of maximal capacity. RESULTS: Pre-to-post-exercise comparisons indicated affective benefits in the form of increased energetic arousal and decreased tense arousal. During exercise, however, affective valence deteriorated beyond the ventilatory threshold and until VO(2max), a trend that reversed itself instantaneously during cool-down. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise intensity that requires a transition to anaerobic metabolism can have a transient but substantial negative impact on affect and this may, in turn, reduce adherence to exercise programmes.
3405720<<>>Arousal<<>>Cognitive organization of emotion: differences between labels and descriptors of emotion in jealousy situations.<<>>The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether the cognitive organization of labels of emotion differs from descriptions of affective states. This was done in the context of determining whether the attributions of labels of emotion and descriptions of affective responses in jealousy situations differed according to the status of the interloper, presence of an audience to the untoward behavior, and sex of the respondent. The subjects, 300 male and female junior college students, read vignettes which placed them at a party where their mates passionately kissed interlopers of varying status, and whose transgressions were, or were not, observed by others. The subjects were required to indicate the likelihood that they would experience anger, disgust, fear, jealousy, sadness, and surprise, and 49 cognitive and physiological descriptions of the affective states referred to by the aforementioned labels of emotion. Different findings were obtained with the labels and descriptors of affective states. This was interpreted as support for the systems theory of G.E. Schwartz. The descriptions, but not the labels, indicated that men were most upset when the interloper was a best friend and least concerned when he was a stranger. In contrast, women were most upset when the interloper was someone of equal or lower status than themselves and least upset when the interloper was their best friend.
21241736<<>>Arousal<<>>Affective neuroscientific and neuropsychoanalytic approaches to two intractable psychiatric problems: why depression feels so bad and what addicts really want.<<>>The affective foundations of depression and addictions are discussed from a cross-species - animal to human - perspective of translational psychiatric research. Depression is hypothesized to arise from an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to terminate protracted activation of separation-distress (PANIC/GRIEF) systems of the brain, a shutdown mechanism which may be in part mediated by down-regulation of dopamine based reward-SEEKING resources. This shutdown of the brain's core motivational machinery is organized by shifts in multiple peptide systems, particularly increased dynorphin (kappa opioids). Addictions are conceived to be primarily mediated by obsessive behaviors sustained by reward-SEEKING circuits in the case of psychostimulant abuse, and also powerful consummatory-PLEASURE responses in the case of opioid abuse, which in turn capture SEEKING circuits. Both forms of addiction, as well as others, eventually deplete reward-SEEKING resources, leading to a state of dysphoria which can only temporarily be reversed by drugs of abuse, thereby promoting a negative affect that sustains addictive cycles. In other words, the opponent affective process - the dysphoria of diminished SEEKING resources - that can be aroused by sustained over-arousal of separation-distress (PANIC/GRIEF) as well as direct pharmacological over-stimulation and depletion of SEEKING resources, may be a common denominator for the genesis of both depression and addiction. Envisioning the foundation of such psychiatric problems as being in imbalances of the basic mammalian emotional systems that engender prototype affective states may provide more robust translational research strategies, coordinated with, rather than simply focusing on, the underlying molecular dynamics. Emotional vocalizations might be one of the best ways to monitor the underlying affective dynamics in commonly used rodent models of psychiatric disorders.
10576474<<>>Arousal<<>>Cardiovascular changes during induced emotion: an application of lang's theory of emotional imagery.<<>>Studies of emotion have provided occasional support for physiological differentiation of affective states; however, the evidence has been inconsistent. The aims of the present study were to investigate cardiovascular changes associated with relived experiences of happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust and to examine the utility of methods designed to optimize the induction of emotional responses. Thirty-four undergraduates who scored 0.5 sd above the mean on Larsen and Diener's Affect Intensity Measure described their most intense experiences of five emotions. These descriptions were then used to induce those emotions while blood pressure and other hemodynamic measures were monitored. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and stroke volume differentiated among emotions. The results support the suggestion that cardiovascular activity differentiates emotional states and provide some insight into the physiological adjustments subserving such effects. The study demonstrates a method that may be applied to studies of discrete emotions.
9565714<<>>Arousal<<>>Anxiety and depression in patients receiving implanted cardioverter-defibrillators: a longitudinal investigation.<<>>OBJECTIVE: The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) has dramatically improved survival rates following sudden cardiac death episodes. However, researchers have devoted little attention to the psychosocial consequences of living with the device. The current study used a longitudinal design to evaluate the impact of adaptation to the ICD on incidence and severity of anxiety and depression. METHOD: ICD recipients were administered standardized anxiety and depression questionnaires as well as questions evaluating quality of life related to the ICD in two consecutive yearly assessments. A preliminary evaluation of potentially important theoretical variables, such as the perceived predictability and controllability of shock onset was also conducted. RESULTS: One-third of the study population (N = 38) had clinically significant levels of anxiety, depressed mood, and fear of symptoms of autonomic arousal. These negative affective states persisted over time, with 40 to 63 percent of subjects continuing to have ongoing difficulties over a one-year time period. Anxiety about the ICD firing was closely associated with the occurrence of depression, while avoidance of activities was associated with anxiety. "Worry" about the ICD and a belief that ICD firing can be predicted were associated with anxiety sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive and anxiety states in ICD recipients may be frequent, clinically significant, and resistant to spontaneous resolution. Early signs of anxiety and depression in ICD recipients should be evaluated. Implications for future research are discussed.
24045586<<>>Arousal<<>>Meclizine enhancement of sensorimotor gating in healthy male subjects with high startle responses and low prepulse inhibition.<<>>Histamine H1 receptor systems have been shown in animal studies to have important roles in the reversal of sensorimotor gating deficits, as measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI). H1-antagonist treatment attenuates the PPI impairments caused by either blockade of NMDA glutamate receptors or facilitation of dopamine transmission. The current experiment brought the investigation of H1 effects on sensorimotor gating to human studies. The effects of the histamine H1 antagonist meclizine on the startle response and PPI were investigated in healthy male subjects with high baseline startle responses and low PPI levels. Meclizine was administered to participants (n=24) using a within-subjects design with each participant receiving 0, 12.5, and 25 mg of meclizine in a counterbalanced order. Startle response, PPI, heart rate response, galvanic skin response, and changes in self-report ratings of alertness levels and affective states (arousal and valence) were assessed. When compared with the control (placebo) condition, the two doses of meclizine analyzed (12.5 and 25 mg) produced significant increases in PPI without affecting the magnitude of the startle response or other physiological variables. Meclizine also caused a significant increase in overall self-reported arousal levels, which was not correlated with the observed increase in PPI. These results are in agreement with previous reports in the animal literature and suggest that H1 antagonists may have beneficial effects in the treatment of subjects with compromised sensorimotor gating and enhanced motor responses to sensory stimuli.
14986839<<>>Arousal<<>>Emotional perception and neuroendocrine changes.<<>>The present study was designed to investigate the neuroendocrine modifications during affective states. In particular, we investigate if the pleasantness of the stimuli has a different effect on neuroendocrine responses. To address this issue, we compared the effects of pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant pictures on catecholamine, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and prolactin plasma levels. Ten male participants were submitted to three experimental sessions, each on one of the three experimental days, a week apart in a counterbalanced order. Although in the subjective arousal rating, pleasant (erotic pictures) and unpleasant stimuli (pictures of mutilated bodies) receive the same high score, a different neuroendocrine pattern was obtained: unpleasant stimuli elicited a decrease in prolactin concentration and increases in noradrenaline, cortisol, and ACTH levels, whereas pleasant slide set viewing induced an increase in prolactin levels. The results suggest that the neuroendocrine system responds selectively to affective motivationally relevant pictures.
3625594<<>>Arousal<<>>Effects of induced hyperventilation on electrodermal response habituation to agoraphobia-relevant stimuli.<<>>The role of hyperventilation in the aetiology of anxiety disorders was investigated in an analogue study. It was hypothesised that induced hyperventilation would alter subsequent subjective and physiological responses to visually presented agoraphobic material. Three groups (N = 16) of students were used and each was divided into two sub-groups which were presented with slides of either potentially agoraphobic or neutral content. During the first phase of the experiment, subjects were exposed to 10 slides whilst their breathing rate was manipulated. Group FB was instructed to hyperventilate by asking the subjects to breathe fast and deeply, Group SB was instructed to breathe at a slow rate and Group NB breathed normally. After a recovery phase, subjects were re-exposed to the same visual stimuli as used in the first phase of the experiment. Measures of skin conductance response amplitude were obtained for each stimulus in the series. In addition, heart rate and respiration were monitored, and subjective measures of somatic and affective states were obtained. Subjects also rated the pleasantness of the stimuli. The hyperventilation instructions resulted in delayed electrodermal habituation relative to the other groups. This finding could not be accounted for in terms of group differences in either physiological or subjective 'arousal'.
8434658<<>>Arousal<<>>Aging, emotional states, and memory.<<>>OBJECTIVE: This study compared the relation between negative mood states and memory in young and elderly subjects. METHOD: Forty-five normal, healthy young volunteers (ages 19-35 years) and 45 normal, healthy elderly volunteers (ages 60-78 years) were administered a verbal list-learning task and self-rated scales of affective states. RESULTS: The elderly group, but not the young group, consistently exhibited significant correlations between their performance on verbal recall measures and their ratings of their anxiety, depression, and withdrawal; i.e., within the elderly group, higher levels of negative affective states were associated with poorer memory. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that aging modulates the relation between emotional state and memory functions, and they are consistent with the hypothesis that the elderly are more vulnerable than the young to the adverse effects of negative emotional states on memory. Therefore, even in normal elderly individuals without diagnosable psychopathology, negative affective states (such as anxiety and depression) may interfere with memory functioning.
15734365<<>>Arousal<<>>Viewing facial expressions of pain engages cortical areas involved in the direct experience of pain.<<>>Recent neuroimaging and neuropsychological work has begun to shed light on how the brain responds to the viewing of facial expressions of emotion. However, one important category of facial expression that has not been studied on this level is the facial expression of pain. We investigated the neural response to pain expressions by performing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as subjects viewed short video sequences showing faces expressing either moderate pain or, for comparison, no pain. In alternate blocks, the same subjects received both painful and non-painful thermal stimulation. Facial expressions of pain were found to engage cortical areas also engaged by the first-hand experience of pain, including anterior cingulate cortex and insula. The reported findings corroborate other work in which the neural response to witnessed pain has been examined from other perspectives. In addition, they lend support to the idea that common neural substrates are involved in representing one's own and others' affective states.
24513877<<>>Arousal<<>>Affective and inflammatory responses among orchestra musicians in performance situation.<<>>A number of studies have shown that mental challenge under controlled experimental conditions is associated with elevations in inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP). However, relatively little work has been done on the effects of 'naturalistic' stressors on acute changes in inflammatory markers. The present study examined whether perceived arousal, valence and dominance in musicians are associated with pro-inflammatory and oxidative responses to a concert situation. Blood and salivary samples obtained from 48 members of a symphony orchestra on the day of rehearsal (i.e., control situation) and on the following day of premiere concert (i.e., test situation) were used to determine changes in salivary cortisol, pro-inflammatory markers (plasma myeloperoxidase, serum CRP, plasma IL-6), oxidative stress markers (paraoxonase1 activity and malondialdehyde), and homocysteine, a risk factor for vascular disease. Results of regression analyses showed a significant trend to increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) response in individuals with low valence score. Both affective states, valence and arousal, were identified as significant predictors of cortisol response during concert. In addition, control levels of plasma malondialdehyde were positively correlated with differences in IL-6 levels between premiere and rehearsal (r=.38, p=.012), pointing to higher oxidative stress in individuals with pronounced IL-6 response. Our results indicate that stress of public performance leads to increased concentrations of plasma MPO (20%), IL-6 (27%) and salivary cortisol (44%) in musicians. The decreasing effect of pleasantness on the MPO response was highly pronounced in non-smokers (r=-.60, p<.001), suggesting a significant role of emotional valence in stress-induced secretion of MPO. Additional studies are needed to assess the generalizability of these findings to other 'naturalistic' stress situations.
17845113<<>>Arousal<<>>The influence of state and trait affect on HIV risk behaviors: a daily diary study of MSM.<<>>OBJECTIVE: To characterize the influence of state and trait affect on HIV risk behaviors. DESIGN: Men who have sex with men (N = 155) completed reports of trait affect and daily reports of affect and sexual behaviors each night for up to 30 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Analyses focused on the role of state and trait positive activation (PA), negative activation (NA), anxious arousal (AA), and sexual activation (SA) on sexual risk taking, operationalized as having a sex partner, a partner-related risk composite, and an HIV risk behavior composite. RESULTS: State SA was positively associated with having a sex partner and HIV risk behaviors; trait SA was positively associated with partner-related risk. State AA was negatively associated with having a sex partner and positively associated with HIV risk behaviors. Trait AA had a negative association with partner-related risk and moderated the effects of state AA. State PA was negatively associated with HIV risk behaviors, and trait PA had a main effect on having a sex partner. NA had no significant trait or state effects. CONCLUSION: These data suggest a role for multiple affective states in sexual risk taking. Models of HIV risk-taking behaviors should be extended to include affective processes.
9203109<<>>Arousal<<>>Self-injurious behavior and mood regulation in borderline patients.<<>>This article explores the hypothesis that self-injurious behavior (SIB) of the type associated with borderline personality disorder (BPD) has an important mood regulatory function. Thirty-eight female inpatients with an Axis II diagnosis of BPD and a history of SIB rated a variety of mood and affective states, using visual analog scales recalled over the course of usual SIB experiences. Subjects were additionally divided into two groups according to whether they typically experience pain during SIB (BPD-P group) or did not (BPD-NP group). For both groups, the visual analog scale ratings revealed significant mood elevation and decreased dissociation following self injury, with a peak in dissociative symptoms during self injury. The ratings of dissociative symptoms were found to be higher in the BPD-NP group when compared to the BPD-P group across all stages of SIB. The ratings of sexual arousal did not change over the course of SIB for either group. These findings are discussed in light of current knowledge of the relationship between SIB and mood.
17312321<<>>Arousal<<>>Good feelings in christianity and buddhism: religious differences in ideal affect.<<>>Affect valuation theory (AVT) predicts cultural variation in the affective states that people ideally want to feel (i.e., "ideal affect"). National and ethnic comparisons support this prediction: For instance, European Americans (EA) value high arousal positive (HAP) states (e.g., excitement) more and low arousal positive (LAP) states (e.g., calm) less than Hong Kong Chinese. In this article, the authors examine whether religions differ in the ideal affective states they endorse. The authors predicted that Christianity values HAP more and LAP less than Buddhism. In Study 1, they compared Christian and Buddhist practitioners' ideal affect. In Studies 2 and 3, they compared the endorsement of HAP and LAP in Christian and Buddhist classical texts (e.g., Gospels, Lotus Sutra) and contemporary self-help books (e.g., Your Best Life Now, Art of Happiness). Findings supported predictions, suggesting that AVT applies to religious and to national and ethnic cultures.
20980710<<>>Arousal<<>>Momentary affect predicts bodily movement in daily life: an ambulatory monitoring study.<<>>There is converging evidence that physical activity influences affective states. It has been found that aerobic exercise programs can significantly diminish negative affect. Moreover, among healthy individuals, moderate levels of physical activity seem to increase energetic arousal and positive affect. However, the predictive utility of affective states for bodily movement has rarely been investigated. In this study, we examined whether momentarily assessed affect is associated with bodily movement in everyday life. Using a previously published data set (Schwerdtfeger, Eberhardt, & Chmitorz, 2008), we reanalyzed 12-hr ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data from 124 healthy volunteers. Electronic momentary positive-activated affect (EMA-PAA) and negative affect (EMA-NA) were assessed via handheld computers, and bodily movement was recorded via accelerosensors. Generalized linear mixed models were calculated. Results indicated that EMAPAA increases were accompanied by bodily movement increases of varying intensity. EMA-NA was also positively associated with increases in certain kinds of bodily movement. In light of previous research, this finding suggests that affect and bodily movement may have circular effects on each other.
2005271<<>>Arousal<<>>Affective individual differences and startle reflex modulation.<<>>Potentiation of startle has been demonstrated in experimentally produced aversive emotional states, and clinical reports suggest that potentiated startle may be associated with fear or anxiety. To test the generalizability of startle potentiation across a variety of emotional states as well as its sensitivity to individual differences in fearfulness, the acoustic startle response of 17 high- and 15 low-fear adult subjects was assessed during fear, anger, joy, sadness, pleasant relaxation, and neutral imagery. Startle responses were larger in all aversive affective states than during pleasant imagery. This effect was enhanced among high fear subjects, although followup testing indicated that other affective individual differences (depression and anger) may also be related to increased potentiation of startle in negative affect. Startle latency was reduced during high- rather than low-arousal imagery but was unaffected by emotional valence.
2667692<<>>Arousal<<>>Perception, cognition and action: the mediating role of affective states.<<>>When facing and evaluating the present state of the world, the brain generates predictions and expectancies together with some specific emotional state which imposes on any given situation - or rather on the individual relationship to that situation - its essential meaning that basically orients the choice of an appropriate behavioural strategy. This general notion is exemplified by concrete data concerning brain mechanisms which underlie aggressive behaviour.
21605608<<>>Arousal<<>>Caffeine ingestion, affect and perceived exertion during prolonged cycling.<<>>Caffeine's metabolic and performance effects have been widely reported. However, caffeine's effects on affective states during prolonged exercise are unknown. Therefore, this was examined in the present study. Following an overnight fast and in a randomised, double-blind, counterbalanced design, twelve endurance trained male cyclists performed 90 min of exercise at 70% VO((2) max) 1h after ingesting 6 mg kg(-)(1) BM of caffeine (CAF) or placebo (PLA). Dimensions of affect and perceived exertion were assessed at regular intervals. During exercise, pleasure ratings were better maintained (F((3),(3)(8))=4.99, P < 0.05) in the CAF trial compared to the PLA trial with significantly higher ratings at 15, 30 and 75 min (all P < 0.05). Perceived exertion increased (F((3),(3)(8)) = 19.86, P < 0.01) throughout exercise and values, overall, were significantly lower (F((1),(1)(1)) = 9.26, P < 0.05) in the CAF trial compared to the PLA trial. Perceived arousal was elevated during exercise but did not differ between trials. Overall, the results suggest that a moderate dose of CAF ingested 1h prior to exercise maintains a more positive subjective experience during prolonged cycling. This observation may partially explain caffeine's ergogenic effects.
20437296<<>>Arousal<<>>Perceptual cues in nonverbal vocal expressions of emotion.<<>>Work on facial expressions of emotions (Calder, Burton, Miller, Young, & Akamatsu, [2001]) and emotionally inflected speech (Banse & Scherer, [1996]) has successfully delineated some of the physical properties that underlie emotion recognition. To identify the acoustic cues used in the perception of nonverbal emotional expressions like laugher and screams, an investigation was conducted into vocal expressions of emotion, using nonverbal vocal analogues of the "basic" emotions (anger, fear, disgust, sadness, and surprise; Ekman & Friesen, [1971]; Scott et al., [1997]), and of positive affective states (Ekman, [1992], [2003]; Sauter & Scott, [2007]). First, the emotional stimuli were categorized and rated to establish that listeners could identify and rate the sounds reliably and to provide confusion matrices. A principal components analysis of the rating data yielded two underlying dimensions, correlating with the perceived valence and arousal of the sounds. Second, acoustic properties of the amplitude, pitch, and spectral profile of the stimuli were measured. A discriminant analysis procedure established that these acoustic measures provided sufficient discrimination between expressions of emotional categories to permit accurate statistical classification. Multiple linear regressions with participants' subjective ratings of the acoustic stimuli showed that all classes of emotional ratings could be predicted by some combination of acoustic measures and that most emotion ratings were predicted by different constellations of acoustic features. The results demonstrate that, similarly to affective signals in facial expressions and emotionally inflected speech, the perceived emotional character of affective vocalizations can be predicted on the basis of their physical features.
7568642<<>>Arousal<<>>Assessment of female sexual arousal: response specificity and construct validity.<<>>Specificity of vaginal pulse amplitude and vaginal blood volume in reaction to visual sexual stimuli was investigated by comparing responses to sexual, anxiety-inducing, sexually threatening, and neutral film excerpts. Subjective sexual arousal, body sensations, emotional experience, skin conductance, and heart rate were monitored along with the genital measures. Self-report data confirmed the generation of affective states as intended. Results demonstrated response specificity of vaginal vasocongestion to sexual stimuli. In terms of both convergent and divergent validity, vaginal pulse amplitude was the superior genital measure. Skin conductance discriminated among stimuli only to a small degree, whereas heart rate failed to discriminate among stimuli altogether.
22266925<<>>Arousal<<>>Selective breeding for 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalization emission produces alterations in the ontogeny and regulation of rough-and-tumble play.<<>>Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are emitted by rodents and can signal either negative or positive affective states in social and nonsocial contexts. Our recent work has utilized selective breeding based upon the emission of 50 kHz USVs in response to standard cross species hand play-namely experimenters 'tickling' rats. Previous work has shown that high-tickle responsive animals (i.e., rats emitting abundant 50 kHz USVs) are gregarious and express enhanced positive emotional behaviors relative to animals exhibiting low 50 kHz USVs. The present study extends this work by examining the developmental profile of play behavior and the suppression of play behavior by predator (cat) odor in juvenile high-line and low-line animals. Results support dissociations in key play measures between these groups, with high-line animals emitting more dorsal contacts during play and low-line animals emitting more pinning behavior. For cat-odor induced play suppression, we found that high-line animals exhibit elevated suppression of play for a prolonged period compared to low-line rats. In contrast, low-line animals returned to normal levels of play just 1 day post-predator odor experience. These findings support the idea that emotional arousal may differ between these selectively bred groups, and extends previous work by demonstrating a possible influence of altered emotional learning and conditioning in these phenotypically different animals. One possibility is that high-line animals exhibit enhanced associative learning abilities leading to stronger negative contextual conditioning. These findings suggest that selection for positive or negative social-emotional phenotypes may also segregate genes that control emotional learning abilities in unanticipated ways.
21596060<<>>Arousal<<>>Human brain EEG indices of emotions: delineating responses to affective vocalizations by measuring frontal theta event-related synchronization.<<>>At present there is no direct brain measure of basic emotional dynamics from the human brain. EEG provides non-invasive approaches for monitoring brain electrical activity to emotional stimuli. Event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) analysis, based on power shifts in specific frequency bands, has some potential as a method for differentiating responses to basic emotions as measured during brief presentations of affective stimuli. Although there appears to be fairly consistent theta ERS in frontal regions of the brain during the earliest phases of processing affective auditory stimuli, the patterns do not readily distinguish between specific emotions. To date it has not been possible to consistently differentiate brain responses to emotion-specific affective states or stimuli, and some evidence to suggests the theta ERS more likely measures general arousal processes rather than yielding veridical indices of specific emotional states. Perhaps cortical EEG patterns will never be able to be used to distinguish discrete emotional states from the surface of the brain. The implications and limitations of such approaches for understanding human emotions are discussed.
3701577<<>>Arousal<<>>Electromyographic activity over facial muscle regions can differentiate the valence and intensity of affective reactions.<<>>Physiological measures have traditionally been viewed in social psychology as useful only in assessing general arousal and therefore as incapable of distinguishing between positive and negative affective states. This view is challenged in the present report. Sixteen subjects in a pilot study were exposed briefly to slides and tones that were mildly to moderately evocative of positive and negative affect. Facial electromyographic (EMG) activity differentiated both the valence and intensity of the affective reaction. Moreover, independent judges were unable to determine from viewing videotapes of the subjects' facial displays whether a positive or negative stimulus had been presented or whether a mildly or moderately intense stimulus had been presented. In the full experiment, 28 subjects briefly viewed slides of scenes that were mildly to moderately evocative of positive and negative affect. Again, EMG activity over the brow (corrugator supercilia), eye (orbicularis oculi), and cheek (zygomatic major) muscle regions differentiated the pleasantness and intensity of individuals' affective reactions to the visual stimuli even though visual inspection of the videotapes again indicated that expressions of emotion were not apparent. These results suggest that gradients of EMG activity over the muscles of facial expression can provide objective and continuous probes of affective processes that are too subtle or fleeting to evoke expressions observable under normal conditions of social interaction.
2818172<<>>Arousal<<>>Verbal coercive sexual behavior among college students.<<>>Coercive sexual behavior exists at alarming rates on college campuses. Researchers attempting to identify factors related to sexual coercion have primarily investigated either the coercing college male or the coerced college female, independent of relationship factors. The present study investigated the prevalence of verbal sexual coercion, the beliefs and attitudes of sexually coercive and noncoercive men, and the differences in affective states between groups and at different stages of relationship development. Undergraduate students were grouped on the basis of their self-reported sexual experience history as being sexually inexperienced, having had consensual sexual relationships only, or having had coercive sexual relationships. Also, subjects who reported having been sexually experienced were asked to rate the nature of their relationship to their sexual partner. Subjects completed measures referring to sexual attitudes, sexual arousal patterns, and the emotional components of a sexual encounter. Analyses indicated that 42% of the males in the sample had engaged in verbal sexual coercion. Differences on the measures were found between the sexual experience groups and the relationship type subgroups. Results are discussed in the context of the situational model, in which the coercive male plays an active role in shaping his environment.
2758296<<>>Arousal<<>>Periventricular structures and the organization of affective states and their behavioural expression.<<>>This paper reviews briefly a series of electrophysiological, neurochemical, and behavioural studies concerning the role by periventricular structures (periaqueductal gray and medial hypothalamus) in the generation of aversive affective states and in the organization of overt escape behaviours.
20350859<<>>Arousal<<>>Recognition of affect based on gait patterns.<<>>To provide a means for recognition of affect from a distance, this paper analyzes the capability of gait to reveal a person's affective state. We address interindividual versus person-dependent recognition, recognition based on discrete affective states versus recognition based on affective dimensions, and efficient feature extraction with respect to affect. Principal component analysis (PCA), kernel PCA, linear discriminant analysis, and general discriminant analysis are compared to either reduce temporal information in gait or extract relevant features for classification. Although expression of affect in gait is covered by the primary task of locomotion, person-dependent recognition of motion capture data reaches 95% accuracy based on the observation of a single stride. In particular, different levels of arousal and dominance are suitable for being recognized in gait. It is concluded that gait can be used as an additional modality for the recognition of affect. Application scenarios include monitoring in high-security areas, human-robot interaction, and cognitive home environments.
15808286<<>>Arousal<<>>Affect-modulated startle in adults with childhood-onset depression: relations to bipolar course and number of lifetime depressive episodes.<<>>To study affect regulation in adults with unipolar (n=38) and bipolar (n=38) forms of childhood-onset depression (COD), as compared with adults with no history of psychiatric illness (n=60), we examined affective modulation of the startle eyeblink reflex. Participants were subjected to binaural bursts of white noise while viewing pictures designed to elicit pleasant, neutral, or unpleasant affective states. The blink response was recorded from surface electrodes over the orbicularis oculi muscle during and following pictures. Participants rated the valence and arousal of their responses. Unlike control or bipolar groups, the unipolar group displayed a greater startle during the neutral condition than during the pleasant condition, and failed to display an increase in startle during the unpleasant condition. The bipolar group, unlike the unipolar and control groups, displayed a similar startle response after pleasant and unpleasant pictures. Participants with a high number of lifetime depressive episodes displayed a blunted startle response across affective conditions. Groups reported similar subjective responses to affective stimuli. Current affective symptoms and comorbid diagnoses did not influence startle modulation. In unipolar and bipolar forms of COD, unusual affective modulation or maintenance of the startle response, respectively, may reflect underlying deficits in affect regulation.
11117499<<>>Arousal<<>>The neural basis of romantic love.<<>>The neural correlates of many emotional states have been studied, most recently through the technique of fMRI. However, nothing is known about the neural substrates involved in evoking one of the most overwhelming of all affective states, that of romantic love, about which we report here. The activity in the brains of 17 subjects who were deeply in love was scanned using fMRI, while they viewed pictures of their partners, and compared with the activity produced by viewing pictures of three friends of similar age, sex and duration of friendship as their partners. The activity was restricted to foci in the medial insula and the anterior cingulate cortex and, subcortically, in the caudate nucleus and the putamen, all bilaterally. Deactivations were observed in the posterior cingulate gyrus and in the amygdala and were right-lateralized in the prefrontal, parietal and middle temporal cortices. The combination of these sites differs from those in previous studies of emotion, suggesting that a unique network of areas is responsible for evoking this affective state. This leads us to postulate that the principle of functional specialization in the cortex applies to affective states as well.
17425528<<>>Arousal<<>>Remembering can cause forgetting--but not in negative moods.<<>>Repeated retrieval of a subset of previously observed events can cause forgetting of the non-retrieved events. We examined how affective states experienced during retrieval modulate such retrieval-induced forgetting by inducing positive, negative, and neutral moods in subjects immediately before they attempted to retrieve studied items. On the basis of recent work, we hypothesized that positive moods encourage relational processing, which should increase interference from related events and thus enhance retrieval-induced forgetting. By contrast, negative moods should encourage item-specific processing, which should reduce interference and thus reduce such forgetting. Our results are consistent with these predictions. When subjects were in negative moods, repeated retrieval did not cause forgetting of the non-retrieved material, whereas when subjects were in positive and neutral moods, they showed reliable retrieval-induced forgetting. Our findings suggest that the emotions involved during interrogation of a witness can affect the result of repeated interrogations.
8933608<<>>Arousal<<>>Histories of childhood trauma and complex post-traumatic sequelae in women with eating disorders.<<>>The profound self-destructiveness and tenacity of eating disorders found among women abused and neglected in childhood become comprehensible when understood within a complex posttraumatic conceptualization as desperate attempts to regulate overwhelming affective states and construct a coherent sense of self and system of meaning. Trauma leads to the predictable consequences of dysregulation of the arousal system, avoidance, and constriction of affect; coherence of self and world are shattered. Abused patients' childhood experiences teach them that to need is to expose oneself to the pain of abandonment and betrayal at the hands of individuals responsible for their care. Consequently, needs-psychological, physical, and spiritual-come to be perceived as dangerous, and human relationships are simultaneously yearned for and feared. Robbed of the opportunity to develop a cohesive self and a coherent system of meaning and faith to sustain from within, the traumatized eating-disorder patient turns to the culture to tell her who to be and how to live; she learns that to conquer rather than satisfy needs and to be "in control" (an internal state of equanimity manifested externally in a thin body) will bring meaning and purpose. Binge eating, purging, and starving become apt metaphors for the boundless hunger, the wish to fulfill needs together with the wish to rid oneself forever of need, the desire to "purify" the damaged psychic and physical self, and the hope of restoring meaning. The treatment of the traumatized eating disorder patient is complex. Individual therapy provides the opportunity for intensive relational work that begins to restore faith in human connection and that provides a "safe base" from which to examine the trauma and separate past from present. Therapy groups for eating-disordered women and trauma survivors provide relief from isolation, valuable perspectives from others who have "been there," and the opportunity to contribute to others' healing as one heals. Ultimately, these patients must be willing to leave the world of obsession with food and weight, which guarantees safety from interpersonal hurt while it simultaneously guarantees that hope will not be restored. Though reconnecting with humanity carries the risk of further pain, it opens up the opportunity for connection, healing, and growth.
20431711<<>>Arousal<<>>Positive mood broadens visual attention to positive stimuli.<<>>In an attempt to investigate the impact of positive emotions on visual attention within the context of Fredrickson's (1998) broaden-and-build model, eye tracking was used in two studies to measure visual attentional preferences of college students (n=58, n=26) to emotional pictures. Half of each sample experienced induced positive mood immediately before viewing slides of three similarly-valenced images, in varying central-peripheral arrays. Attentional breadth was determined by measuring the percentage viewing time to peripheral images as well as by the number of visual saccades participants made per slide. Consistent with Fredrickson's theory, the first study showed that individuals induced into positive mood fixated more on peripheral stimuli than did control participants; however, this only held true for highly-valenced positive stimuli. Participants under induced positive mood also made more frequent saccades for slides of neutral and positive valence. A second study showed that these effects were not simply due to differences in emotional arousal between stimuli. Selective attentional broadening to positive stimuli may act both to facilitate later building of resources as well as to maintain current positive affective states.
11093070<<>>Arousal<<>>Periodic motor impairments in a case of 48-hour bipolar ultrarapid cycling before and under treatment with valproate.<<>>Motor impairments of psychiatric patients can be assessed with digital recordings of handwriting tasks. The investigation of patients with bipolar affective disorders differentiates intraindividual changes related to the patient's fluctuating affective states. An unmedicated 67-year-old male with 48-hour bipolar ultrarapid cycling was investigated during 8 consecutive days of ultrarapid cycling and 4 weeks later, after remission under treatment with valproate. The handwriting skills of the patient followed the same rhythmic changes of the psychopathology in the first part of the study and a steady pattern in the second phase, after remission. Therefore, it can be assumed that the handwriting skills reflect a state marker of the disease. Poorer handwriting skills on the manic days, as compared to the depressive ones, support the hypothesis of a low arousal in manic patients.
7887876<<>>Arousal<<>>Nonclinical hair-pulling: affective correlates and comparison with clinical samples.<<>>The purposes of the current study were to examine the affective states associated with hair-pulling in a nonclinical sample and to compare levels of general psychopathology in nonclinical hair-pullers and clinic patients with trichotillomania (TM) or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Subjects included 66 college undergraduates who engaged in hair-pulling unrelated to grooming, 18 patients with TM and 29 patients with OCD. Dimensional (but not categorical) ratings of affective experiences in the nonclinical sample indicated that hair-pulling was associated with decreases in tension, boredom, anger and sadness. Further, the relationship between emotional experiences before and after hair-pulling was more salient than the pre-during relationship conceptualized as central in current diagnostic criteria for TM. Comparisons of psychopathology in nonclinical and clinical samples failed to support a continuum notion of increasing symptomatology in nonclinical pullers, TM patients and individuals with OCD. Some evidence of increased pathology in nonclinical pullers relative to TM patients was obtained, as was further support for a distinction between TM and OCD. Implications of this investigation for conceptualization of TM are discussed.
3166599<<>>Arousal<<>>Cybernetics, activation, and drug effects.<<>>Patients present unique combinations of familial relationships, developmental idiosyncrasies, social aberrations, affective states, cognitive abilities, symptoms, defects, and maladaptations. Psychopharmacological treatments form a useful approach to cutting through this complexity to the core pathophysiology. Focusing on disorders that can be brought to complete remission by medication suggests that retarded and agitated depressions, manic and angry hyperactive paranoid states, panic disorder, emotionally unstable character disorders and schizophrenias are governed by the degree of derangement of an affective-activation control system. Defects in this control system are best conceptualized in cybernetic terms rather than in terms of the current rheostat models. Conceptualization of cybernetic defects allows for understanding of psychopathological developments as well as give a framework for pharmacological benefits. One aspect of the activation-affective disorders, are disorders of two types of pleasure regulatory mechanism, here referred to as appetitive and consummatory. The relationship of disorders of these hedonic control mechanisms to affective states and those of drug abuse are considered. This schema also affirms a close relationship between the bipolar affective disorders and the schizophrenias.
19014259<<>>Arousal<<>>Ultrasonic vocalizations of rats (Rattus norvegicus) during mating, play, and aggression: Behavioral concomitants, relationship to reward, and self-administration of playback.<<>>Rats (Rattus norvegicus) emit a variety of ultrasonic vocalizations throughout their lifespan that reflect different forms of emotional arousal and accompanying affective states. In this study, high frequency recordings of ultrasonic vocalizations were made during mating, aggression, and both conspecific and heterospecific (dubbed "tickling") rough-and-tumble play behavior. We found that frequency modulated 50-kHz calls (trills and step calls) were positively correlated with positively valenced appetitive behavior during mating, play, and aggression. These calls were also positively correlated with the reward value of these social encounters. However, constant frequency (i.e., flat) 50-kHz calls were not related to appetitive behaviors or reward. In contrast, 22-kHz calls were positively related to aversive/withdrawal behaviors during mating, play, and aggression. Finally, we found that rats self-administered playback of frequency modulated 50-kHz trill calls and avoided playback of 22-kHz calls. Playback of flat 50-kHz calls or tape hiss was neutral. These results suggest that frequency modulated 50-kHz calls index a positively valenced, appetitive, social-emotional state in rats.
23244772<<>>Arousal<<>>Biobehavioral reactivity to social evaluative stress in women with borderline personality disorder.<<>>Several clinical theories propose that borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by a biologically based affective vulnerability to intense affective experiences and impaired modulation of affective states, which might manifest in high emotional intensity, hyperreactivity, and impaired recovery to baseline. However, few studies have tested these theories based on emotional and biological responses of BPD participants in response to psychosocial stressors. This study examined cortisol, alpha-amylase, and subjective emotional reactivity to social evaluative stress among women with BPD compared with two healthy female control groups: a trait-matched (TM) group scoring similarly to the BPD group on trait measures of negative affect and impulsivity, and a non-trait-matched (NTM) group. Results generally suggested high emotional intensity and high baseline psychobiological arousal among individuals with BPD, but not emotional hyperreactivity or impaired recovery specific to the stressor. Relative to both control groups, BPD participants had higher baseline and overall subjective negative affect, higher baseline cortisol levels, and attenuated stress-related cortisol reactivity. In addition, both the BPD and TM groups had attenuated alpha-amylase reactivity in comparison to the NTM group. The differences between BPD and TM groups on most of the dependent measures suggest that emotional dysregulation in BPD is not merely an extreme variant of normative personality traits. These results suggest that women with BPD demonstrate intense and chronic negative affectivity along with high resting psychobiological arousal and attenuated psychobiological reactivity specific to laboratory stressors.
31073817<<>>Arousal<<>>Using Smartphone Survey Data and Machine Learning to Identify Situational and Contextual Risk Factors for HIV Risk Behavior Among Men Who Have Sex with Men Who Are Not on PrEP.<<>>"Just-in-time" interventions (JITs) delivered via smartphones have considerable potential for reducing HIV risk behavior by providing pivotal support at key times prior to sex. However, these programs depend on a thorough understanding of when risk behavior is likely to occur to inform the timing of JITs. It is also critical to understand the most important momentary risk factors that may precede HIV risk behavior, so that interventions can be designed to address them. Applying machine learning (ML) methods to ecological momentary assessment data on HIV risk behaviors can help answer both questions. Eighty HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM) who were not on PrEP completed a daily diary survey each morning and an experience sampling survey up to six times per day via a smartphone application for 30 days. Random forest models achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC) values for classifying high-risk condomless anal sex (CAS). These models achieved 80% specificity at a sensitivity value of 74%. Unsurprisingly, the most important contextual risk factors that aided in classification were participants' plans and intentions for sex, sexual arousal, and positive affective states. Findings suggest that survey data collected throughout the day can be used to correctly classify about three of every four high-risk CAS events, while incorrectly classifying one of every five non-CAS days as involving high-risk CAS. A unique set of risk factors also often emerge prior to high-risk CAS events that may be useful targets for JITs.
22396245<<>>Arousal<<>>The effect of exercise on affective and self-efficacy responses in older and younger women.<<>>BACKGROUND: This study examined the self-efficacy and affective responses to an acute exercise bout in sedentary older and younger women to determine whether aging has an effect on affective states. METHODS: Twenty-five sedentary younger (mean age = 19.9 yrs) and 25 older (mean age = 55.7 yrs) women completed an acute bout of exercise. Affective responses were measured before, during, and immediately following exercise. Self-efficacy responses were measured before and immediately following exercise. RESULTS: Positive engagement, revitalization, tranquility, Felt Arousal and Feeling Scale responses, and self-efficacy were all higher immediately following compared with before or during exercise for both groups of women. In addition, older women experienced higher overall positive engagement and lower physical exhaustion compared with younger women as well as higher tranquility and Feeling Scale responses immediately following exercise. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation found that an acute bout of moderate-intensity exercise produced more positive and fewer negative affective states in both younger and older women.
11826126<<>>Arousal<<>>Afferents to the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus.<<>>Sleep is influenced by diverse factors such as circadian time, affective states, ambient temperature, pain, etc., but pathways mediating these influences are unknown. To identify pathways that may influence sleep, we examined afferents to the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO), an area critically implicated in promoting sleep. Injections of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) into the VLPO produced modest numbers of CTB-labeled monoaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus, raphe nuclei, and ventrolateral medulla, as well as a few neurons in the locus coeruleus. Immunohistochemistry for monoaminergic markers showed dense innervation of the VLPO by histaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic fibers. Along with previous findings, these results suggest that the VLPO and monoaminergic nuclei may be reciprocally connected. Retrograde and anterograde tracing showed moderate or heavy inputs to the VLPO from hypothalamic regions including the median preoptic nucleus, lateral hypothalamic area, and dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH), autonomic regions including the infralimbic cortex and parabrachial nucleus, and limbic regions including the lateral septal nucleus and ventral subiculum. Light to moderate inputs arose from orexin and melanin concentrating hormone neurons, but cholinergic or dopaminergic inputs were extremely sparse. Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) projections to the VLPO were sparse, but the heavy input to the VLPO from the DMH, which receives direct and indirect SCN inputs, could provide an alternate pathway regulating the circadian timing of sleep. These robust pathways suggest candidate mechanisms by which sleep may be influenced by brain systems regulating arousal, autonomic, limbic, and circadian functions.
19879365<<>>Arousal<<>>Neural mechanisms of the influence of popularity on adolescent ratings of music.<<>>It is well-known that social influences affect consumption decisions. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to elucidate the neural mechanisms associated with social influence with regard to a common consumer good: music. Our study population was adolescents, age 12-17. Music is a common purchase in this age group, and it is widely believed that adolescent behavior is influenced by perceptions of popularity in their reference group. Using 15-s clips of songs from MySpace.com, we obtained behavioral measures of preferences and neurobiological responses to the songs. The data were gathered with, and without, the overall popularity of the song revealed. Song popularity had a significant effect on the participants' likability ratings of the songs. fMRI results showed a strong correlation between the participants' rating and activity in the caudate nucleus, a region previously implicated in reward-driven actions. The tendency to change one's evaluation of a song was positively correlated with activation in the anterior insula and anterior cingulate, two regions that are associated with physiological arousal and negative affective states. Sensitivity to popularity was linked to lower activation levels in the middle temporal gyrus, suggesting a lower depth of musical semantic processing. Our results suggest that a principal mechanism whereby popularity ratings affect consumer choice is through the anxiety generated by the mismatch between one's own preferences and others'. This mismatch anxiety motivates people to switch their choices in the direction of the consensus. Our data suggest that this is a major force behind the conformity observed in music tastes in some teenagers.
7843864<<>>Arousal<<>>Life events and stress reactivity as predictors of cancer, coronary heart disease and anxiety disorders.<<>>The topic relative to the differential psychobiological mechanisms between cancer and coronary illness has been showing for the last years. In this sense, some theoretical models which have been formulated by relevant authors have suggested the possibility of differentiating cancer and cardiovascular disease, both the onset and the progression, from coping strategies, personality variables and affective states, as well as the different categories of psychosocial stress. Likewise, the implication of psychological distress, such as anxiety, anger and depression for the occurrence of somatic disease has been reported frequently. This research was designed to analyze the psychosocial patterns which could explain the incidence of heart disease, cancer and anxiety based disorders. Measures of life events and stress reactivity were obtained from a total of 109 patients diagnosed as having breast cancer (37), infarct (37), and anxiety (35), and from 72 normal control subjects. Our data tend to show that the cancer group was strongly predicted by lost and illness events, while the coronary group was more associated with work events. The anxiety disorders group lacked a life events dimension, but shared the same category of the infarct group. We also found a strong relationship between depressive reactions and cancer in contrast to the anxiety-anger variable that was more relevant in the infarct patients. The interaction between internal and external stress factors in the etiology of disease is also discussed.
18494910<<>>Arousal<<>>Odor and color of cosmetic products: correlations between subjective judgement and autonomous nervous system response.<<>>The color and odor of cosmetics have been shown to be crucial for affective states and able to influence autonomic responses. We report an original procedure to measure the effect on subjects of the color and odor of cosmetic products, and to quantify the correlation between objective (psychophysiological recording) and subjective (psychophysics) responses. Several cosmetic products (lipsticks and nail varnishes) of different colors (white, brown, red, orange, and pink) and odors (two per product) were presented. In a first step, autonomous parameters (skin conductance (SC) and heart rate (HR)) were recorded, and in the second step, subjects rated their sensations on subjective scales (overall appreciation, pleasantness, and emotional arousal). Results indicated that certain color and odor additives in cosmetics act on relaxation, excitation, perceived pleasantness, and emotional arousal. It was also found that certain colors, perceived as pleasant, decreased HR, and that the perception of an 'arousing' perfume significantly increased SC.
16262989<<>>Arousal<<>>The circumplex model of affect: an integrative approach to affective neuroscience, cognitive development, and psychopathology.<<>>The circumplex model of affect proposes that all affective states arise from cognitive interpretations of core neural sensations that are the product of two independent neurophysiological systems. This model stands in contrast to theories of basic emotions, which posit that a discrete and independent neural system subserves every emotion. We propose that basic emotion theories no longer explain adequately the vast number of empirical observations from studies in affective neuroscience, and we suggest that a conceptual shift is needed in the empirical approaches taken to the study of emotion and affective psychopathologies. The circumplex model of affect is more consistent with many recent findings from behavioral, cognitive neuroscience, neuroimaging, and developmental studies of affect. Moreover, the model offers new theoretical and empirical approaches to studying the development of affective disorders as well as the genetic and cognitive underpinnings of affective processing within the central nervous system.
24065901<<>>Arousal<<>>The influence of emotions on cognitive control: feelings and beliefs-where do they meet?<<>>The influence of emotion on higher-order cognitive functions, such as attention allocation, planning, and decision-making, is a growing area of research with important clinical applications. In this review, we provide a computational framework to conceptualize emotional influences on inhibitory control, an important building block of executive functioning. We first summarize current neuro-cognitive models of inhibitory control and show how Bayesian ideal observer models can help reframe inhibitory control as a dynamic decision-making process. Finally, we propose a Bayesian framework to study emotional influences on inhibitory control, providing several hypotheses that may be useful to conceptualize inhibitory control biases in mental illness such as depression and anxiety. To do so, we consider the neurocognitive literature pertaining to how affective states can bias inhibitory control, with particular attention to how valence and arousal may independently impact inhibitory control by biasing probabilistic representations of information (i.e., beliefs) and valuation processes (e.g., speed-error tradeoffs).
11494959<<>>Arousal<<>>Investigating the effects of physical discomfort on laboratory-induced mood states.<<>>In order to investigate the effects of physical discomfort (i.e., pain) on the induction of mood, 139 participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: sad, sad with physical discomfort, happy, and happy with physical discomfort. Consistent with our hypotheses, the addition of physical discomfort resulted in a significantly stronger induction of self-reported depression, with these findings showing temporal specificity and persisting even after statistically controlling for stable response biases. However, other self-reported affective states, as well as cognitive and behavioral measures, were not significantly affected by physical discomfort. Findings are discussed with regard to making the laboratory induction of sad affect more consistent with the multifaceted experience of depression.
12821203<<>>Arousal<<>>Neuroendocrine responses to experimentally-induced emotions among abstinent opioid-dependent subjects.<<>>The present study investigated neuroendocrine and cardiovascular changes during experimentally-induced affective states in abstinent heroin-dependent subjects and healthy controls. The procedure for eliciting emotions in all subjects used pleasant and unpleasant stimuli that did not differ in subjective arousal properties. We investigated whether the valence of the stimuli differentially affected neuroendocrine responses by comparing neutral, pleasant and unpleasant pictures on heart rate (HR), systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), methyl-OH-phenyl-glycol (MHPG), norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (EPI), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol (CORT) plasma levels. Twelve abstinent heroin-dependent subjects, in comparison with 12 control subjects, were submitted to three experimental sessions, each on one of three experimental days a week apart, in counterbalanced order: day 1=unpleasant pictures, day 2=pleasant pictures, day 3=neutral pictures. In the rating of subjective arousal pleasant and unpleasant stimuli received the same high score in comparison with neutral stimuli; a different cardiovascular and neuroendocrine pattern was obtained in healthy subjects: unpleasant stimuli elicited increases in HR, SBP, MHPG, NE, ACTH, CORT, whereas neutral and pleasant stimuli did not induce any significant response in hormonal levels. In contrast, in heroin addicts, despite increased perceptions of unpleasantness, HR, SBP, MHPG and NE levels did not increase after disliked stimuli; these subjects also reported increased arousal during exposure to neutral stimuli. In comparison with controls, addicted individuals showed higher CORT and ACTH basal levels, and a consequent lack of response to unpleasant stimuli. The results indicate that neuroendocrine and cardiovascular systems respond selectively to affective, motivationally relevant stimuli, and that substance use disorders may be associated with dysregulation of emotion-processing mechanisms.
23142369<<>>Arousal<<>>Prefrontal cortex activity, sympatho-vagal reaction and behaviour distinguish between situations of feed reward and frustration in dwarf goats.<<>>Recent concepts relating to animal welfare accept that animals experience affective states. These are notoriously difficult to measure in non-verbal species, but it is generally agreed that emotional reactions consist of well-coordinated reactions in behaviour, autonomic and brain activation. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether each or a combination of these aspects can differentiate between situations presumed to differ in emotional content. To this end, we repeatedly confronted dwarf goats at short intervals with a covered and an uncovered feed bowl (i.e. presumably frustrating and rewarding situations respectively) whilst simultaneously observing their behaviour, measuring heart-rate and heart-rate variability and haemodynamic changes in the prefrontal cortex using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. When faced with a covered feed bowl, goats occupied themselves at locations away from the bowl and showed increased locomotion, while there was a general increase in prefrontal cortical activity. There was little indication of autonomic changes. In contrast, when feed was accessible, the goats reduced locomotion, focused their behaviour on the feed bowl, showed signs of sympathetically mediated arousal reflecting anticipation and, if any cortical activity at all was present, it was concentrated to the left hemisphere. We thus observed patterns in behaviour, sympathetic reaction and brain activity that distinguished between a situation of frustration and one of reward in dwarf goats. These patterns consisted of a well-coordinated set of reactions appropriate in respect of the emotional content of the stimuli used.
20371374<<>>Arousal<<>>Autonomic nervous system activity in emotion: a review.<<>>Autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity is viewed as a major component of the emotion response in many recent theories of emotion. Positions on the degree of specificity of ANS activation in emotion, however, greatly diverge, ranging from undifferentiated arousal, over acknowledgment of strong response idiosyncrasies, to highly specific predictions of autonomic response patterns for certain emotions. A review of 134 publications that report experimental investigations of emotional effects on peripheral physiological responding in healthy individuals suggests considerable ANS response specificity in emotion when considering subtypes of distinct emotions. The importance of sound terminology of investigated affective states as well as of choice of physiological measures in assessing ANS reactivity is discussed.
25174692<<>>Arousal<<>>[Coffee consumption in depressive disorders: it's not one size fits all].<<>>Caffeine is considered the world's most popular psychoactive substance. Its actions on the central nervous system, mainly mediated by antagonism of adenosine receptors and subsequent modulation of dopaminergic activity, would be particularly sought by depressed patients, as an attempt of self-medication. However, published data suggested that coffee consumption may worsen psychopathological conditions in mood disorders. Thus, we reviewed available evidence in the literature that investigated the effects of coffee consumption on clinical development of underlying psychopathology. Literature research was done by typing on Medline/PubMed and PsychINFO the key words "coffee AND major depression", "coffee AND dysthymia". The research was limited to English language publications and to studies conducted exclusively on humans. Although literature data are conflicting, extensive follow-up studies indicate a significant caffeine effect on risk reduction of developing clinical depression symptoms. Clinical worsening was observed mainly in cases of postpartum depression and comorbid panic disorder. Taking in account the study limitations, we observed a biphasic profile in caffeine psychostimulant effect: low to moderate doses may correlate with a reduction in depressive risk in healthy subjects and an improvement of many clinical symptoms (attention, arousal, psychomotor performance) in depressed patients, whereas the assumption of high doses may result in thymic dysregulation, favor mixed affective states and worsen circadian profiles and anxiety symptoms.
9522593<<>>Arousal<<>>[Psychology and psychobiology of childhood trauma].<<>>Exposure to overwhelming stress often determines how people subsequently organize their perceptions of themselves and of others. Traumatic experiences at different developmental levels have different effects on cognitive, affective and biological self-organization. Acute or chronic exposure to trauma may be expressed as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), dissociative disorders, somatic disturbances and alterations in perception of self and others. These disorders involve (a) the involuntary repetitive re-living of the trauma in thoughts, images, somatic states or behaviors, (b) attempts to avoid dealing with reminders of the past, (c) problems with the modulation of physiological responses to subsequent stress, and (d) a loss of capacity to engage in love and work with pleasure and satisfaction. The display of extremes of emotional distress, or of bizarre or disorganized behaviors, easily obscures the fact that current problems may have their origins in past trauma. The recognition that many psychiatric patients organize much of their lives around repetitive patterns of re-living and warding off traumatic memories, reminders and affective states, may help clinicians understand their symptoms as misguided attempts to regain a sense of control and safety, rather than as bizarre behaviors that need to be merely controlled. Since safe attachments appear to be the primary way in which children learn to regulate internal state changes, the negotiation of interpersonal safety needs to be the first focus of treatment. Since the labeling and categorization of emotional states is one of the principal areas of functioning that is disrupted by developmental trauma, treatment needs to include learning how to use words to understand and interpret feelings in general and stressful events, in particular. Since distrust and lack of social safety are critical parts of developmental trauma, structure and predictability are essential. Identifying specific trauma-based perceptions and expectations and learning how to negotiate the fulfillment of one's emotional needs are critical aspects of effective treatment.
22110588<<>>Arousal<<>>Disgust enhances the recollection of negative emotional images.<<>>Memory is typically better for emotional relative to neutral images, an effect generally considered to be mediated by arousal. However, this explanation cannot explain the full pattern of findings in the literature. Two experiments are reported that investigate the differential effects of categorical affective states upon emotional memory and the contributions of stimulus dimensions other than pleasantness and arousal to any memory advantage. In Experiment 1, disgusting images were better remembered than equally unpleasant frightening ones, despite the disgusting images being less arousing. In Experiment 2, regression analyses identified affective impact--a factor shown previously to influence the allocation of visual attention and amygdala response to negative emotional images--as the strongest predictor of remembering. These findings raise significant issues that the arousal account of emotional memory cannot readily address. The term impact refers to an undifferentiated emotional response to a stimulus, without requiring detailed consideration of specific dimensions of image content. We argue that ratings of impact relate to how the self is affected. The present data call for further consideration of the theoretical specifications of the mechanisms that lead to enhanced memory for emotional stimuli and their neural substrates.
16398603<<>>Arousal<<>>Local back massage with an automated massage chair: general muscle and psychophysiologic relaxing properties.<<>>OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present study was to test massage applied with an automated massage chair on the back muscles with regard to the effects on the tension of other muscles or on the neurovegetative tone, and to compare three different automated massage techniques. METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers participated in the study. The experiment consisted of an initial 5-minute period of relaxation without massage, and 5-minute periods of three different massage programs (roll-stretch massage, shiatsu massage, and beat massage). Subjects were randomized as to the presentation order. The following physiologic data were collected: frontalis and gastrocnemius electromyogram (EMG) activity, skin conductance, and peripheral skin temperature. Judgments of valence and arousal were registered using the pencil and- paper version of the five-point Self-Assessment Manikin. RESULTS: Roll-stretch and shiatsu massage were rated by participants as more pleasant than the relaxation period without massage or the beat massage. Whereas the four conditions were similar with regard to the mean frontal EMG values (reflecting primarily affective states), they differed regarding the gastrocnemius EMG (relating more to a general level of tension), roll-stretch massage, and shiatsu massage, resulting in less muscle tension than the control condition. Shiatsu massage was associated with significantly lower skin conductance than the control condition, whereas beat massage increased it significantly. A significant increase of skin temperature was found during the roll-stretch massage compared to the no-massage condition. CONCLUSIONS: Automated roll-stretch massage and shiatsu massage applied on the back can rapidly induce measurable relaxation in distant muscles not directly massaged, and is accompanied by signs of neurovegetative calming. Back massage applied by an automated massage chair may be an efficient and inexpensive general relaxation approach, and is especially interesting for patients who dislike to be touched.
2629011<<>>Arousal<<>>The autonomic differentiation of emotions revisited: convergent and discriminant validation.<<>>The convergent and discriminant validity of three models of physiological emotion specificity were compared. Forty-two female students served as subjects in a 2 (Context of emotional inductions: real-life, imagery) X 3 (Emotion: fear, anger, control) +1 (Happiness induced in real-life context) repeated measures design. The dependent measures included self-reports of emotion, Gottschalk-Gleser affect scores, back and forearm extensor EMG activity, body movements, heart period, respiration period, skin conductance, skin temperatures, pulse transit time, pulse volume amplitude, and blood volumes. Self-report data confirmed the generation of affective states in both contexts, as intended. Planned multivariate comparisons between physiological profiles established discriminant validity for fear and anger in the real-life context, whereas under imagery, emotion profiles were essentially equal. Convergent validity could not be substantiated. Implications for models of physiological specificity of emotion were discussed.
11098410<<>>Arousal<<>>Role of serotonergic and noradrenergic systems in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety disorders.<<>>There is abundant evidence for abnormalities of the norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5HT) neurotransmitter systems in depression and anxiety disorders. The majority of evidence supports underactivation of serotonergic function and complex dysregulation of noradrenergic function, most consistent with overactivation of this system. Treatment for these disorders requires perturbation of these systems. Reproducible increases in serotonergic function and decreases in noradrenergic function accompany treatment with antidepressants, and these alterations may be necessary for antidepressant efficacy. Dysregulation of these systems clearly mediates many symptoms of depression and anxiety. The underlying causes of these disorders, however, are less likely to be found within the NE and 5HT systems, per se. Rather their dysfunction is likely due to their role in modulating, and being modulated by, other neurobiologic systems that together mediate the symptoms of affective illness. Clarification of noradrenergic and serotonergic modulation of various brain regions may yield a greater understanding of specific symptomatology, as well as the underlying circuitry involved in euthymic and abnormal mood and anxiety states. Disrupted cortical regulation may mediate impaired concentration and memory, together with uncontrollable worry. Hypothalamic abnormalities likely contribute to altered appetite, libido, and autonomic symptoms. Thalamic and brainstem dysregulation contributes to altered sleep and arousal states. Finally, abnormal modulation of cortical-hippocampal-amygdala pathways may contribute to chronically hypersensitive stress and fear responses, possibly mediating features of anxiety, anhedonia, aggression, and affective dyscontrol. The continued appreciation of the neural circuitry mediating affective states and their modulation by neurotransmitter systems should further the understanding of the pathophysiology of affective and anxiety disorders.
2364752<<>>Arousal<<>>Hand, arm, and facial actions of young infants to a social and nonsocial stimulus.<<>>Do 9-15-week-old infants produce differentially organized hand and arm actions in relation to affective states when presented with social and nonsocial stimuli? This question was examined by observing 8 infants longitudinally. They were observed when facing their active and passive mother and an active and passive doll during 4 visits at biweekly intervals. Videotapes were coded in real time using the following measures: Vocalization, Gaze, and Gaze Avert; for face, Smiling, Distressed, and Neutral; for hands, Pointing, Open, Curled, and Closed; and for arms, Extended and At Side. Co-occurrence and lag sequential analyses showed that hand actions were organized with other infant actions to form unique behavioral linkages in each of the 4 conditions. The implications of these findings for the development of nonverbal communication are discussed.
11211069<<>>Arousal<<>>Pain and emotion: effects of affective picture modulation.<<>>OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: Two experiments examined the impact of viewing unpleasant, pleasant, and neutral photographic slides on cold-pain perception in healthy men and women. In each experiment, participants viewed one of three slide shows (experiment 1 = fear, disgust, or neutral; experiment 2 = erotic, nurturant, or neutral) immediately before a cold-pressor task. Skin conductance and heart rate were recorded during the slide shows, whereas visual analog scale ratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness thresholds and pain tolerance were recorded during the cold-pressor task. RESULTS: Viewing fear and disgust slides decreased pain intensity and unpleasantness thresholds, but only the fear slides decreased pain tolerance. In contrast, viewing erotic, but not nurturant, slides increased pain intensity and unpleasantness threshold ratings on the visual analog scale in men, whereas neither nurturant nor erotic slides altered pain tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with a motivational priming model that predicts that unpleasant affective states should enhance pain and that pleasant affective states should attenuate it.
31001176<<>>Arousal<<>>Language Origins Viewed in Spontaneous and Interactive Vocal Rates of Human and Bonobo Infants.<<>>From the first months of life, human infants produce "protophones," speech-like, non-cry sounds, presumed absent, or only minimally present in other apes. But there have been no direct quantitative comparisons to support this presumption. In addition, by 2 months, human infants show sustained face-to-face interaction using protophones, a pattern thought also absent or very limited in other apes, but again, without quantitative comparison. Such comparison should provide evidence relevant to determining foundations of language, since substantially flexible vocalization, the inclination to explore vocalization, and the ability to interact socially by means of vocalization are foundations for language. Here we quantitatively compare data on vocalization rates in three captive bonobo (Pan paniscus) mother-infant pairs with various sources of data from our laboratories on human infant vocalization. Both humans and bonobos produced distress sounds (cries/screams) and laughter. The bonobo infants also produced sounds that were neither screams nor laughs and that showed acoustic similarities to the human protophones. These protophone-like sounds confirm that bonobo infants share with humans the capacity to produce vocalizations that appear foundational for language. Still, there were dramatic differences between the species in both quantity and function of the protophone and protophone-like sounds. The bonobo protophone-like sounds were far less frequent than the human protophones, and the human protophones were far less likely to be interpreted as complaints and more likely as vocal play. Moreover, we found extensive vocal interaction between human infants and mothers, but no vocal interaction in the bonobo mother-infant pairs-while bonobo mothers were physically responsive to their infants, we observed no case of a bonobo mother vocalization directed to her infant. Our cross-species comparison focuses on low- and moderate-arousal circumstances because we reason the roots of language entail vocalization not triggered by excitement, for example, during fighting or intense play. Language appears to be founded in flexible vocalization, used to regulate comfortable social interaction, to share variable affective states at various levels of arousal, and to explore vocalization itself.
21862136<<>>Arousal<<>>Maternal posttraumatic stress symptoms and infant emotional reactivity and emotion regulation.<<>>The current study examined associations between maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and infant emotional reactivity and emotion regulation during the first year of life in a primarily low-income, urban, ethnic/racial minority sample of 52 mother-infant dyads. Mothers completed questionnaires assessing their own trauma exposure history and current PTSD and depressive symptoms and their infants' temperament when the infants were 6 months old. Dyads participated in the repeated Still-Face Paradigm (SFP-R) when the infants were 6 months old, and infant affective states were coded for each SFP-R episode. Mothers completed questionnaires assessing infant trauma exposure history and infant current emotional and behavioral symptoms when the infants were 13 months old. Maternal PTSD symptoms predicted infants' emotion regulation at 6 months as assessed by (a) infant ability to recover from distress during the SFP-R and (b) maternal report of infant rate of recovery from distress/arousal in daily life. Maternal PTSD symptoms also predicted maternal report of infant externalizing, internalizing, and dysregulation symptoms at 13 months. Maternal PTSD was not associated with measures of infant emotional reactivity. Neither maternal depressive symptoms nor infant direct exposure to trauma accounted for the associations between maternal PTSD symptoms and infant outcomes. These findings suggest that maternal PTSD is associated with offspring emotion regulation difficulties as early as infancy. Such difficulties may contribute to increased risk of mental health problems among children of mothers with PTSD.
10903405<<>>Arousal<<>>The imbalanced brain: from normal behavior to schizophrenia.<<>>An outstanding problem in psychiatry concerns how to link discoveries about the pharmacological, neurophysiological, and neuroanatomical substrates of mental disorders to the abnormal behaviors that they control. A related problem concerns how to understand abnormal behaviors on a continuum with normal behaviors. During the past few decades, neural models have been developed of how normal cognitive and emotional processes learn from the environment, focus attention and act upon motivationally important events, and cope with unexpected events. When arousal or volitional signals in these models are suitably altered, they give rise to symptoms that strikingly resemble negative and positive symptoms of schizophrenia, including flat affect, impoverishment of will, attentional problems, loss of a theory of mind, thought derailment, hallucinations, and delusions. This article models how emotional centers of the brain, such as the amygdala, interact with sensory and prefrontal cortices (notably ventral, or orbital, prefrontal cortex) to generate affective states, attend to motivationally salient sensory events, and elicit motivated behaviors. Closing this feedback loop between cognitive and emotional centers is predicted to generate a cognitive-emotional resonance that can support conscious awareness. When such emotional centers become depressed, negative symptoms of schizophrenia emerge in the model. Such emotional centers are modeled as opponent affective processes, such as fear and relief, whose response amplitude and sensitivity are calibrated by an arousal level and chemical transmitters that slowly inactivate, or habituate, in an activity-dependent way. These opponent processes exhibit an Inverted-U, whereby behavior becomes depressed if the arousal level is chosen too large or too small. The negative symptoms are owing to the way in which the depressed opponent process interacts with other circuits throughout the brain.
3344299<<>>Arousal<<>>Effects of menstrual phase and parental history of hypertension on cardiovascular response to cognitive challenge.<<>>The effects of parental history of hypertension and menstrual phase on systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) and heart rate (HR) responses to two frustrating cognitive tasks were examined in 47 normotensive, young adult women. Subjects with and without a parental history of hypertension were scheduled to be tested during either the follicular (days 7-11 of a 28-day cycle) or luteal (days 17-22) phase of the menstrual cycle. During the laboratory session, HR, SBP, DBP, and self-report of affective states were measured while subjects performed two cognitive tasks (mental arithmetic and concept formation). Results indicated that the magnitude of SBP responses to the two tasks was significantly greater in subjects tested during the follicular phase than in subjects tested in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. No effect of parental hypertension was observed on cardiovascular response measures, though offspring of hypertensive parents reported experiencing significantly less anger during the tasks than subjects with normotensive parents.
26746320<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>[Seasons, circadian rhythms, sleep and suicidal behaviors vulnerability].<<>>INTRODUCTION: Suicidal behaviors are common in the general population and are so a major public health problem. In order to improve suicide prevention and to reduce the mortality by suicide, it appears essential to better identify suicide risk factors. Seasonality, circadian rhythms and sleep abnormalities have been already associated with numerous psychiatric disorders. This review aimed to characterize the associations between seasonality, circadian rhythms, sleep and suicidal behaviors including suicide attempts and completed suicides. METHODS: We conducted a literature search between 1973 and 2015 in PubMed databases using the following terms: ("suicide" OR "suicidality" OR "suicide attempts" OR "suicidal behavior") AND ("circadian rhythms" OR "seasons" OR "sleep"). RESULTS: Many studies confirm a specific seasonality for suicide with a higher peak of suicides in spring for both sex and a lower peak in autumn especially for women. This distribution seems to correlate with depressive symptoms (especially for the autumn peak), gender and different types of suicide. Regarding gender and type of suicide differences, males more commonly commit violent suicide with a higher rate of suicides in spring. Suicide behaviors appear to be influenced by climatic and biological factors like sunshine, daylight cycles, temperature, air pollutants, viruses, parasites and aeroallergens. Circadian variations exist in suicide rates depending on age with a morning peak for elder and an evening peak for youth. In addition, completed suicide peak in early morning whereas suicide attempts peak rather in later afternoon. Several biomarkers dysregulation like melatonin, serotonin and cortisol may be implicated in suicide circadian variations. Furthermore, specific sleep disorders like insomnia, nightmares and sleep deprivation are common risk factors of suicide and possibly independently of the presence of depressive symptoms. Finally, the efficacy of chronotherapeutics (such as luminotherapy, dark therapy, sleep deprivation and melatonin drugs) has been suggested in the reduction of suicidal behaviors. CONCLUSION: The suicide seasonality is very well documented showing a main peak in spring and another one in autumn. A suicide circadian distribution also exists depending of the suicidal behavior intensity and of the age. Numerous sleep disorders are also suicide risk factors and can be treated with chronotherapeutics. A better identification of seasonality, circadian rhythms and sleep abnormalities in suicidal behaviors could allow a better prevention in suicidal attempts and a reduction in death by suicide.
27138767<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>The pathophysiology of monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis with special emphasis on the circadian rhythm of renal physiology.<<>>UNLABELLED: Nocturnal polyuria in monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MNE) has so far mainly been attributed to a disturbed circadian rhythm of renal water handling. Low vasopressin levels overnight correlate with absent maximal concentrating activity, resulting in an increased nocturnal diuresis with low urinary osmolality. Therefore, treatment with desmopressin is a rational choice. Unfortunately, 20 to 60 % of children with monosymptomatic enuresis are desmopressin-resistant. There is increasing evidence that other disturbed circadian rhythms might play a role in nocturnal polyuria. This review focuses on renal aspects in the pathophysiology of nocturnal polyuria in MNE, with special emphasis on circadian rhythms. Articles related to renal circadian rhythms and enuresis were searched through the PubMed library with the goal of providing a concise review. CONCLUSION: Nocturnal polyuria can only partially be explained by blunted circadian rhythm of vasopressin secretion. Other alterations in the intrinsic renal circadian clock system also seem to be involved, especially in desmopressin-resistant enuresis. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Disturbance in the circadian rhythm of arginine vasopressin secretion is related to nocturnal polyuria in children with enuresis. * Desmopressin is recommended as a treatment for monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis, working as a vasopressin analogue acting on V2 receptors in the collecting ducts of the kidney. What is New: * Other renal circadian rhythms might play a role in nocturnal polyuria, especially in desmopressin-resistant case.
28416676<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Dissociation of Per1 and Bmal1 circadian rhythms in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in parallel with behavioral outputs.<<>>The temporal order of physiology and behavior in mammals is primarily regulated by the circadian pacemaker located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Taking advantage of bioluminescence reporters, we monitored the circadian rhythms of the expression of clock genes Per1 and Bmal1 in the SCN of freely moving mice and found that the rate of phase shifts induced by a single light pulse was different in the two rhythms. The Per1-luc rhythm was phase-delayed instantaneously by the light presented at the subjective evening in parallel with the activity onset of behavioral rhythm, whereas the Bmal1-ELuc rhythm was phase-delayed gradually, similar to the activity offset. The dissociation was confirmed in cultured SCN slices of mice carrying both Per1-luc and Bmal1-ELuc reporters. The two rhythms in a single SCN slice showed significantly different periods in a long-term (3 wk) culture and were internally desynchronized. Regional specificity in the SCN was not detected for the period of Per1-luc and Bmal1-ELuc rhythms. Furthermore, neither is synchronized with circadian intracellular Ca(2+) rhythms monitored by a calcium indicator, GCaMP6s, or with firing rhythms monitored on a multielectrode array dish, although the coupling between the circadian firing and Ca(2+) rhythms persisted during culture. These findings indicate that the expressions of two key clock genes, Per1 and Bmal1, in the SCN are regulated in such a way that they may adopt different phases and free-running periods relative to each other and are respectively associated with the expression of activity onset and offset.
27784643<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Possible molecular mechanism underlying cadmium-induced circadian rhythms disruption in zebrafish.<<>>This study was aimed to explore the mechanisms underlying cadmium-induced circadian rhythms disruption. Two groups of zebrafish larvae treated with or without 5 ppm CdCl2 were incubated in a photoperiod of 14-h light/10-h dark conditions. The mRNA levels of clock1a, bmal1b, per2 and per1b in two groups were determined. Microarray data were generated in two group of samples. Differential expression of genes were identified and the changes in expression level for some genes were validated by RT-PCR. Finally, Gene Ontology functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were performed. In comparison with normal group, the mRNA levels of clock1a, bmal1b, and per2 were significantly changed and varied over the circadian cycle in CdCl2-treated group. DEGs were obtained from the light (84 h, ZT12) and dark (88 h, ZT16) phase. In addition, G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway and immune response were both enriched by DEGs in both groups. While, proteolysis and amino acid metabolism were found associated with DEGs in light phase, and Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and oxidation-reduction process were significantly enriched by DEGs in dark phase. Besides, the expression pattern of genes including hsp70l and or115-11 obtained by RT-PCR were consistent with those obtained by microarray analysis. As a consequence, cadmium could make significant effects on circadian rhythms through immune response and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. Besides, between the dark and the light phase, the mechanism by which cadmium inducing disruption of circadian rhythms were different to some extent.
28759269<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Disrupted circadian rhythms of body temperature, heart rate and fasting blood glucose in prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus.<<>>We report a progressive disruption of 24-h rhythms in fasting blood glucose (FBG), body temperature (BT) and heart rate (HR) associated with metabolic dysfunction and the development of prediabetes (PD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in overweight middle-aged (40-69 years old) humans. Increasing BT and HR mean values and declining 24-h BT and HR amplitudes accompany adverse changes in metabolic state. Increased nocturnal BT and a phase delay of the 24-h BT rhythm, deviant 24-h HR profile and a phase advance of the 24-h HR and FBG rhythms are early signs of the PD metabolic state. In T2DM, the 24-h FBG rhythm is no longer detectable, and the 24-h amplitudes of BT and HR are greatly diminished. In addition, lepton and creatinine values were lowered in T2DM. Moreover, positive correlations between FBG and body mass index, BMI, and negative correlations between the 24-h amplitude of FBG and BMI indicate that overweight is an additional factor causing disruption of the circadian rhythms. Further studies on circadian disruption as a consequence of metabolic dysfunction are necessary. The quantitative analysis of changing circadian BT and HR rhythms may provide prognostic markers of T2DM and therapeutic targets for its prevention and correction.
28625682<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Are circadian rhythms new pathways to understand Autism Spectrum Disorder?<<>>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a frequent neurodevelopmental disorder. ASD is probably the result of intricate interactions between genes and environment altering progressively the development of brain structures and functions. Circadian rhythms are a complex intrinsic timing system composed of almost as many clocks as there are body cells. They regulate a variety of physiological and behavioral processes such as the sleep-wake rhythm. ASD is often associated with sleep disorders and low levels of melatonin. This first point raises the hypothesis that circadian rhythms could have an implication in ASD etiology. Moreover, circadian rhythms are generated by auto-regulatory genetic feedback loops, driven by transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1, who drive transcription daily patterns of a wide number of clock-controlled genes (CCGs) in different cellular contexts across tissues. Among these, are some CCGs coding for synapses molecules associated to ASD susceptibility. Furthermore, evidence emerges about circadian rhythms control of time brain development processes.
25214491<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian rhythms affect electroretinogram, compound eye color, striking behavior and locomotion of the praying mantis Hierodula patellifera.<<>>Many behaviors and physiological processes oscillate with circadian rhythms that are synchronized to environmental cues (e.g. light onset), but persist with periods of ~24 h in the absence of such cues. We used a multilevel experimental approach to assess whether circadian rhythms modulate several aspects of the visual physiology and behavior of the praying mantis Hierodula patellifera. We used electroretinograms (ERGs) to assess compound eye sensitivity, colorimetric photographic analyses to assess compound eye color changes (screening pigment migration), behavioral assays of responsiveness to computer-generated prey-like visual stimuli and analyses of locomotor activity patterns on a modified treadmill apparatus. Our results indicate that circadian clocks control and/or modulate each of the target behaviors. Strong rhythms, persisting under constant conditions, with periods of ~24 h were evident in photoreceptor sensitivity to light, appetitive responsiveness to prey-like stimuli and gross locomotor activity. In the first two cases, responsiveness was highest during the subjective night and lowest during the subjective day. Locomotor activity was strongly clustered around the transition time from day to night. In addition, pigment migration and locomotor behavior responded strongly to light:dark cycles and anticipated the light-dark transition, suggesting that the circadian clocks modulating both were entrained to environmental light cues. Together, these data indicate that circadian rhythms operate at the cellular, cellular systems and organismal level in H. patellifera. Our results represent an intriguing first step in uncovering the complexities of circadian rhythms in the Mantodea.
28465284<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Development of diabetes does not alter behavioral and molecular circadian rhythms in a transgenic rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus.<<>>Metabolic state and circadian clock function exhibit a complex bidirectional relationship. Circadian disruption increases propensity for metabolic dysfunction, whereas common metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are associated with impaired circadian rhythms. Specifically, alterations in glucose availability and glucose metabolism have been shown to modulate clock gene expression and function in vitro; however, to date, it is unknown whether development of diabetes imparts deleterious effects on the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) circadian clock and SCN-driven outputs in vivo. To address this question, we undertook studies in aged diabetic rats transgenic for human islet amyloid polypeptide, an established nonobese model of T2DM (HIP rat), which develops metabolic defects closely recapitulating those present in patients with T2DM. HIP rats were also cross-bred with a clock gene reporter rat model (Per1:luciferase transgenic rat) to permit assessment of the SCN and the peripheral molecular clock function ex vivo. Utilizing these animal models, we examined effects of diabetes on 1) behavioral circadian rhythms, 2) photic entrainment of circadian activity, 3) SCN and peripheral tissue molecular clock function, and 4) melatonin secretion. We report that circadian activity, light-induced entrainment, molecular clockwork, as well as melatonin secretion are preserved in the HIP rat model of T2DM. These results suggest that despite the well-characterized ability of glucose to modulate circadian clock gene expression acutely in vitro, SCN clock function and key behavioral and physiological outputs appear to be preserved under chronic diabetic conditions characteristic of nonobese T2DM.
27849618<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian rhythms identified in Caenorhabditis elegans by in vivo long-term monitoring of a bioluminescent reporter.<<>>Circadian rhythms are based on endogenous clocks that allow organisms to adjust their physiology and behavior by entrainment to the solar day and, in turn, to select the optimal times for most biological variables. Diverse model systems-including mice, flies, fungi, plants, and bacteria-have provided important insights into the mechanisms of circadian rhythmicity. However, the general principles that govern the circadian clock of Caenorhabditis elegans have remained largely elusive. Here we report robust molecular circadian rhythms in C elegans recorded with a bioluminescence assay in vivo and demonstrate the main features of the circadian system of the nematode. By constructing a luciferase-based reporter coupled to the promoter of the suppressor of activated let-60 Ras (sur-5) gene, we show in both population and single-nematode assays that C elegans expresses approximately 24-h rhythms that can be entrained by light/dark and temperature cycles. We provide evidence that these rhythms are temperature-compensated and can be re-entrained after phase changes of the synchronizing agents. In addition, we demonstrate that light and temperature sensing requires the photoreceptors LITE and GUR-3, and the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel subunit TAX-2. Our results shed light on C elegans circadian biology and demonstrate evolutionarily conserved features in the circadian system of the nematode.
27726448<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian rhythms in bed rest: Monitoring core body temperature via heat-flux approach is superior to skin surface temperature.<<>>Continuous recordings of core body temperature (CBT) are a well-established approach in describing circadian rhythms. Given the discomfort of invasive CBT measurement techniques, the use of skin temperature recordings has been proposed as a surrogate. More recently, we proposed a heat-flux approach (the so-called Double Sensor) for monitoring CBT. Studies investigating the reliability of the heat-flux approach over a 24-hour period, as well as comparisons with skin temperature recordings, are however lacking. The first aim of the study was therefore to compare rectal, skin, and heat-flux temperature recordings for monitoring circadian rhythm. In addition, to assess the optimal placement of sensor probes, we also investigated the effect of different anatomical measurement sites, i.e. sensor probes positioned at the forehead vs. the sternum. Data were collected as part of the Berlin BedRest study (BBR2-2) under controlled, standardized, and thermoneutral conditions. 24-hours temperature data of seven healthy males were collected after 50 days of -6 degrees head-down tilt bed-rest. Mean Pearson correlation coefficients indicated a high association between rectal and forehead temperature recordings (r > 0.80 for skin and Double Sensor). In contrast, only a poor to moderate relationship was observed for sensors positioned at the sternum (r = -0.02 and r = 0.52 for skin and Double Sensor, respectively). Cross-correlation analyses further confirmed the feasibility of the forehead as a preferred monitoring site. The phase difference between forehead Double Sensor and rectal recordings was not statistically different from zero (p = 0.313), and was significantly smaller than the phase difference between forehead skin and rectal temperatures (p = 0.016). These findings were substantiated by cosinor analyses, revealing significant differences for mesor, amplitude, and acrophase between rectal and forehead skin temperature recordings, but not between forehead Double Sensor and rectal temperature measurements. Finally, Bland-Altman analysis indicated narrower limits of agreement for rhythm parameters between rectal and Double Sensor measurements compared to between rectal and skin recordings, irrespective of the measurement site (i.e. forehead, sternum). Based on these data we conclude that (1) Double Sensor recordings are significantly superior to skin temperature measurements for non-invasively assessing the circadian rhythm of rectal temperature, and (2) temperature rhythms from the sternum are less reliable than from the forehead. We suggest that forehead Double Sensor recordings may provide a surrogate for rectal temperature in circadian rhythm research, where constant routine protocols are applied. Future studies will be needed to assess the sensor's ecological validity outside the laboratory under changing environmental and physiological conditions.
28711776<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Sleep-wake profiles and circadian rhythms of core temperature and melatonin in young people with affective disorders.<<>>While disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle are common in people with affective disorders, the characteristics of these disturbances differ greatly between individuals. This heterogeneity is likely to reflect multiple underlying pathophysiologies, with different perturbations in circadian systems contributing to the variation in sleep-wake cycle disturbances. Such disturbances may be particularly relevant in adolescents and young adults with affective disorders as circadian rhythms undergo considerable change during this key developmental period. This study aimed to identify profiles of sleep-wake disturbance in young people with affective disorders and investigate associations with biological circadian rhythms. Fifty young people with affective disorders and 19 control participants (aged 16-31 years) underwent actigraphy monitoring for approximately two weeks to derive sleep-wake cycle parameters, and completed an in-laboratory assessment including evening dim-light saliva collection for melatonin assay and overnight continuous core body temperature measurement. Cluster analysis based on sleep-wake cycle parameters identified three distinct patient groups, characterised by 'delayed sleep-wake', 'disrupted sleep', and 'long sleep' respectively. The 'delayed sleep-wake' group had both delayed melatonin onset and core temperature nadir; whereas the other two cluster groups did not differ from controls on these circadian markers. The three groups did not differ on clinical characteristics. These results provide evidence that only some types of sleep-wake disturbance in young people with affective disorders are associated with fundamental circadian perturbations. Consequently, interventions targeting endogenous circadian rhythms to promote a phase shift may be particularly relevant in youth with affective disorders presenting with delayed sleep-wake cycles.
29926582<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>[Effects of chronic stress depression on the circadian rhythm of peripheral neuroendocrine hormone of rats].<<>>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the circadian rhythmic alterations of plasma hormone and peptide induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress(CUMS). METHODS: Sixty male SD rats were randomly divided into two groups, model group and control group(n=30). Rats in model group received CUMS procedure (restraint, rotation, cage tilt, wet sawdust, cold, crowding, food or water deprivation, clamp tail and reverse light/dark cycle). Rats were randomly exposed to two stressors every day for 3 weeks. Exploratory locomotor activity was assessed by open field test and anxiety-like behavior was measured by elevated plus-maze test, and lack of pleasure by sucrose preference test. Blood samples were collected at each of six time points zeitgeber time (ZT1, 5, 9, 13, 17 and 21), 5 rats were executed at each time point. Plasma concentrations of corticosterone(CORT), melatonin (MT) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) were detected by ELISA kits, and plasma concentration of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was determined by radioimmunoassay. The circadian rhythm changes of serum CORT, MT, VIP and ACTH in each group were compared by using cosinor. RESULTS: Compared with control group, locomotor activity, rearing, weight gain and sucrose consumption in model group were decreased significantly. The values of the percentage of open-arm time (OT) and open arm entries (OE) were obviously lower in the model group than those in the control group. The circadian rhythm of plasma ACTH and CORT showed an obvious disorder, including phase advance and decrease in amplitude, and markedly blunted circadian rhythm. There also showed a markedly blunted circadian rhythm and decreased levels of plasma MT. VIP still had 24-hour rhythm, but the amplitude was significantly lower, peak phase also delayed for six hours, and expression was significantly higher. CONCLUSIONS: CUMS induces these peptides and hormones desynchronized from suprachiasmatic nucleus(SCN), manifested as the disturbed circadian rhythms and the abnormal hormone secretion of these synchronizers.
26686899<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Effect of age, gender and exercise on salivary dehydroepiandrosterone circadian rhythm profile in human volunteers.<<>>There has been a lot of effort by scientists to elucidate the multi functions of the naturally occurring hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). However, to plan research experiments optimally, it is important first to characterize the diurnal rhythm in healthy individuals. The aim of this research was to investigate the daily circadian rhythms of DHEA among the 2 genders, and the effect of age and exercise on salivary DHEA circadian rhythms. Volunteers (20-39 and 40-60 years) were recruited for 2 studies investigating the salivary DHEA circadian rhythm. The first study looked at the effect of gender and age on DHEA levels on 2 non-consecutive days, and the second study explored the effect of exercise on DHEA circadian rhythm in males. DHEA levels were estimated by a sensitive and specific ELISA method. The results showed a clear daily circadian rhythm in salivary DHEA in all participants groups, however the profile was flatter in the older female group. There was a significant difference between age and gender groups particularly at 8.00 h. In young males DHEA reduced from 541.1 +/- 101.3 (mean +/- sd) at 8.00 h to 198.9 +/- 90.7 pg/mL at 18.00 h; p<0.0001, and young females from 401.6 +/- 149.5 to 215.4 +/- 95.3 pg/mL; p<0.001. In older males DHEA reduced from 267.5 +/- 32.4 to 132.5 +/- 46.7 pg/mL; p<0.001, and older females from 147.7 +/- 78.1 to 89.5 +/- 29.1 pg/mL; p=0.05. DHEA levels on 2 non-consecutive days showed some variations but this was not significant. Aerobic exercise has significantly increased DHEA levels at 2 time points of the day (p=0.05) in male subjects. In conclusion, our study showed a clear daily circadian rhythm in salivary DHEA in all participants was observed, but the profile was flatter in the older groups.
26188089<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>FTO modulates circadian rhythms and inhibits the CLOCK-BMAL1-induced transcription.<<>>Variations in the human fat mass and obesity-associated gene, which encodes FTO, an 2-oxoglutarate-dependent nucleic acid demethylase, are associated with increased risk of obesity. These FTO variations were recently shown to affect IRX3 and the exact function of FTO is still controversial. Obesity is closely linked to circadian rhythm. To understand the role of FTO in circadian rhythm, we analyzed the circadian rhythm of FTO deficient mice. FTO deficient mice had robust circadian locomotor activity rhythms with prolonged periods. The light-induced phase shifts of circadian rhythms were also significantly affected in FTO deficient mice. Tissue explants of FTO deficient mice maintained robust peripheral rhythms with prolonged period. Overexpress of FTO represses the transcriptional activation by CLOCK and BMAL1. Core clock genes expression of mRNA and protein were also altered in FTO deficient mice. Furthermore, FTO co-immunoprecipitated with CRY1/2 in a circadian manner. These results indicate a fundamental link between the circadian rhythm and FTO and extend the function of FTO to the core clockwork machinery.
28326910<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian Rhythms in Plasma Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor Differ in Men and Women.<<>>The measurement of circulating levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been proposed to be a marker of disease and an indicator of recovery. Thus, knowing the temporal pattern and influence of potential circadian rhythms is important. Although several studies have measured BDNF at different times of day, no studies have done so while controlling for potential masking influences such as sleep and activity. Further, no previous study has examined circadian rhythms within individuals. We examined circadian rhythms in plasma BDNF while minimizing masking from behavioral and environmental factors using a 30-h constant routine (CR) protocol. In a sample of 39 healthy adults, we found significant circadian rhythms in 75% of women and 52% of men. The timing of the acrophase of the BDNF rhythm, however, was unrelated to clock time in women, while it was related to clock time in men. These results indicate that the use of single-sample measures of plasma BDNF as a marker of disease will be unreliable, especially in women. Repeated plasma BDNF samples over a 24-h period within individuals would be needed to reveal abnormalities related to disease states.
29508358<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>The role of melatonin and cortisol circadian rhythms in the pathogenesis of infantile colic.<<>>BACKGROUND: Despite the high prevalence of infantile colic, the pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Cortisol and melatonin hormones affect gastrointestinal system development in several ways, and interestingly, both cortisol and melatonin's circadian rhythms begin around the 3rd month in which infantile colic symptoms start to decrease. We hypothesized that infantile colic might associate with desynchronization of normal circadian rhythms of these hormones. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of melatonin and cortisol in the pathogenesis of infantile colic. METHODS: Patients who were diagnosed as infantile colic according to Wessel's "rule of three" were enrolled in the colic group. We measured the saliva melatonin and cortisol levels of colic group and control group infants. In both groups, the saliva samples were taken in mornings and at evenings, at the time of diagnosis and 6th month. RESULTS: Fifty-five infants finished the study. Melatonin circadian rhythm developed earlier in the control group than the infantile colic group in our study. We found no significant difference between the daily mean cortisol levels. However, infants with colic had flatter daily cortisol slope than controls which pointed out the probability that they had a less clearly defined cortisol rhythm than infants without colic. CONCLUSIONS: We found an association between melatonin levels and infantile colic. However, more research is needed to fully understand the role of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and hormone's role on infantile colic physiopathology.
24997189<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Robust circadian rhythms in organoid cultures from PERIOD2::LUCIFERASE mouse small intestine.<<>>Disruption of circadian rhythms is a risk factor for several human gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, ranging from diarrhea to ulcers to cancer. Four-dimensional tissue culture models that faithfully mimic the circadian clock of the GI epithelium would provide an invaluable tool to understand circadian regulation of GI health and disease. We hypothesized that rhythmicity of a key circadian component, PERIOD2 (PER2), would diminish along a continuum from ex vivo intestinal organoids (epithelial 'miniguts'), nontransformed mouse small intestinal epithelial (MSIE) cells and transformed human colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells. Here, we show that bioluminescent jejunal explants from PERIOD2::LUCIFERASE (PER2::LUC) mice displayed robust circadian rhythms for >72 hours post-excision. Circadian rhythms in primary or passaged PER2::LUC jejunal organoids were similarly robust; they also synchronized upon serum shock and persisted beyond 2 weeks in culture. Remarkably, unshocked organoids autonomously synchronized rhythms within 12 hours of recording. The onset of this autonomous synchronization was slowed by >2 hours in the presence of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 (20 muM). Doubling standard concentrations of the organoid growth factors EGF, Noggin and R-spondin enhanced PER2 oscillations, whereas subtraction of these factors individually at 24 hours following serum shock produced no detectable effects on PER2 oscillations. Growth factor pulses induced modest phase delays in unshocked, but not serum-shocked, organoids. Circadian oscillations of PER2::LUC bioluminescence aligned with Per2 mRNA expression upon analysis using quantitative PCR. Concordant findings of robust circadian rhythms in bioluminescent jejunal explants and organoids provide further evidence for a peripheral clock that is intrinsic to the intestinal epithelium. The rhythmic and organotypic features of organoids should offer unprecedented advantages as a resource for elucidating the role of circadian rhythms in GI stem cell dynamics, epithelial homeostasis and disease.
27476975<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian Rhythm Disruption Promotes Lung Tumorigenesis.<<>>Circadian rhythms are 24-hr oscillations that control a variety of biological processes in living systems, including two hallmarks of cancer, cell division and metabolism. Circadian rhythm disruption by shift work is associated with greater risk for cancer development and poor prognosis, suggesting a putative tumor-suppressive role for circadian rhythm homeostasis. Using a genetically engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma, we have characterized the effects of circadian rhythm disruption on lung tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that both physiologic perturbation (jet lag) and genetic mutation of the central circadian clock components decreased survival and promoted lung tumor growth and progression. The core circadian genes Per2 and Bmal1 were shown to have cell-autonomous tumor-suppressive roles in transformation and lung tumor progression. Loss of the central clock components led to increased c-Myc expression, enhanced proliferation, and metabolic dysregulation. Our findings demonstrate that both systemic and somatic disruption of circadian rhythms contribute to cancer progression.
26584570<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Osteoarthritis-like pathologic changes in the knee joint induced by environmental disruption of circadian rhythms is potentiated by a high-fat diet.<<>>A variety of environmental factors contribute to progressive development of osteoarthritis (OA). Environmental factors that upset circadian rhythms have been linked to various diseases. Our recent work establishes chronic environmental circadian disruption - analogous to rotating shiftwork-associated disruption of circadian rhythms in humans - as a novel risk factor for the development of OA. Evidence suggests shift workers are prone to obesity and also show altered eating habits (i.e., increased preference for high-fat containing food). In the present study, we investigated the impact of chronic circadian rhythm disruption in combination with a high-fat diet (HFD) on progression of OA in a mouse model. Our study demonstrates that when mice with chronically circadian rhythms were fed a HFD, there was a significant proteoglycan (PG) loss and fibrillation in knee joint as well as increased activation of the expression of the catabolic mediators involved in cartilage homeostasis. Our results, for the first time, provide the evidence that environmental disruption of circadian rhythms plus HFD potentiate OA-like pathological changes in the mouse joints. Thus, our findings may open new perspectives on the interactions of chronic circadian rhythms disruption with diet in the development of OA and may have potential clinical implications.
25499101<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian rhythms, alcohol and gut interactions.<<>>The circadian clock establishes rhythms throughout the body with an approximately 24 hour period that affect expression of hundreds of genes. Epidemiological data reveal chronic circadian misalignment, common in our society, significantly increases the risk for a myriad of diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, infertility and gastrointestinal disease. Disruption of intestinal barrier function, also known as gut leakiness, is especially important in alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Several studies have shown that alcohol causes ALD in only a 20-30% subset of alcoholics. Thus, a better understanding is needed of why only a subset of alcoholics develops ALD. Compelling evidence shows that increased gut leakiness to microbial products and especially LPS play a critical role in the pathogenesis of ALD. Clock and other circadian clock genes have been shown to regulate lipid transport, motility and other gut functions. We hypothesized that one possible mechanism for alcohol-induced intestinal hyperpermeability is through disruption of central or peripheral (intestinal) circadian regulation. In support of this hypothesis, our recent data shows that disruption of circadian rhythms makes the gut more susceptible to injury. Our in vitro data show that alcohol stimulates increased Clock and Per2 circadian clock proteins and that siRNA knockdown of these proteins prevents alcohol-induced permeability. We also show that intestinal Cyp2e1-mediated oxidative stress is required for alcohol-induced upregulation of Clock and Per2 and intestinal hyperpermeability. Our mouse model of chronic alcohol feeding shows that circadian disruption through genetics (in Clock(triangle up19) mice) or environmental disruption by weekly 12h phase shifting results in gut leakiness alone and exacerbates alcohol-induced gut leakiness and liver pathology. Our data in human alcoholics show they exhibit abnormal melatonin profiles characteristic of circadian disruption. Taken together our data support circadian mechanisms for alcohol-induced gut leakiness that could provide new therapeutic targets for ALD.
30888851<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Preservation of circadian rhythms by the protein folding chaperone, BiP.<<>>Dysregulation of collagen synthesis is associated with disease progression in cancer and fibrosis. Collagen synthesis is coordinated with the circadian clock, which in cancer cells is, curiously, deregulated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We hypothesized interplay between circadian rhythm, collagen synthesis, and ER stress in normal cells. Here we show that fibroblasts with ER stress lack circadian rhythms in gene expression upon clock-synchronizing time cues. Overexpression of binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) or treatment with chemical chaperones strengthens the oscillation amplitude of circadian rhythms. The significance of these findings was explored in tendon, where we showed that BiP expression is ramped preemptively prior to a surge in collagen synthesis at night, thereby preventing protein misfolding and ER stress. In turn, this forestalls activation of the unfolded protein response in order for circadian rhythms to be maintained. Thus, targeting ER stress could be used to modulate circadian rhythm and restore collagen homeostasis in disease.-Pickard, A., Chang, J., Alachkar, N., Calverley, B., Garva, R., Arvan, P., Meng, Q.-J., Kadler, K.

30395149<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Effect of chronic corticosterone-induced depression on circadian rhythms and age-related phenotypes in mice.<<>>Disrupted circadian rhythms are a recognized effect of depression, and our previous article demonstrated an association between depression and premature aging, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In the present study, we used a mouse model of chronic corticosterone (CORT)-treated depression to elucidate a mechanism by which depression may be associated with the circadian clock and mediate age-related phenotypes. Mice received a daily injection of 20 mg/kg CORT for 21 consecutive days, and the depression-like behaviors of mice were identified by the sucrose intake test, tail suspension test and open field test. Our findings indicated that CORT injection may be correlated with the circadian clock by impairing circadian rhythms or shifting the phase values of clock genes. We also showed that CORT-treated mice exhibited a significant gradual reduction in body weight gain with increased oxidative stress, including reduced activity of antioxidant-related enzymes, reduced glutathione:glutathione disulfide ratio and cytochrome (Cyt)-C level, and elevated reactive oxygen species content. Moreover, chronic CORT injection affected inflammatory responses, the production of mitochondrial ATP and telomere shortening, which may be associated with the Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) signaling pathway. Additionally, chronic CORT injection disrupted the circadian rhythms of some indexes of aging phenotypes and altered the phase values of these indexes. Our findings suggest that psychologically stressful conditions such as depression are linked to changes in circadian rhythms and age-related phenotypes.
28153924<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Correlations between Circadian Rhythms and Growth in Challenging Environments.<<>>In plants, the circadian system controls a plethora of processes, many with agronomic importance, such as photosynthesis, photoprotection, stomatal opening, and photoperiodic development, as well as molecular processes, such as gene expression. It has been suggested that modifying circadian rhythms may be a means to manipulate crops to develop improved plants for agriculture. However, there is very little information on how the clock influences the performance of crop plants. We used a noninvasive, high-throughput technique, based on prompt chlorophyll fluorescence, to measure circadian rhythms and demonstrated that the technique works in a range of plants. Using fluorescence, we analyzed circadian rhythms in populations of wild barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum) from widely different ecogeographical locations in the Southern Levant part of the Fertile Crescent, an area with a high proportion of the total genetic variation of wild barley. Our results show that there is variability for circadian traits in the wild barley lines. We observed that circadian period lengths were correlated with temperature and aspect at the sites of origin of the plants, while the amplitudes of the rhythms were correlated with soil composition. Thus, different environmental parameters may exert selection on circadian rhythms.
29144214<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian rhythms of trematode parasites: applying mixed models to test underlying patterns.<<>>Circadian rhythms of parasites and their hosts can influence processes such as transmission, pathology and life cycle evolution. For trematode parasites that depend on free-living infectious stages (i.e. cercariae) to move among host species, the timing of parasite release is hypothesized to increase the likelihood of contacting a host. Yet, a persistent challenge in studying such biorhythms involves selection of appropriate analytical techniques. Here, we extend a generalized linear mixed modelling (GLMM) framework to cosinor analyses, thereby allowing flexibility in the statistical distribution of the response variable, incorporation of multiple covariates and inclusion of hierarchical grouping effects. By applying this approach to 93 snails infected with trematode parasites from freshwater pond ecosystems, we detected non-random rhythms in six of eight species, with variation in both the timing of peak cercariae release (between 5:10 and 21:46 h) and its magnitude (between 13 and 386). The use of GLMM yielded more accurate and precise estimates of the cosinor parameters compared with classical least-squares (LS) based on a simulation-based sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the amplitude and rhythm-adjusted mean values from the LS models diverged from the true values at some limits. We highlight the importance of novel analytical approaches for evaluating parasite circadian rhythms and investigating their underlying mechanisms.
27577611<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>CRTC Potentiates Light-independent timeless Transcription to Sustain Circadian Rhythms in Drosophila.<<>>Light is one of the strongest environmental time cues for entraining endogenous circadian rhythms. Emerging evidence indicates that CREB-regulated transcription co-activator 1 (CRTC1) is a key player in this pathway, stimulating light-induced Period1 (Per1) transcription in mammalian clocks. Here, we demonstrate a light-independent role of Drosophila CRTC in sustaining circadian behaviors. Genomic deletion of the crtc locus causes long but poor locomotor rhythms in constant darkness. Overexpression or RNA interference-mediated depletion of CRTC in circadian pacemaker neurons similarly impairs the free-running behavioral rhythms, implying that Drosophila clocks are sensitive to the dosage of CRTC. The crtc null mutation delays the overall phase of circadian gene expression yet it remarkably dampens light-independent oscillations of TIMELESS (TIM) proteins in the clock neurons. In fact, CRTC overexpression enhances CLOCK/CYCLE (CLK/CYC)-activated transcription from tim but not per promoter in clock-less S2 cells whereas CRTC depletion suppresses it. Consistently, TIM overexpression partially but significantly rescues the behavioral rhythms in crtc mutants. Taken together, our data suggest that CRTC is a novel co-activator for the CLK/CYC-activated tim transcription to coordinate molecular rhythms with circadian behaviors over a 24-hour time-scale. We thus propose that CRTC-dependent clock mechanisms have co-evolved with selective clock genes among different species.
22653890<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>The colony environment, but not direct contact with conspecifics, influences the development of circadian rhythms in honey bees.<<>>Honey bee (Apis mellifera) workers emerge from the pupae with no circadian rhythms in behavior or brain clock gene expression but show strong rhythms later in life. This postembryonic development of circadian rhythms is reminiscent of that of infants of humans and other primates but contrasts with most insects, which typically emerge from the pupae with strong circadian rhythms. Very little is known about the internal and external factors regulating the ontogeny of circadian rhythms in bees or in other animals. We tested the hypothesis that the environment during early life influences the later expression of circadian rhythms in locomotor activity in young honey bees. We reared newly emerged bees in various social environments, transferred them to individual cages in constant laboratory conditions, and monitored their locomotor activity. We found that the percentage of rhythmic individuals among bees that experienced the colony environment for their first 48 h of adult life was similar to that of older sister foragers, but their rhythms were weaker. Sister bees isolated individually in the laboratory for the same period were significantly less likely to show circadian rhythms in locomotor activity. Bees experiencing the colony environment for only 24 h, or staying for 48 h with 30 same-age sister bees in the laboratory, were similar to bees individually isolated in the laboratory. By contrast, bees that were caged individually or in groups in single- or double-mesh enclosures inside a field colony were as likely to exhibit circadian rhythms as their sisters that were freely moving in the same colony. These findings suggest that the development of the circadian system in young adult honey bees is faster in the colony than in isolation. Direct contact with the queen, workers, or the brood, contact pheromones, and trophallaxis, which are all important means of communication in honey bees, cannot account for the influence of the colony environment, since they were all withheld from the bees in the double-mesh enclosures. Our results suggest that volatile pheromones, the colony microenvironment, or both influence the ontogeny of circadian rhythms in honey bees.
23385698<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian rhythm abnormalities.<<>>PURPOSE: This article reviews the recent advances in understanding of the fundamental properties of circadian rhythms and discusses the clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSDs). RECENT FINDINGS: Recent evidence strongly points to the ubiquitous influence of circadian timing in nearly all physiologic functions. Thus, in addition to the prominent sleep and wake disturbances, circadian rhythm disorders are associated with cognitive impairment, mood disturbances, and increased risk of cardiometabolic disorders. The recent availability of biomarkers of circadian timing in clinical practice has improved our ability to identify and treat these CRSDs. SUMMARY: Circadian rhythms are endogenous rhythms with a periodicity of approximately 24 hours. These rhythms are synchronized to the physical environment by social and work schedules by various photic and nonphotic stimuli. CRSDs result from a misalignment between the timing of the circadian rhythm and the external environment (eg, jet lag and shift work) or a dysfunction of the circadian clock or its afferent and efferent pathways (eg, delayed sleep-phase, advanced sleep-phase, non-24-hour, and irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorders). The most common symptoms of these disorders are difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance and excessive sleepiness that are associated with impaired social and occupational functioning. Effective treatment for most of the CRSDs requires a multimodal approach to accelerate circadian realignment with timed exposure to light, avoidance of bright light at inappropriate times, and adherence to scheduled sleep and wake times. In addition, pharmacologic agents are recommended for some of the CRSDs. For delayed sleep-phase, non-24-hour, and shift work disorders, timed low-dose melatonin can help advance or entrain circadian rhythms; and for shift work disorder, wake-enhancing agents such as caffeine, modafinil, and armodafinil are options for the management of excessive sleepiness.
25294583<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian rhythms in anesthesia and critical care medicine: potential importance of circadian disruptions.<<>>The rotation of the earth and associated alternating cycles of light and dark--the basis of our circadian rhythms--are fundamental to human biology and culture. However, it was not until 1971 that researchers first began to describe the molecular mechanisms for the circadian system. During the past few years, groundbreaking research has revealed a multitude of circadian genes affecting a variety of clinical diseases, including diabetes, obesity, sepsis, cardiac ischemia, and sudden cardiac death. Anesthesiologists, in the operating room and intensive care units, manage these diseases on a daily basis as they significantly affect patient outcomes. Intriguingly, sedatives, anesthetics, and the intensive care unit environment have all been shown to disrupt the circadian system in patients. In the current review, we will discuss how newly acquired knowledge of circadian rhythms could lead to changes in clinical practice and new therapeutic concepts.
29472844<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>F-spondin Is Essential for Maintaining Circadian Rhythms.<<>>The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the master pacemaker that drives circadian behaviors. SCN neurons have intrinsic, self-sustained rhythmicity that is governed by transcription-translation feedback loops. Intrinsic rhythms within the SCN do not match the day-night cycle and are therefore entrained by light-derived cues. Such cues are transmitted to the SCN by a class of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). In the present study, we sought to identify how axons from ipRGCs target the SCN. While none of the potential targeting cues identified appeared necessary for retinohypothalamic innervation, we unexpectedly identified a novel role for the extracellular matrix protein F-spondin in circadian behavior. In the absence of F-spondin, mice lost their ability to maintain typical intrinsic rhythmicity. Moreover, F-spondin loss results in the displacement of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing neurons, a class of neurons that are essential for maintaining rhythmicity among SCN neurons. Thus, this study highlights a novel role for F-spondin in maintaining circadian rhythms.
27524206<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Chronotype and circadian rhythm in bipolar disorder: A systematic review.<<>>Despite a complex relationship between mood, sleep and rhythm, the impact of circadian disruptions on bipolar disorder (BD) has not been clarified. The purpose of this systematic review was to define current evidence regarding chronotype and circadian rhythm patterns in BD patients. 42 studies were included, involving 3432 BD patients. Disruption of the biological rhythm was identified, even in drug-naive BD patients and independently of mood status. Daily profiles of melatonin levels and cortisol indicated a delayed phase. Depression was more frequently associated with circadian alterations than euthymia. Few studies evaluated mania, demonstrating irregular rhythms. Evening type was more common in BD adults. Studies about the influence of chronotype on depressive symptoms showed conflicting results. Only one investigation observed the influences of chronotype in mania, revealing no significant association. Effects of psychoeducation and lithium on rhythm in BD patients were poorly studied, demonstrating no improvement of rhythm parameters. Studies about genetics are incipient. In conclusion, disruption in circadian rhythm and eveningness are common in BD. Prospective research evaluating the impact of circadian disruption on mood symptoms, metabolism, seasonality, the influence of age and the effects of mood stabilizers are needed.
27343471<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Schizophrenia: the role of sleep and circadian rhythms in regulating dopamine and psychosis.<<>>Schizophrenia has long been associated with abnormalities in circadian rhythms and sleep. Up until now, there have been no thorough reviews of the potential mechanisms behind the myriad of circadian and sleep abnormalities observed in schizophrenia and psychosis. We present evidence of sleep playing an important role in psychosis predominantly mediated by dopaminergic pathways. A synthesis of both human and animal experimental work suggests that the interplay between sleep and dopamine is important in the generation and maintenance of psychosis. In particular, both animal and human data point to sleep disruption increasing dopamine release and sensitivity. Furthermore, elevated dopamine levels disrupt sleep and circadian rhythms. The synthesis of knowledge suggests that circadian rhythms, dopamine dysregulation, and psychosis are intricately linked. This suggests that treatment of circadian disturbance may be a useful target in improving the lives and symptoms of patients with schizophrenia.
30832370<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>The Effects of Indoor High Temperature on Circadian Rhythms of Human Work Efficiency.<<>>Indoor non-air-conditioned environments widely exist in the summer high temperature weather. The work efficiency of the people who stay indoors for a long time is seriously affected by the indoor high temperature. In this paper, the changes of the circadian rhythms of work efficiency in indoor high temperature environments were studied. Ten healthy subjects (five males and five females) were selected in the experiments randomly. In each experiment day, the maximum hourly outdoor temperature was selected as 28 degrees C, 32 degrees C, 36 degrees C, and 38 degrees C, respectively, to determine the experiment conditions. In each experiment condition, subjects' response time, accuracy rate, grip strength, work willingness, and physiological parameters were monitored for 24 consecutive hours. Meanwhile, the hourly outdoor temperatures of the experiment day were accessed from the weather report during the experiment. Then the cosinor method and statistical method were adopted. The results indicated that the response time, grip strength, and work willingness followed circadian rhythms. However, the accuracy rates of the Stroop color-word test (SCWT) and numeral inspection task (NIT) did not show an obvious circadian rhythm. The effects of high temperature on the circadian rhythms of grip strength and work willingness were mainly reflected in the decreases of the median and amplitude. The effects on the response time were mainly reflected in the decrease of the median. In addition, forehead temperature showed a significant negative correlation to response time, and it could be considered as a predictor to assess the level of work efficiency. This study gives an alternative method to replace direct measurement of the ability indices at work site and provides basic data of 24 consecutive hours, for showing changes in human work efficiency. It could be helpful to predict the low performance in advance to reduce occupational accidents.
28851698<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Uncovering the mystery of opposite circadian rhythms between mouse and human leukocytes in humanized mice.<<>>Many immune parameters show circadian rhythms during the 24-hour day in mammals. The most striking circadian oscillation is the number of circulating immune cells that display an opposite rhythm between humans and mice. The physiological roles and mechanisms of circadian variations in mouse leukocytes are well studied, whereas for humans they remain unclear because of the lack of a proper model. In this study, we found that consistent with their natural host species, mouse and human circulating leukocytes exhibited opposite circadian oscillations in humanized mice. This cyclic pattern of trafficking correlated well with the diurnal expression levels of C-X-C chemokine receptor 4, which were controlled by the intracellular hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha/aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like heterodimer. Furthermore, we also discovered that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases/mitogen-activated 2 had opposite effects between mice and humans in generating intracellular reactive oxygen species, which subsequently regulated HIF-1alpha expression. In conclusion, we propose humanized mice as a robust model for human circadian studies and reveal insights on a novel molecular clock network in the human circadian rhythm.
26144943<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Disruption of Circadian Rhythms and Sleep in Critical Illness and its Impact on Innate Immunity.<<>>The earth rotates on its axis around the sun, creating a day and night cycle, that caused the development of circadian rhythms. The circadian rhythm is primarily entrained by light, which is detected by the retina. Retinal ganglion cells project to a part of the hypothalamus termed suprachiasmatic nucleus. Here, we find the master molecular clock, composed of a transcription-translation-loop at its core. The master clock indirectly influences the innate immune system via different biological systems. Also, the master clock controls the peripheral clocks, which are present in innate immune cells. Here, circadian rhythm proteins influence the response of immune cells to pathogens. Furthermore, the master clock influences our sleep-pattern, the most important restorative physiological function. In critically ill patients the circadian rhythm is substantially altered, supporting a dysfunctional innate immune response. This review discusses recent basic science findings on the interaction of the circadian rhythm and the innate immune system. Furthermore we give an outlook on potential future therapeutic strategies.
25726988<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Sleep- and circadian rhythm-associated pathways as therapeutic targets in bipolar disorder.<<>>INTRODUCTION: Disruptions in sleep and circadian rhythms are observed in individuals with bipolar disorders (BD), both during acute mood episodes and remission. Such abnormalities may relate to dysfunction of the molecular circadian clock and could offer a target for new drugs. AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on clinical, actigraphic, biochemical and genetic biomarkers of BDs, as well as animal and cellular models, and highlights that sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances are closely linked to the susceptibility to BDs and vulnerability to mood relapses. As lithium is likely to act as a synchronizer and stabilizer of circadian rhythms, we will review pharmacogenetic studies testing circadian gene polymorphisms and prophylactic response to lithium. Interventions such as sleep deprivation, light therapy and psychological therapies may also target sleep and circadian disruptions in BDs efficiently for treatment and prevention of bipolar depression. EXPERT OPINION: We suggest that future research should clarify the associations between sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances and alterations of the molecular clock in order to identify critical targets within the circadian pathway. The investigation of such targets using human cellular models or animal models combined with 'omics' approaches are crucial steps for new drug development.
30324579<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Chronobiology in nephrology: the influence of circadian rhythms on renal handling of drugs and renal disease treatment.<<>>INTRODUCTION: Chronobiology studies the phenomenon of rhythmicity in living organisms. The circadian rhythms are genetically determined and regulated by external synchronizers (the daylight cycle). Several biological processes involved in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs are subjected to circadian variations. Chronopharmacology studies how biological rhythms influence pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and toxicity, and determines whether time-of-day administration modifies the pharmacological characteristics of the drug. Chronotherapy applies chronopharmacological studies to clinical treatments, determining the best biological time for dosing: when the beneficial effects are maximal and the incidence and/or intensity of related side effects and toxicity are minimal. Most water-soluble drugs or drug metabolites are eliminated by urine through the kidney. The rate of drug clearance in the urine depends on several intrinsic variables related to renal function including renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, the ability of the kidney to reabsorb or to secrete drugs, urine flow, and urine pH, which influences the degree of urine acidification. Curiously, all these variables present a circadian behavior in different mammalian models. CONCLUSION: The circadian rhythms have influence in the renal physiology, pathophysiology, and pharmacology, and these data should be taken into account in clinical nephrology practice.
30532130<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Coherency of circadian rhythms in the SCN is governed by the interplay of two coupling factors.<<>>Circadian clocks are autonomous oscillators driving daily rhythms in physiology and behavior. In mammals, a network of coupled neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is entrained to environmental light-dark cycles and orchestrates the timing of peripheral organs. In each neuron, transcriptional feedbacks generate noisy oscillations. Coupling mediated by neuropeptides such as VIP and AVP lends precision and robustness to circadian rhythms. The detailed coupling mechanisms between SCN neurons are debated. We analyze organotypic SCN slices from neonatal and adult mice in wild-type and multiple knockout conditions. Different degrees of rhythmicity are quantified by pixel-level analysis of bioluminescence data. We use empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) to characterize spatio-temporal patterns. Simulations of coupled stochastic single cell oscillators can reproduce the diversity of observed patterns. Our combination of data analysis and modeling provides deeper insight into the enormous complexity of the data: (1) Neonatal slices are typically stronger oscillators than adult slices pointing to developmental changes of coupling. (2) Wild-type slices are completely synchronized and exhibit specific spatio-temporal patterns of phases. (3) Some slices of Cry double knockouts obey impaired synchrony that can lead to co-existing rhythms ("splitting"). (4) The loss of VIP-coupling leads to desynchronized rhythms with few residual local clusters. Additional information was extracted from co-culturing slices with rhythmic neonatal wild-type SCNs. These co-culturing experiments were simulated using external forcing terms representing VIP and AVP signaling. The rescue of rhythmicity via co-culturing lead to surprising results, since a cocktail of AVP-antagonists improved synchrony. Our modeling suggests that these counter-intuitive observations are pointing to an antagonistic action of VIP and AVP coupling. Our systematic theoretical and experimental study shows that dual coupling mechanisms can explain the astonishing complexity of spatio-temporal patterns in SCN slices.
24760863<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide mediates circadian rhythms in mammalian olfactory bulb and olfaction.<<>>Accumulating evidence suggests that the olfactory bulbs (OBs) function as an independent circadian system regulating daily rhythms in olfactory performance. However, the cells and signals in the olfactory system that generate and coordinate these circadian rhythms are unknown. Using real-time imaging of gene expression, we found that the isolated olfactory epithelium and OB, but not the piriform cortex, express similar, sustained circadian rhythms in PERIOD2 (PER2). In vivo, PER2 expression in the OB of mice is circadian, approximately doubling with a peak around subjective dusk. Furthermore, mice exhibit circadian rhythms in odor detection performance with a peak at approximately subjective dusk. We also found that circadian rhythms in gene expression and odor detection performance require vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) or its receptor VPAC2R. VIP is expressed, in a circadian manner, in interneurons in the external plexiform and periglomerular layers, whereas VPAC2R is expressed in mitral and external tufted cells in the OB. Together, these results indicate that VIP signaling modulates the output from the OB to maintain circadian rhythms in the mammalian olfactory system.
26113641<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian rhythms. A protein fold switch joins the circadian oscillator to clock output in cyanobacteria.<<>>Organisms are adapted to the relentless cycles of day and night, because they evolved timekeeping systems called circadian clocks, which regulate biological activities with ~24-hour rhythms. The clock of cyanobacteria is driven by a three-protein oscillator composed of KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, which together generate a circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation. We show that KaiB flips between two distinct three-dimensional folds, and its rare transition to an active state provides a time delay that is required to match the timing of the oscillator to that of Earth's rotation. Once KaiB switches folds, it binds phosphorylated KaiC and captures KaiA, which initiates a phase transition of the circadian cycle, and it regulates components of the clock-output pathway, which provides the link that joins the timekeeping and signaling functions of the oscillator.
27997028<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Differential Sensitivity to Ethanol-Induced Circadian Rhythm Disruption in Adolescent and Adult Mice.<<>>BACKGROUND: Growing evidence supports a central role for the circadian system in alcohol use disorders, but few studies have examined this relationship during adolescence. In mammals, circadian rhythms are regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus, a biological clock whose timing is synchronized (reset) to the environment primarily by light (photic) input. Alcohol (ethanol [EtOH]) disrupts circadian timing in part by attenuating photic phase-resetting responses in adult rodents. However, circadian rhythms change throughout life and it is not yet known whether EtOH has similar effects on circadian regulation during adolescence. METHODS: General circadian locomotor activity was monitored in male C57BL6/J mice beginning in adolescence (P27) or adulthood (P61) in a 12-hour light, 12-hour dark photocycle for ~2 weeks to establish baseline circadian activity measures. On the day of the experiment, mice received an acute injection of EtOH (1.5 g/kg, i.p.) or equal volume saline 15 minutes prior to a 30-minute light pulse at Zeitgeber Time 14 (2 hours into the dark phase) and then were released into constant darkness (DD) for ~2 weeks to assess phase-resetting responses. Control mice of each age-group received injections but no light pulse prior to DD. RESULTS: While adults showed the expected decrease in photic phase-delays induced by acute EtOH, this effect was absent in adolescent mice. Adolescents also showed baseline differences in circadian rhythmicity compared to adults, including advanced photocycle entrainment, larger photic phase-delays, a shorter free-running (endogenous) circadian period, and greater circadian rhythm amplitude. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results indicate that adolescent mice are less sensitive to the effect of EtOH on circadian photic phase-resetting and that their daily activity rhythms are markedly different than those of adults.
26414405<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Depression-like behaviour in mice is associated with disrupted circadian rhythms in nucleus accumbens and periaqueductal grey.<<>>An association between circadian rhythms and mood regulation is well established, and disturbed circadian clocks are believed to contribute to the development of mood disorders, including major depressive disorder. The circadian system is coordinated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the master pacemaker in the hypothalamus that receives light input from the retina and synchronizes circadian oscillators in other brain regions and peripheral tissues. Lacking the tight neuronal network that couples single-cell oscillators in the SCN, circadian clocks outside the SCN may be less stable and more susceptible to disturbances, for example by clock gene mutations or uncontrollable stress. However, non-SCN circadian clocks have not been studied extensively in rodent models of mood disorders. In the present study, it was hypothesized that disturbances of local circadian clocks in mood-regulating brain areas are associated with depression-like behaviour in mice. Using the learned helplessness procedure, depression-like behaviour was evoked in mice bearing the PER2::LUC circadian reporter, and then circadian rhythms of PER2 expression were examined in brain slices from these mice using luminometry and bioluminescence imaging. It was found that helplessness is associated with absence of circadian rhythms in the nucleus accumbens and the periaqueductal grey, two of the most critical brain regions within the reward circuit. The current study provides evidence that susceptibility of mice to depression-like behaviour is associated with disturbed local circadian clocks in a subset of mood-regulating brain areas, but the direction of causality remains to be determined.
30615844<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>The connection of circadian rhythm to inflammatory bowel disease.<<>>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises a group of chronic, immune system-mediated inflammatory diseases that primarily affect the gastrointestinal tract. The pathogenesis of the intestinal lesions in IBD remains elusive, but the inflammation process could be the result of dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immune systems induced by genetic and environmental factors. In recent years, research has demonstrated a connection between environmental stressors that can influence day-night variations, also called circadian rhythms, and digestive health. In this review, we focus on alterations in the complex interactions between intestinal mucosa, microbial factors, and the immune response in the intestinal milieu. We introduce the mechanisms that establish circadian rhythms and their regulation by the circadian rhythm genes. Evidence of circadian variation in the defense mechanisms of the intestine and its implication in the maintenance of a healthy microbiota are presented. Disruption of the circadian system can increase the activity of the gut immune system and the release of inflammatory factors. The link between chronodisruption or circadian rhythm impairment and IBD demonstrated by experimental and clinical studies illustrates the potential impact of circadian rhythms on treatment of these diseases. Future studies that investigate aspects of this subject are warranted.
26714872<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>The Optic Lobes Regulate Circadian Rhythms of Olfactory Learning and Memory in the Cockroach.<<>>The cockroach, Leucophaea maderae, can be trained in an associative olfactory memory task by either classical or operant conditioning. When trained by classical conditioning, memory formation is regulated by a circadian clock, but once the memory is formed, it can be recalled at any circadian time. In contrast, when trained via operant conditioning, animals can learn the task at any circadian phase, but the ability to recall the long-term memory is tied to the phase of training. The optic lobes of the cockroach contain a circadian clock that drives circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, mating behavior, sensitivity of the compound eye to light, and the sensitivity of olfactory receptors in the antennae. To evaluate the role of the optic lobes in regulating learning and memory processes, the authors examined the effects of surgical ablation of the optic lobes on memory formation in classical conditioning and memory recall following operant conditioning. The effect of optic lobe ablation was to "rescue" the deficit in memory acquisition at a time the animals normally cannot learn and "rescue" the animal's ability to recall a memory formed by operant conditioning at a phase where memory was not normally expressed. The results suggested that the optic lobe pacemaker regulates these processes through inhibition at "inappropriate" times of day. As a pharmacological test of this hypothesis, the authors showed that injections of fipronil, an antagonist of GABA and glutamate-activated chloride channels, had the same effects as optic lobe ablation on memory formation and recall. The data suggest that the optic lobes contain the circadian clock(s) that regulate learning and memory processes via inhibition of neural processes in the brain.
25652815<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Genetics and epigenetics of circadian rhythms and their potential roles in neuropsychiatric disorders.<<>>Circadian rhythm alterations have been implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly those of sleep, addiction, anxiety, and mood. Circadian rhythms are known to be maintained by a set of classic clock genes that form complex mutual and self-regulatory loops. While many other genes showing rhythmic expression have been identified by genome-wide studies, their roles in circadian regulation remain largely unknown. In attempts to directly connect circadian rhythms with neuropsychiatric disorders, genetic studies have identified gene mutations associated with several rare sleep disorders or sleep-related traits. Other than that, genetic studies of circadian genes in psychiatric disorders have had limited success. As an important mediator of environmental factors and regulators of circadian rhythms, the epigenetic system may hold the key to the etiology or pathology of psychiatric disorders, their subtypes or endophenotypes. Epigenomic regulation of the circadian system and the related changes have not been thoroughly explored in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders. We argue for systematic investigation of the circadian system, particularly epigenetic regulation, and its involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders to improve our understanding of human behavior and disease etiology.
30227223<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian rhythms and rheumatoid arthritis.<<>>Circadian rhythms (Nobel prize for Medicine 2017) regulate, under action of biological clocks located both at the level of central nervous system and inside peripheral cells, several daily activities, embracing sleep, feeding times, energy metabolism, endocrine and immune functions with related pathological conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In RA the circadian rhythms impact on cellular functions, involving night synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, cell migration to inflamed tissues, phagocytosis, proliferative cell response and all are peaking at late night. In chronic inflammatory conditions such as RA, the amplitude of the circadian rhythm of the anti-inflammatory endogenous cortisol availability is not increased as expected and requested, which indicate a reduced night cortisol secretion under the adrenal chronic stress induced by the disease. Therefore, the prevention/treatment of the immune cell night hyperactivity, with related flare of cytokine synthesis and morning RA clinical symptoms, has been shown more effective when the availability of the exogenous glucocorticoids is obtained in the middle of the night (night release). The impressive positive results observed in RA patients treated with modified-night release prednisone with a low-dose chronotherapy, seem applicable even for other agents such as conventional NSAIDs and DMARDs, including the positive experimental and clinical results obtained by the night time daily administration of methotrexate. Interestingly, a very recent study showed that methotrexate upregulates important cell circadian genes, resulting in induction of apoptosis in synovial fibroblasts. The link between the circadian rhythms of the disease and the chronotherapy of RA is promising.
26020938<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Predicted Role of NAD Utilization in the Control of Circadian Rhythms during DNA Damage Response.<<>>The circadian clock is a set of regulatory steps that oscillate with a period of approximately 24 hours influencing many biological processes. These oscillations are robust to external stresses, and in the case of genotoxic stress (i.e. DNA damage), the circadian clock responds through phase shifting with primarily phase advancements. The effect of DNA damage on the circadian clock and the mechanism through which this effect operates remains to be thoroughly investigated. Here we build an in silico model to examine damage-induced circadian phase shifts by investigating a possible mechanism linking circadian rhythms to metabolism. The proposed model involves two DNA damage response proteins, SIRT1 and PARP1, that are each consumers of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), a metabolite involved in oxidation-reduction reactions and in ATP synthesis. This model builds on two key findings: 1) that SIRT1 (a protein deacetylase) is involved in both the positive (i.e. transcriptional activation) and negative (i.e. transcriptional repression) arms of the circadian regulation and 2) that PARP1 is a major consumer of NAD during the DNA damage response. In our simulations, we observe that increased PARP1 activity may be able to trigger SIRT1-induced circadian phase advancements by decreasing SIRT1 activity through competition for NAD supplies. We show how this competitive inhibition may operate through protein acetylation in conjunction with phosphorylation, consistent with reported observations. These findings suggest a possible mechanism through which multiple perturbations, each dominant during different points of the circadian cycle, may result in the phase advancement of the circadian clock seen during DNA damage.
29589511<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian Rhythms and Reproductive Phenology Covary in a Natural Plant Population.<<>>The circadian clock is a molecular timekeeper that matches endogenous rhythms in diverse traits with 24-h cycles in the external environment. Although a lack of clock resonance to the environment is detrimental to performance, clock phenotypes in wild populations nevertheless deviate substantially from the predicted optimal cycle length of 24 h, and significant genetic variation exists for circadian parameters. Here, we describe covariation between 2 traits considered to reflect adaptation to different aspects of temporal environmental heterogeneity, circadian rhythms (adaptation to daily environmental cycles) and flowering time (adaptation to seasonal cycles), in a Rocky Mountain population of the mustard Boechera stricta, a North American relative of Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that 18 families that differ in circadian period in leaf movement by 3.5 h expressed genetic diversity in first-year growth, reproductive phenology, vegetative size at reproduction, and starch concentration following vernalization. The families exhibited a large (~90-day) range in mean flowering time, even though the spatial scale of population sampling covered only a few hundred meters. Circadian period covaried with other traits such that longer-period families flowered earlier and at a larger size, a trait combination predicted to yield a fitness benefit in the wild. Circadian clock research in model systems has previously shown that mutations in clock genes influence phenology. Our results widen the scope of this research by illustrating a link between naturally segregating clock variation and reproductive phenology among wild genotypes, suggesting that the causes of genetic diversity in the clock lie partly in adaptation to seasonal environmental heterogeneity.
28525688<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>[Role of circadian rhythms and cellular clock in aging-related diseases].<<>>Almost all the functions of a living organism have circadian oscillations. Disturbance of circadian rhythms can be either a reason or a consequence of a number of diseases.

25453346<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Absence of circadian rhythms of preterm premature rupture of membranes and preterm placental abruption.<<>>PURPOSE: Data regarding circadian rhythm in the onset of spontaneous preterm premature rupture of membranes (PROM) and placental abruption (PA) cases are conflicting. We modeled the time of onset of preterm PROM and PA cases and examined if the circadian profiles varied based on the gestational age at delivery. METHODS: We used parametric and nonparametric methods, including trigonometric regression in the framework of generalized linear models, to test the presence of circadian rhythms in the time of onset of preterm PROM and PA cases among 395 women who delivered a singleton between 2009 and 2010 in Lima, Peru. RESULTS: We found a diurnal circadian pattern, with a morning peak at 07:32 AM (95% confidence interval, 05:46 AM-09:18 AM) among moderate preterm PROM cases (P value < .001), and some evidence of a diurnal circadian periodicity among PA cases in term infants (P value = .067). However, we did not find evidence of circadian rhythms in the time of onset of extremely or very preterm PROM (P value = .259) and preterm PA (P value = .224). CONCLUSIONS: The circadian rhythms of the time of onset of preterm PROM and PA cases varied based on gestational weeks at delivery. Although circadian rhythms were presented among moderate preterm PROM and term PA cases, there was no evidence of circadian rhythms among preterm PA and very or extremely preterm PROM cases, underlying other mechanisms associated with the time of onset.
29933957<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Epigenetics of Circadian Rhythms in Imprinted Neurodevelopmental Disorders.<<>>DNA sequence information alone cannot account for the immense variability between chromosomal alleles within diverse cell types in the brain, whether these differences are observed across time, cell type, or parental origin. The complex control and maintenance of gene expression and modulation are regulated by a multitude of molecular and cellular mechanisms that layer on top of the genetic code. The integration of genetic and environmental signals required for regulating brain development and function is achieved in part by a dynamic epigenetic landscape that includes DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNAs. These epigenetic mechanisms establish and maintain core biological processes, including genomic imprinting and entrainment of circadian rhythms. This chapter will focus on how the epigenetic layers of DNA methylation and long, noncoding RNAs interact with circadian rhythms at specific imprinted chromosomal loci associated with the human neurodevelopmental disorders Prader-Willi, Angelman, Kagami-Ogata, and Temple syndromes.
23575670<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Cryptochromes are critical for the development of coherent circadian rhythms in the mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus.<<>>Cryptochrome (Cry) 1 and Cry2 are regarded as critical components for circadian rhythm generation in mammals. Nevertheless, cultured suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of neonatal Cry double deficient (Cry1(-/-)/Cry2(-/-)) mice exhibit circadian rhythms that damp out in several cycles. Here, by combining bioluminescence imaging of Per1-luc and PER2::LUC with multielectrode recording, we show developmental changes in SCN circadian rhythms in Cry1(-/-)/Cry2(-/-) mice. At the tissue level, circadian rhythms are found in neonatal but not in adult SCN, whereas at the cellular level, rhythms are detected in both SCN. Cellular circadian rhythms are synchronized in neonates, but not in adults, indicating a loss of rhythm synchrony in the course of development. Synchronized circadian rhythms in adult Cry1(-/-)/Cry2(-/-) SCN are restored by coculture of neonatal, but not of juvenile, SCN. These findings indicate that CRY1 and CRY2 are necessary for the development of intercellular networks that subserve coherent rhythm expression in adult SCN.
28585194<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian Rhythms in Diet-Induced Obesity.<<>>The biological clocks of the circadian timing system coordinate cellular and physiological processes and synchronizes these with daily cycles, feeding patterns also regulates circadian clocks. The clock genes and adipocytokines show circadian rhythmicity. Dysfunction of these genes are involved in the alteration of these adipokines during the development of obesity. Food availability promotes the stimuli associated with food intake which is a circadian oscillator outside of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Its circadian rhythm is arranged with the predictable daily mealtimes. Food anticipatory activity is mediated by a self-sustained circadian timing and its principal component is food entrained oscillator. However, the hypothalamus has a crucial role in the regulation of energy balance rather than food intake. Fatty acids or their metabolites can modulate neuronal activity by brain nutrient-sensing neurons involved in the regulation of energy and glucose homeostasis. The timing of three-meal schedules indicates close association with the plasma levels of insulin and preceding food availability. Desynchronization between the central and peripheral clocks by altered timing of food intake and diet composition can lead to uncoupling of peripheral clocks from the central pacemaker and to the development of metabolic disorders. Metabolic dysfunction is associated with circadian disturbances at both central and peripheral levels and, eventual disruption of circadian clock functioning can lead to obesity. While CLOCK expression levels are increased with high fat diet-induced obesity, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha increases the transcriptional level of brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 (BMAL1) in obese subjects. Consequently, disruption of clock genes results in dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and obesity. Modifying the time of feeding alone can greatly affect body weight. Changes in the circadian clock are associated with temporal alterations in feeding behavior and increased weight gain. Thus, shift work is associated with increased risk for obesity, diabetes and cardio-vascular diseases as a result of unusual eating time and disruption of circadian rhythm.
28424270<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Significance of circadian rhythms in severely brain-injured patients: A clue to consciousness?<<>>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the presence of a circadian body temperature rhythm and behaviorally assessed consciousness levels in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC; i.e., vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome or minimally conscious state). METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we investigated the presence of circadian temperature rhythms across 6 to 7 days using external skin temperature sensors in 18 patients with DOC. Beyond this, we examined the relationship between behaviorally assessed consciousness levels and circadian rhythmicity. RESULTS: Analyses with Lomb-Scargle periodograms revealed significant circadian rhythmicity in all patients (range 23.5-26.3 hours). We found that especially scores on the arousal subscale of the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised were closely linked to the integrity of circadian variations in body temperature. Finally, we piloted whether bright light stimulation could boost circadian rhythmicity and found positive evidence in 2 out of 8 patients. CONCLUSION: The study provides evidence for an association between circadian body temperature rhythms and arousal as a necessary precondition for consciousness. Our findings also make a case for circadian rhythms as a target for treatment as well as the application of diagnostic and therapeutic means at times when cognitive performance is expected to peak.
31059735<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Musashi-2 and related stem cell proteins in the mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus and their potential role in circadian rhythms.<<>>BACKGROUND: The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the mammalian hypothalamus contains the master circadian clock of the body and an unusually large number of cells expressing stem cell-related proteins. These seemingly undifferentiated cells may serve in entrainment of the SCN circadian clock to light cycles or allow it to undergo neural plasticity important for modifying its rhythmic output signals. These cells may also proliferate and differentiate into neurons or glia in response to episodic stimuli or developmental events requiring alterations in the SCN's control of physiology and behavior. PROBLEM: To characterize expression of stem cell related proteins in the SCN and the effects of stem-like cells on circadian rhythms. METHODS: Explant cultures of mouse SCN were maintained in medium designed to promote survival and growth of stem cells but not neuronal cells. Several stem cell marker proteins including SRY-box containing gene 2 (SOX2), nestin, vimentin, octamer-binding protein 4 (OCT4), and Musashi RNA-binding protein 2 (MSI2) were identified by immunocytochemistry in histological sections from adult mouse SCN and in cultures of microdissected SCN. A bioinformatics analysis located potential SCN targets of MSI2 and related RNA-binding proteins. RESULTS: Cells expressing stem cell markers proliferated in culture. Immunostained brain sections and bioinformatics supported the view that MSI2 regulates immature properties of SCN neurons, potentially providing flexibility in SCN neural circuits. Explant cultures had ongoing mitotic activity, indicated by proliferating-cell nuclear antigen, and extensive cell loss shown by propidium iodide staining. Cells positive for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) that are highly enriched in the SCN were diminished in explant cultures. Despite neuronal cell loss, tissue remained viable for over 7 weeks in culture, as shown by bioluminescence imaging of explants prepared from SCN of Per1::luc transgenic mice. The circadian rhythm in SCN gene expression persisted in brain slice cultures in stem cell medium. Prominent, widespread expression of RNA-binding protein MSI2 supported the importance of posttranscriptional regulation in SCN functions and provided further evidence of stem-like cells. CONCLUSION: The results show that the SCN retains properties of immature neurons and these properties persist in culture conditions suitable for stem cells, where the SCN stem-like cells also proliferate. These properties may allow adaptive circadian rhythm adjustments. Further exploration should examine stem-like cells of the SCN in vivo, how they may affect circadian rhythms, and whether MSI2 serves as a master regulator of SCN stem-like properties.
27252212<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Evolutionary Endocrinology of Hormonal Rhythms: Juvenile Hormone Titer Circadian Polymorphism in Gryllus firmus.<<>>Daily rhythms for hormonal traits are likely widespread and important aspects of organismal (e.g., life history) adaptation. Yet they remain substantially understudied, especially with respect to variable rhythms within species. The cricket, Gryllus firmus, exhibits a genetically polymorphic circadian rhythm for the blood titer of the key hormone, juvenile hormone (JH). Gryllus firmus is also wing-polymorphic, consisting of a dispersing morph that delays reproduction and a flightless morph with substantially enhanced egg production. JH circadian phenotype strongly covaries with morph type: The blood JH titer is strongly rhythmic in multiple populations artificially-selected for the dispersing morph (LW(f) = long wings with functional flight muscles) and is essentially arrhythmic in populations selected for the SW (short-winged) morph. Association between JH titer cycle and LW(f) morph is also found in natural populations of G. firmus and in several related species in the field. This is one of the very few studies of endocrine titer variation in natural populations of an insect. The morph-specific cycle is underlain by a circadian rhythm in hormone biosynthesis, which in turn is underlain by a rhythm in a brain neuropeptide regulator of JH biosynthesis. The morph-specific JH titer circadian cycle is also strongly correlated with a morph-specific daily rhythm in global gene expression. This is currently the only example of a genetically-variable hormone circadian rhythm in both the laboratory and field that is strongly associated with an ecologically important polymorphism. The extensive information on the underlying causes of the morph-specific JH titer rhythm, coupled with the strong association between the JH circadian rhythm and wing polymorphism makes this system in G. firmus an exceptional experimental model to investigate the mechanisms underlying circadian hormonal adaptations. Genetic polymorphism for the JH titer circadian rhythm in G. firmus is discussed in context of circadian rhythms for endocrine traits reported for vertebrates and insects. Consequences of the failure to identify endocrine circadian rhythms on the accuracy of estimation of quantitative-genetic parameters, such as heritability and correlations between hormonal and fitness-related traits, are also discussed.
31035036<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Aging circadian rhythms and cannabinoids.<<>>Numerous aspects of mammalian physiology exhibit cyclic daily patterns known as circadian rhythms. However, studies in aged humans and animals indicate that these physiological rhythms are not consistent throughout the life span. The simultaneous development of disrupted circadian rhythms and age-related impairments suggests a shared mechanism, which may be amenable to therapeutic intervention. Recently, the endocannabinoid system has emerged as a complex signaling network, which regulates numerous aspects of circadian physiology relevant to the neurobiology of aging. Agonists of cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1) have consistently been shown to decrease neuronal activity, core body temperature, locomotion, and cognitive function. Paradoxically, several lines of evidence now suggest that very low doses of cannabinoids are beneficial in advanced age. One potential explanation for this phenomenon is that these drugs exhibit hormesis-a biphasic dose-response wherein low doses produce the opposite effects of higher doses. Therefore, it is important to determine the dose-, age-, and time-dependent effects of these substances on the regulation of circadian rhythms and other processes dysregulated in aging. This review highlights 3 fields-biological aging, circadian rhythms, and endocannabinoid signaling-to critically assess the therapeutic potential of endocannabinoid modulation in aged individuals. If the hormetic properties of exogenous cannabinoids are confirmed, we conclude that precise administration of these compounds may bidirectionally entrain central and peripheral circadian clocks and benefit multiple aspects of aging physiology.
26600101<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>The Neurobiology of Circadian Rhythms.<<>>There is a growing recognition that the coordinated timing of behavioral, physiologic, and metabolic circadian rhythms is a requirement for a healthy body and mind. In mammals, the primary circadian oscillator is the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is responsible for circadian coordination throughout the organism. Temporal homeostasis is recognized as a complex interplay between rhythmic clock gene expression in brain regions outside the SCN and in peripheral organs. Abnormalities in this intricate circadian orchestration may alter sleep patterns and contribute to the pathophysiology of affective disorders.
28920706<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Do night and around-the-clock firefighters' shift schedules induce deviation in tau from 24 hours of systolic and diastolic blood pressure circadian rhythms?<<>>Systolic (S) and diastolic (D) blood pressures (BP) [SBP and DBP] are circadian rhythmic with period (tau) in healthy persons assumed to be maintained at 24.0h. We tested this assumption in a sample of 30 healthy career (mean >12 yrs) 30-to-46 yr-old male Caucasian French firefighters (FFs) categorized into three groups according to work schedule and duties: Group A - 12 FFs working 12h day, 12h night, and occasionally 24h shifts and whose primary duties are firefighting plus paramedical and road rescue services; Group B - 9 FFs working mostly 12h day and 12h night shifts and whose duties are answering incoming emergency calls and coordinating service vehicle dispatch from fire stations with Group A personnel; Group C - 9 day shift (09:00-17:00h) FFs charged with administrative tasks. SBP and DBP, both in winter and in summer studies of the same FFs, were sampled by ambulatory BP monitoring every 1h between 06:00-23:00h and every 2h between 23:01-05:59h, respectively, their approximate off-duty wake and sleep spans, for 7 consecutive days. Activity (wrist actigraphy) was also sampled at 1-min intervals. Prominent tau of each variable was derived by a power spectrum program written for unequal-interval time series data, and between-group differences in incidence of tau not equal24h of FFs were assessed by chi square test. Circadian rhythm disruption (tau not equal24h) of either the SBP or DBP rhythm occurred almost exclusively in night and 24h shift FFs of Group A and B, but almost never in day shift FFs of Group C, and it was not associated with altered tau from 24.0h of the circadian activity rhythm. In summer, occurrence of tau not equal24 for FFs of Group A and B differed from that for FFs of Group C in SBP (p=0.042) and DBP (p=0.015); no such differences were found in winter (p>0.10). Overall, manifestation of prominent tau not equal24h of SBP or DBP time series was greater in summer than winter, 27.6% versus 16.7%, when workload of Group B FFs, i.e. number of incoming emergency telephone calls, and of Group A FFs, i.e. number of dispatches for provision of emergency services, was, respectively, two and fourfold greater and number of 12h night shifts worked by Group B FFs and number of 24h shifts worked by Group A FFs was, respectively, 92% and 25% greater. FFs of the three groups exhibited no winter-summer difference in tau not equal24h of SBP or SDP; however, tau not equal24h of DBP in Group B FFs was more frequent in summer than winter (p=0.046). Sleep/wake cycle disruption, sleep deprivation, emotional and physical stress, artificial light-at-night, and altered nutrient timings are hypothesized causes of tau not equal24h for BP rhythms of affected Groups A and B FFs, but with unknown future health effects.
26529643<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian rhythms of clock gene expression in the cerebellum of serotonin-deficient Pet-1 knockout mice.<<>>Serotonin plays an important role in the central regulation of circadian clock function. Serotonin levels are generally higher in the brain during periods of high activity, and these periods are in turn heavily regulated by the circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. However, the role of serotonin as a regulator of circadian rhythms elsewhere in the brain has not been extensively examined. In this study, we examined circadian rhythms of clock gene expression in the cerebellum in mice lacking the Pet-1 transcription factor, which results in a developed brain that is deficient in serotonin neurons. If serotonin helps to synchronize rhythms in brain regions other than the suprachiasmatic nucleus, we would expect to see differences in clock gene expression in these serotonin deficient mice. We found minor differences in the expression of Per1 and Per2 in the knockout mice as compared to wild type, but these differences were small and of questionable functional importance. We also measured the response of cerebellar clocks to injections of the serotonin agonist 8-OH-DPAT during the early part of the night. No effect on clock genes was observed, though the immediate-early gene Fos showed increased expression in wild type mice but not the knockouts. These results suggest that serotonin is not an important mediator of circadian rhythms in the cerebellum in a way that parallels its regulation of the circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus.
29405095<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Shift work cycle-induced alterations of circadian rhythms potentiate the effects of high-fat diet on inflammation and metabolism.<<>>Based on genetic models with mutation or deletion of core clock genes, circadian disruption has been implicated in the pathophysiology of metabolic disorders. Thus, we examined whether circadian desynchronization in response to shift work-type schedules is sufficient to compromise metabolic homeostasis and whether inflammatory mediators provide a key link in the mechanism by which alterations of circadian timekeeping contribute to diet-induced metabolic dysregulation. In high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, exposure to chronic shifts of the light-dark cycle (12 h advance every 5 d): 1) disrupts photoentrainment of circadian behavior and modulates the period of spleen and macrophage clock gene rhythms; 2) potentiates HFD-induced adipose tissue infiltration and activation of proinflammatory M1 macrophages; 3) amplifies macrophage proinflammatory cytokine expression in adipose tissue and bone marrow-derived macrophages; and 4) exacerbates diet-induced increases in body weight, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance in the absence of changes in total daily food intake. Thus, complete disruption of circadian rhythmicity or clock gene function as transcription factors is not requisite to the link between circadian and metabolic phenotypes. These findings suggest that macrophage proinflammatory activation and inflammatory signaling are key processes in the physiologic cascade by which dysregulation of circadian rhythmicity exacerbates diet-induced systemic insulin resistance and glucose intolerance.-Kim, S.-M., Neuendorff, N., Alaniz, R. C., Sun, Y., Chapkin, R. S., Earnest, D. J. Shift work cycle-induced alterations of circadian rhythms potentiate the effects of high-fat diet on inflammation and metabolism.
28779094<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Robust circadian clock oscillation and osmotic rhythms in inner medulla reflecting cortico-medullary osmotic gradient rhythm in rodent kidney.<<>>Circadian clocks in mammals function in most organs and tissues throughout the body. Various renal functions such as the glomerular filtration and excretion of electrolytes exhibit circadian rhythms. Although it has been reported that the expression of the clock genes composing molecular oscillators show apparent daily rhythms in rodent kidneys, functional variations of regional clocks are not yet fully understood. In this study, using macroscopic bioluminescence imaging method of the PER2::Luciferase knock-in mouse kidney, we reveal that strong and robust circadian clock oscillation is observed in the medulla. In addition, the osmotic pressure in the inner medulla shows apparent daily fluctuation, but not in the cortex. Quantitative-PCR analysis of the genes contributing to the generation of high osmotic pressure or the water re-absorption in the inner medulla, such as vasopressin receptors (V1aR, V2R), urea transporter (UT-A2) and water channel (Aqp2) show diurnal variations as well as clock genes. Deficiency of an essential clock gene Bmal1 impairs day-night variations of osmotic pressure gradient in the inner medulla, suggesting that circadian clocks in the medulla part of the kidney may regulate the circadian rhythm of cortico-medullary osmotic pressure gradient, and may contribute physiological day-night rhythm of urination.
28030993<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian rhythms and gene expression during mouse molar tooth development.<<>>OBJECTIVES: Incremental markings in dental enamel suggest that the circadian clock may influence the molecular underpinnings orchestrating enamel formation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) oscillate in a circadian pattern during tooth and enamel development. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Comparative gene and miRNA expression profiling of the first mandibular molar tooth germ isolated at different time-points during the light and night period was performed using microarrays and validated using real-time RT-PCR. Bioinformatic analysis was carried out using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), and TargetScan software was used in order to identify computationally predicted miRNA-mRNA target relationships. RESULTS: In total, 439 genes and 32 miRNAs exhibited significantly different (p < 0.05) levels of expression in the light phase compared with the night phase tooth germs. Genes involved in enamel formation, i.e. Amelx, Ambn, Amtn, and Odam, oscillated in a circadian pattern. Furthermore, the circadian clock genes, in particular Clock and Bmal1, oscillated in mouse molar tooth germ during 24-h intervals. The expression of Clock and Bmal1 was inversely correlated with the expression of miR-182 and miR-141, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MiRNAs, including miR-182 and miR-141, are involved in the control of peripheral circadian rhythms in the developing tooth by regulating the expression of genes coding for circadian transcription factors such as CLOCK and BMAL1. Regulation of circadian rhythms may be important for enamel phenotype, and the morphology of dental enamel may vary between individuals due to differences in circadian profiles.
25403440<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>p38 MAP kinase regulates circadian rhythms in Drosophila.<<>>The large repertoire of circadian rhythms in diverse organisms depends on oscillating central clock genes, input pathways for entrainment, and output pathways for controlling rhythmic behaviors. Stress-activated p38 MAP Kinases (p38K), although sparsely investigated in this context, show circadian rhythmicity in mammalian brains and are considered part of the circadian output machinery in Neurospora. We find that Drosophila p38Kb is expressed in clock neurons, and mutants in p38Kb either are arrhythmic or have a longer free-running periodicity, especially as they age. Paradoxically, similar phenotypes are observed through either transgenic inhibition or activation of p38Kb in clock neurons, suggesting a requirement for optimal p38Kb function for normal free-running circadian rhythms. We also find that p38Kb genetically interacts with multiple downstream targets to regulate circadian locomotor rhythms. More specifically, p38Kb interacts with the period gene to regulate period length and the strength of rhythmicity. In addition, we show that p38Kb suppresses the arrhythmic behavior associated with inhibition of a second p38Kb target, the transcription factor Mef2. Finally, we find that manipulating p38K signaling in free-running conditions alters the expression of another downstream target, MNK/Lk6, which has been shown to cycle with the clock and to play a role in regulating circadian rhythms. These data suggest that p38Kb may affect circadian locomotor rhythms through the regulation of multiple downstream pathways.
27256623<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Human adipose tissue expresses intrinsic circadian rhythm in insulin sensitivity.<<>>In humans, insulin sensitivity varies according to time of day, with decreased values in the evening and at night. Mechanisms responsible for the diurnal variation in insulin sensitivity are unclear. We investigated whether human adipose tissue (AT) expresses intrinsic circadian rhythms in insulin sensitivity that could contribute to this phenomenon. Subcutaneous and visceral AT biopsies were obtained from extremely obese participants (body mass index, 41.8 +/- 6.3 kg/m(2); 46 +/- 11 y) during gastric-bypass surgery. To assess the rhythm in insulin signaling, AKT phosphorylation was determined every 4 h over 24 h in vitro in response to different insulin concentrations (0, 1, 10, and 100 nM). Data revealed that subcutaneous AT exhibited robust circadian rhythms in insulin signaling (P < 0.00001). Insulin sensitivity reached its maximum (acrophase) around noon, being 54% higher than during midnight (P = 0.009). The amplitude of the rhythm was positively correlated with in vivo sleep duration (r = 0.53; P = 0.023) and negatively correlated with in vivo bedtime (r = -0.54; P = 0.020). No circadian rhythms were detected in visceral AT (P = 0.643). Here, we demonstrate the relevance of the time of the day for how sensitive AT is to the effects of insulin. Subcutaneous AT shows an endogenous circadian rhythm in insulin sensitivity that could provide an underlying mechanism for the daily rhythm in systemic insulin sensitivity.-Carrasco-Benso, M. P., Rivero-Gutierrez, B., Lopez-Minguez, J., Anzola, A., Diez-Noguera, A., Madrid, J. A., Lujan, J. A., Martinez-Augustin, O., Scheer, F. A. J. L., Garaulet, M. Human adipose tissue expresses intrinsic circadian rhythm in insulin sensitivity.
28318412<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Effects of Lithium and 2,4-Dichlorophenol on Zebrafish: Circadian Rhythm Disorder and Molecular Effects.<<>>The aim of this study was to investigate lithium and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP)-induced circadian rhythm disorder and their genome-wide effects in zebrafish. Zebrafish larvae were exposed to 250 ppm LiCl (n = 40) or 20 ppm 2,4-DCP. RNA was subsequently extracted and determined quantitatively. The mRNA levels of circadian clock-related genes, including clock1a, bmal1b, per2, and per1b, were determined. Microarray datasets were generated and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The mRNA levels of some upregulated and downregulated DEGs were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Finally, gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was applied to determine the roles of the DEGs. The mRNA expression levels of circadian rhythm-related genes in the daily cycle were significantly affected after incubation of zebrafish with LiCl and 2,4-DCP. Many genes were differentially expressed during the light phase (97 h) and RT-PCR validation tests revealed that the expression patterns of DEGs were in accordance with those obtained by microarray analysis. GO functional enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs in LiCl- and 2,4-DCP-treated groups were associated with signal transduction and development. Collectively, our findings indicate that LiCl and 2,4-DCP could affect signal transduction pathways and immune response, thereby inducing circadian rhythm disorder.
25208554<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian rhythm reprogramming during lung inflammation.<<>>Circadian rhythms are known to regulate immune responses in healthy animals, but it is unclear whether they persist during acute illnesses where clock gene expression is disrupted by systemic inflammation. Here we use a genome-wide approach to investigate circadian gene and metabolite expression in the lungs of endotoxemic mice and find that novel cellular and molecular circadian rhythms are elicited in this setting. The endotoxin-specific circadian programme exhibits unique features, including a divergent group of rhythmic genes and metabolites compared with the basal state and a distinct periodicity and phase distribution. At the cellular level, endotoxin treatment also alters circadian rhythms of leukocyte counts within the lung in a bmal1-dependent manner, such that granulocytes rather than lymphocytes become the dominant oscillating cell type. Our results show that inflammation produces a complex re-organization of cellular and molecular circadian rhythms that are relevant to early events in lung injury.
28973913<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Period2 3'-UTR and microRNA-24 regulate circadian rhythms by repressing PERIOD2 protein accumulation.<<>>We previously created two PER2::LUCIFERASE (PER2::LUC) circadian reporter knockin mice that differ only in the Per2 3'-UTR region: Per2::Luc, which retains the endogenous Per2 3'-UTR and Per2::LucSV, where the endogenous Per2 3'-UTR was replaced by an SV40 late poly(A) signal. To delineate the in vivo functions of Per2 3'-UTR, we analyzed circadian rhythms of Per2::LucSV mice. Interestingly, Per2::LucSV mice displayed more than threefold stronger amplitude in bioluminescence rhythms than Per2::Luc mice, and also exhibited lengthened free-running periods ( approximately 24.0 h), greater phase delays following light pulse, and enhanced temperature compensation relative to Per2::Luc Analysis of the Per2 3'-UTR sequence revealed that miR-24, and to a lesser degree miR-30, suppressed PER2 protein translation, and the reversal of this inhibition in Per2::LucSV augmented PER2::LUC protein level and oscillatory amplitude. Interestingly, Bmal1 mRNA and protein oscillatory amplitude as well as CRY1 protein oscillation were increased in Per2::LucSV mice, suggesting rhythmic overexpression of PER2 enhances expression of Per2 and other core clock genes. Together, these studies provide important mechanistic insights into the regulatory roles of Per2 3'-UTR, miR-24, and PER2 in Per2 expression and core clock function.
30363685<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Insights into the Role of Circadian Rhythms in Bone Metabolism: A Promising Intervention Target?<<>>Numerous physiological processes of mammals, including bone metabolism, are regulated by the circadian clock system, which consists of a central regulator, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and the peripheral oscillators of the BMAL1/CLOCK-PERs/CRYs system. Various bone turnover markers and bone metabolism-regulating hormones such as melatonin and parathyroid hormone (PTH) display diurnal rhythmicity. According to previous research, disruption of the circadian clock due to shift work, sleep restriction, or clock gene knockout is associated with osteoporosis or other abnormal bone metabolism, showing the importance of the circadian clock system for maintaining homeostasis of bone metabolism. Moreover, common causes of osteoporosis, including postmenopausal status and aging, are associated with changes in the circadian clock. In our previous research, we found that agonism of the circadian regulators REV-ERBs inhibits osteoclast differentiation and ameliorates ovariectomy-induced bone loss in mice, suggesting that clock genes may be promising intervention targets for abnormal bone metabolism. Moreover, osteoporosis interventions at different time points can provide varying degrees of bone protection, showing the importance of accounting for circadian rhythms for optimal curative effects in clinical treatment of osteoporosis. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about circadian rhythms and bone metabolism.
28817668<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Titanium biomaterials with complex surfaces induced aberrant peripheral circadian rhythms in bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells.<<>>Circadian rhythms maintain a high level of homeostasis through internal feed-forward and -backward regulation by core molecules. In this study, we report the highly unusual peripheral circadian rhythm of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) induced by titanium-based biomaterials with complex surface modifications (Ti biomaterial) commonly used for dental and orthopedic implants. When cultured on Ti biomaterials, human BMSCs suppressed circadian PER1 expression patterns, while NPAS2 was uniquely upregulated. The Ti biomaterials, which reduced Per1 expression and upregulated Npas2, were further examined with BMSCs harvested from Per1::luc transgenic rats. Next, we addressed the regulatory relationship between Per1 and Npas2 using BMSCs from Npas2 knockout mice. The Npas2 knockout mutation did not rescue the Ti biomaterial-induced Per1 suppression and did not affect Per2, Per3, Bmal1 and Clock expression, suggesting that the Ti biomaterial-induced Npas2 overexpression was likely an independent phenomenon. Previously, vitamin D deficiency was reported to interfere with Ti biomaterial osseointegration. The present study demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation significantly increased Per1::luc expression in BMSCs, though the presence of Ti biomaterials only moderately affected the suppressed Per1::luc expression. Available in vivo microarray data from femurs exposed to Ti biomaterials in vitamin D-deficient rats were evaluated by weighted gene co-expression network analysis. A large co-expression network containing Npas2, Bmal1, and Vdr was observed to form with the Ti biomaterials, which was disintegrated by vitamin D deficiency. Thus, the aberrant BMSC peripheral circadian rhythm may be essential for the integration of Ti biomaterials into bone.
26120978<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>[Sleep disorders and circadian rhythms in diseases of the cardiovascular system].<<>>OBJECTIVE: To study disturbances of sleep and circadian rhythms in patients with cardiovascular diseases taking into account the level of melatonin secretion and to optimize a complex approach to their treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included patients with cardiovascular diseases with- (n=121) and without (n=105) cerebrovascular diseases (CVD). All patients received melaxen in dose 3 mg daily 30-40 min before sleep. Examination of patients included assessment of neurological status, psychometric scales, the definition of circadian rhythm of the heart and blood pressure, determination of 6-SOMT in daily urine. RESULTS: Pathological changes in circadian rhythms affected sleep disturbances, emotional and cognitive disorders and were associated with a reduction in the level of 6-SOMT in the urine. These changes were most pronounced in patients with CVD and stroke. The inclusion of melaxen in the comprehensive regimen of treatment improved sleep, reduced mood disorders and normalized the circadian heart rate profile and blood pressure. CONCLUSION: The data obtained allowed to consider melaxen as an effective tool in the complex therapy of patients with CVD.
30621462<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>The fetal circadian rhythm in pregnancies complicated by pregestational diabetes is altered by maternal glycemic control and the morning cortisol concentration.<<>>Circadian rhythmicity is fundamental to human physiology, and is present even during fetal life in normal pregnancies. The impact of maternal endocrine disease on the fetal circadian rhythm is not well understood. The present study aimed to determine the fetal circadian rhythm in pregnancies complicated by pregestational diabetes mellitus (PGDM), compare it with a low-risk reference population, and identify the effects of maternal glycemic control and morning cortisol concentrations. Long-term fetal electrocardiogram recordings were made in 40 women with PGDM at 28 and 36 weeks of gestation. Two recordings were made in 18 of the women (45.0%) and one recording was made in 22 (55.0%). The mean fetal heart rate (fHR) and the fHR variation (root mean square of squared differences) were extracted in 1-min epochs, and circadian rhythmicity was detected by cosinor analysis. The study cohort was divided based on HbA1c levels and morning cortisol concentrations. Statistically, significant circadian rhythms in the fHR and the fHR variation were found in 45 (100%) and 44 (95.7%) of the 45 acceptable PGDM recordings, respectively. The rhythms were similar to those of the reference population. However, there was no statistically significant population-mean rhythm in the fHR among PGDM pregnancies at 36 weeks, indicating an increased interindividual variation. The group with higher HbA1c levels (>6.0%) had no significant population-mean fHR rhythm at 28 or 36 weeks, and no significant fHR-variation rhythm at 36 weeks. Similarly, the group with a lower morning cortisol concentration (</=8.8 microg/dl) had no significant population-mean fHR-variation rhythm at 28 and 36 weeks. These findings indicate that individual fetal rhythmicity is present in pregnancies complicated by PGDM. However, suboptimal maternal glycemic control and a lower maternal morning cortisol concentration are associated with a less-well-synchronized circadian system of the fetus.

Disruption of circadian rhythms markedly impacts homeostasis. In this Commentary, we present data that disruption of circadian rhythm may lead to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative states. In this context, we further argue that there is an urgent need of developing new generations of compounds, chronobiotics, to modulate the molecular substrates of circadian timing system. Chronobiotics conceptually offer an effective way for restoration and protection from the consequences of the circadian disruption. We also briefly discuss whether dysfunctional circadian rhythms are a major driver of aging. Drug Dev Res 77 : 469-473, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
29351091<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian Rhythms Disturbances in Alzheimer Disease: Current Concepts, Diagnosis, and Management.<<>>The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the research regarding circadian rhythms in Alzheimer disease (AD). Furthermore, this paper explores the role of melatonin in the pathogenesis of AD and the limitation of trials addressing circadian rhythms disturbances in the AD population. A literature search using Medline with PubMed and Embase was carried out identifying papers focusing on circadian rhythms in AD. Sleep disorders and especially circadian rhythm disturbances are very common in the elderly population but definitely more pronounced in patients with AD. The lack of trials evaluating the management of circadian rhythms disorders in the elderly population and especially in AD should be considered of the utmost importance. Although there is a better understanding about the pathophysiology of AD and its relationship with circadian disorders, further studies in human models need to be conducted.
25620199<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Phase advancing human circadian rhythms with morning bright light, afternoon melatonin, and gradually shifted sleep: can we reduce morning bright-light duration?<<>>OBJECTIVE: Efficient treatments to phase-advance human circadian rhythms are needed to attenuate circadian misalignment and the associated negative health outcomes that accompany early-morning shift work, early school start times, jet lag, and delayed sleep phase disorder. This study compared three morning bright-light exposure patterns from a single light box (to mimic home treatment) in combination with afternoon melatonin. METHODS: Fifty adults (27 males) aged 25.9 +/- 5.1 years participated. Sleep/dark was advanced 1 h/day for three treatment days. Participants took 0.5 mg of melatonin 5 h before the baseline bedtime on treatment day 1, and an hour earlier each treatment day. They were exposed to one of three bright-light (~5000 lux) patterns upon waking each morning: four 30-min exposures separated by 30 min of room light (2-h group), four 15-min exposures separated by 45 min of room light (1-h group), and one 30-min exposure (0.5-h group). Dim-light melatonin onsets (DLMOs) before and after treatment determined the phase advance. RESULTS: Compared to the 2-h group (phase shift = 2.4 +/- 0.8 h), smaller phase-advance shifts were seen in the 1-h (1.7 +/- 0.7 h) and 0.5-h (1.8 +/- 0.8 h) groups. The 2-h pattern produced the largest phase advance; however, the single 30-min bright-light exposure was as effective as 1 h of bright light spread over 3.25 h, and it produced 75% of the phase shift observed with 2 h of bright light. CONCLUSIONS: A 30-min morning bright-light exposure with afternoon melatonin is an efficient treatment to phase-advance human circadian rhythms.
31063912<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Flutolanil affects circadian rhythm in zebrafish (Danio rerio) by disrupting the positive regulators.<<>>Circadian rhythms are fundamental to behavior and physiology of organisms. Flutolanil as a fungicide is toxic to zebrafish embryos. The aims of this study were to determine whether flutolanil would influence circadian rhythms of zebrafish and the mechanism involved. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to flutolanil (0, 0.125, 0.5 and 2mg/L) for 4 days. Here we report that flutolanil increased the melatonin levels of zebrafish. The mRNA levels of genes related to circadian rhythms were significantly altered. The clock level was significantly increased, but the content of cry1 showed no apparent changes. Moreover, our findings that the level of GH was significantly decreased were consistent with the abnormal development of zebrafish embryos. The expression levels of genes related to development, behavior and reproduction were significantly altered by flutolanil. These results indicate that flutolanil disturbed circadian rhythms of zebrafish primarily by affecting the positive elements, which were at least in partial responsible for abnormal development and behavior of zebrafish. And we speculate that flutolanil is toxic to zebrafish embryos at least in part via dysregulation of circadian rhythms involving clock.
27626074<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Differential roles of AVP and VIP signaling in the postnatal changes of neural networks for coherent circadian rhythms in the SCN.<<>>The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the site of the master circadian clock in mammals. The SCN neural network plays a critical role in expressing the tissue-level circadian rhythm. Previously, we demonstrated postnatal changes in the SCN network in mice, in which the clock gene products CRYPTOCHROMES (CRYs) are involved. Here, we show that vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) signaling is essential for the tissue-level circadian PER2::LUC rhythm in the neonatal SCN of CRY double-deficient mice (Cry1,2 (-/-) ). VIP and arginine vasopressin (AVP) signaling showed redundancy in expressing the tissue-level circadian rhythm in the SCN. AVP synthesis was significantly attenuated in the Cry1,2 (-/-) SCN, which contributes to aperiodicity in the adult mice together with an attenuation of VIP signaling as a natural process of ontogeny. The SCN network consists of multiple clusters of cellular circadian rhythms that are differentially integrated by AVP and VIP signaling, depending on the postnatal period.
26394143<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>A Novel Bmal1 Mutant Mouse Reveals Essential Roles of the C-Terminal Domain on Circadian Rhythms.<<>>The mammalian circadian clock is an endogenous biological timer comprised of transcriptional/translational feedback loops of clock genes. Bmal1 encodes an indispensable transcription factor for the generation of circadian rhythms. Here, we report a new circadian mutant mouse from gene-trapped embryonic stem cells harboring a C-terminus truncated Bmal1 (Bmal1GTDeltaC) allele. The homozygous mutant (Bmal1GTDeltaC/GTDeltaC) mice immediately lost circadian behavioral rhythms under constant darkness. The heterozygous (Bmal1+/GTDeltaC) mice displayed a gradual loss of rhythms, in contrast to Bmal1+/- mice where rhythms were sustained. Bmal1GTDeltaC/GTDeltaC mice also showed arrhythmic mRNA and protein expression in the SCN and liver. Lack of circadian reporter oscillation was also observed in cultured fibroblast cells, indicating that the arrhythmicity of Bmal1GTDeltaC/GTDeltaC mice resulted from impaired molecular clock machinery. Expression of clock genes exhibited distinct responses to the mutant allele in Bmal1+/GTDeltaC and Bmal1GTDeltaC/GTDeltaC mice. Despite normal cellular localization and heterodimerization with CLOCK, overexpressed BMAL1GTDeltaC was unable to activate transcription of Per1 promoter and BMAL1-dependent CLOCK degradation. These results indicate that the C-terminal region of Bmal1 has pivotal roles in the regulation of circadian rhythms and the Bmal1GTDeltaC mice constitute a novel model system to evaluate circadian functional mechanism of BMAL1.
28506462<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>A Slow Conformational Switch in the BMAL1 Transactivation Domain Modulates Circadian Rhythms.<<>>The C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of BMAL1 (brain and muscle ARNT-like 1) is a regulatory hub for transcriptional coactivators and repressors that compete for binding and, consequently, contributes to period determination of the mammalian circadian clock. Here, we report the discovery of two distinct conformational states that slowly exchange within the dynamic TAD to control timing. This binary switch results from cis/trans isomerization about a highly conserved Trp-Pro imide bond in a region of the TAD that is required for normal circadian timekeeping. Both cis and trans isomers interact with transcriptional regulators, suggesting that isomerization could serve a role in assembling regulatory complexes in vivo. Toward this end, we show that locking the switch into the trans isomer leads to shortened circadian periods. Furthermore, isomerization is regulated by the cyclophilin family of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases, highlighting the potential for regulation of BMAL1 protein dynamics in period determination.
27998755<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian rhythms accelerate wound healing in female Siberian hamsters.<<>>Circadian rhythms (CRs) provide temporal regulation and coordination of numerous physiological traits, including immune function. CRs in multiple aspects of immune function are impaired in rodents that have been rendered circadian-arrhythmic through various methods. In Siberian hamsters, circadian arrhythmia can be induced by disruptive light treatments (DPS). Here we examined CRs in wound healing, and the effects of circadian disruption on wound healing in DPS-arrhythmic hamsters. Circadian entrained/rhythmic (RHYTH) and behaviorally-arrhythmic (ARR) female hamsters were administered a cutaneous wound either 3h after light onset (ZT03) or 2h after dark onset (ZT18); wound size was quantified daily using image analyses. Among RHYTH hamsters, ZT03 wounds healed faster than ZT18 wounds, whereas in ARR hamsters, circadian phase did not affect wound healing. In addition, wounds healed slower in ARR hamsters. The results document a clear CR in wound healing, and indicate that the mere presence of organismal circadian organization enhances this aspect of immune function. Faster wound healing in CR-competent hamsters may be mediated by CR-driven coordination of the temporal order of mechanisms (inflammation, leukocyte trafficking, tissue remodeling) underlying cutaneous wound healing.
28851928<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Calorie restriction effects on circadian rhythms in gene expression are sex dependent.<<>>The rhythms in the expression of circadian clock genes are affected by calorie restriction (CR), a dietary paradigm known to increase lifespan. Many physiological effects of CR differ between males and females; here we investigated if the sex of animals affects the CR induced changes in the circadian rhythms. The liver expression of some circadian clock genes such as Bmal1 and three Periods (Per1, Per2 and Per3) and the effect of CR on the expression of these genes were sex independent, while the expression of Rev-Erb alpha, Ror gamma and both Cryptochome (Cry1 and Cry2) genes was different between males and females. The effect of CR on Rev-Erb alpha, Ror gamma and Cry1 gene expression was sex dependent. The expression and the effects of CR were sex-specific for several genes previously reported to be regulated by CR: Fmo3, Mup4, Serpina12 and Cyp4a12, while the expression of Cyp4a14a was sex independent. IGF signaling plays an important role in aging and CR effects. Igf-1 expression is regulated by CR and by the circadian clock, we found that rhythms in Igf-1 expression have sexual dimorphism. Our data provide molecular evidence that the sex of animals is an important modulator of circadian rhythms in gene expression and their response to CR.
28244020<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Air Travel, Circadian Rhythms/Hormones, and Autoimmunity.<<>>Biological rhythms are fundamental for homeostasis and have recently been involved in the regulatory processes of various organs and systems. Circadian cycle proteins and hormones have a direct effect on the inflammatory response and have shown pro- or anti-inflammatory effects in animal models of autoimmune diseases. The cells of the immune system have their own circadian rhythm, and the light-dark cycle directly influences the inflammatory response. On the other hand, patients with autoimmune diseases characteristically have sleep disorders and fatigue, and in certain disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a frank periodicity in the signs and symptoms is recognized. The joint symptoms predominate in the morning, and apparently, subjects with RA have relative adrenal insufficiency, with a cortisol peak unable to control the late night load of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Transatlantic flights represent a challenge in the adjustment of biological rhythms, since they imply sleep deprivation, time zone changes, and potential difficulties for drug administration. In patients with autoimmune diseases, the use of DMARDs and prednisone at night is probably best suited to lessen morning symptoms. It is also essential to sleep during the trip to improve adaptation to the new time zone and to avoid, as far as possible, works involving flexible or nocturnal shifts. The study of proteins and hormones related to biological rhythms will demonstrate new pathophysiological pathways of autoimmune diseases, which will emphasize the use of general measures for sleep respect and methods for drug administration at key daily times to optimize their anti-inflammatory and immune modulatory effects.
25512305<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian rhythms, the molecular clock, and skeletal muscle.<<>>Circadian rhythms are the approximate 24-h biological cycles that function to prepare an organism for daily environmental changes. They are driven by the molecular clock, a transcriptional:translational feedback mechanism that in mammals involves the core clock genes Bmal1, Clock, Per1/2, and Cry1/2. The molecular clock is present in virtually all cells of an organism. The central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) has been well studied, but the clocks in the peripheral tissues, such as heart and skeletal muscle, have just begun to be investigated. Skeletal muscle is one of the largest organs in the body, comprising approximately 45% of total body mass. More than 2300 genes in skeletal muscle are expressed in a circadian pattern, and these genes participate in a wide range of functions, including myogenesis, transcription, and metabolism. The circadian rhythms of skeletal muscle can be entrained both indirectly through light input to the SCN and directly through time of feeding and activity. It is critical for the skeletal muscle molecular clock not only to be entrained to the environment but also to be in synchrony with rhythms of other tissues. When circadian rhythms are disrupted, the observed effects on skeletal muscle include fiber-type shifts, altered sarcomeric structure, reduced mitochondrial respiration, and impaired muscle function. Furthermore, there are detrimental effects on metabolic health, including impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, which skeletal muscle likely contributes to considering it is a key metabolic tissue. These data indicate a critical role for skeletal muscle circadian rhythms for both muscle and systems health. Future research is needed to determine the mechanisms of molecular clock function in skeletal muscle, identify the means by which skeletal muscle entrainment occurs, and provide a stringent comparison of circadian gene expression across the diverse tissue system of skeletal muscle.
29894760<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian rhythms of melatonin and behaviour in juvenile sheep in field conditions: Effects of photoperiod, environment and weaning.<<>>Entrainment of circadian rhythms (CR) to the light dark cycle has been well described under controlled, experimental conditions. However, studies in rodents have reported that rhythms in the laboratory are not always reproduced under field conditions. The aim of this study was to characterise the CR of sheep maintained under conditions of standard UK farm animal husbandry and to investigate the effects of environmental challenges presented by season, weaning and changes in housing on CR. Male sheep (n=9) were kept at pasture, or group housed in barns, under natural photoperiod for one year. CR in locomotor activity were monitored using accelerometry, and 24h patterns in plasma cortisol and melatonin were measured every 4h by ELISA. CR was measured before and after weaning, in summer and winter, and at pasture and by barn housing. Cosinor analysis revealed high amplitude, diurnal rhythms in locomotor activity that were disrupted by weaning and by barn housing. Rhythms in winter showed an interrupted night time activity pattern, but only when the sheep were kept at pasture. Cortisol and melatonin secretion followed typical circadian patterns in winter and summer. The CR of the sheep under the field conditions of this study were strikingly robust under basal conditions, but easily disrupted by environmental challenges. Interrupted patterns of activity during the long nights of wintertime, not previously reported for sheep kept in experimental conditions were recorded. Based on these findings, we propose that animals require exposure to more complex environments than the laboratory in order to exhibit their true circadian phenotype.
25210113<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Physiological links between circadian rhythms, metabolism and nutrition.<<>>Circadian rhythms, metabolism and nutrition are closely interlinked. A great deal of recent research has investigated not only how aspects of metabolic physiology are driven by circadian clocks, but also how these circadian clocks are themselves sensitive to metabolic change. At the cellular level, novel feedback loops have been identified that couple circadian 'clock genes' and their proteins to expression of nuclear receptors, regulation of redox state and other major pathways. Using targeted disruption of circadian clocks, mouse models are providing novel insight into the role of tissue-specific clocks in glucose homeostasis and body weight regulation. The relationship between circadian rhythms and obesity appears complex, with variable alteration of rhythms in obese individuals. However, it is clear from animal studies that the timing and nutritional composition of meals can regulate circadian rhythms, particularly in peripheral tissues. Translation of these findings to human physiology now represents an important goal.
24954773<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Introduction: circadian rhythm and its disruption: impact on reproductive function.<<>>Almost all forms of life have predictable daily or circadian rhythms in molecular, endocrine, and behavioral functions. In mammals, a central pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei coordinates the timing of these rhythms. Daily light exposure that affects the retina of the eye directly influences this area, which is required to align endogenous processes to the appropriate time of day. The present "Views and Reviews" articles discuss the influence of circadian rhythms, especially nightly secretion of melatonin, on reproductive function and parturition. In addition, an examination is made of problems that arise from recurrent circadian rhythm disruption associated with changes in light exposure patterns common to modern day society. Finally, a possible solution to prevent disruptions in circadian phase markers by filtering out short wavelengths from nocturnal light is reviewed.
25968901<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Hyperuricaemia is associated with renal damage independently of hypertension and intrarenal renin-angiotensin system activation, as well as their circadian rhythms.<<>>AIM: Both hyperuricaemia and activation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) play an important role in the development of hypertension and renal damage. However, it has not been clear whether hyperuricaemia is associated with renal damage due to hypertension or intrarenal RAS activation, as well as their circadian rhythms. METHODS: We recruited 43 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients who did not receive RAS blockers and antihyperuricaemic drugs, and investigated the relationship among serum uric acid (sUA) levels, the circadian rhythm of urinary angiotensinogen (U-AGT) excretion levels, and the levels of albuminuria (U-ACR) and proteinuria (U-P/Cr). RESULTS: sUA levels were significantly associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (P = 0.002), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (daytime, P = 0.031), and U-ACR (daytime, P = 0.006 and nighttime, P = 0.008) and U-P/Cr (daytime, P = 0.017 and nighttime, P = 0.013). However, there were no significant differences between sUA levels and SBP in nighttime and U-AGT excretion levels in both time periods. Multiple regression analyses for sUA levels were performed using age, sex, eGFR and each parameter (SBP, U-AGT/Cr, U-ACR or U-P/Cr). sUA levels were not associated with SBP or U-AGT/Cr in both time periods. sUA levels tended to correlate with U-P/Cr levels in nighttime, and were significantly associated with U-P/Cr in daytime (P = 0.026) and U-ACR in daytime (P = 0.017) and nighttime (P = 0.046). Moreover, no significant differences were found between sUA levels and night-to-day ratios of some parameters. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that hyperuricaemia is associated with renal damage, independently of hypertension and intrarenal RAS activation, as well as their circadian rhythms.
27545669<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Molecular circadian rhythm shift due to bright light exposure before bedtime is related to subthreshold bipolarity.<<>>This study examined the link between circadian rhythm changes due to bright light exposure and subthreshold bipolarity. Molecular circadian rhythms, polysomnography, and actigraphy data were studied in 25 young, healthy male subjects, divided into high and low mood disorder questionnaire (MDQ) score groups. During the first 2 days of the study, the subjects were exposed to daily-living light (150 lux) for 4 hours before bedtime. Saliva and buccal cells were collected 5 times a day for 2 consecutive days. During the subsequent 5 days, the subjects were exposed to bright light (1,000 lux), and saliva and buccal cell samples were collected in the same way. Molecular circadian rhythms were analyzed using sine regression. Circadian rhythms of cortisol (F = 16.956, p < 0.001) and relative PER1/ARNTL gene expression (F = 122.1, p < 0.001) showed a delayed acrophase in both groups after bright light exposure. The high MDQ score group showed a significant delay in acrophase compared to the low MDQ score group only in salivary cortisol (F = 8.528, p = 0.008). The high MDQ score group showed hypersensitivity in cortisol rhythm shift after bright light exposure, suggesting characteristic molecular circadian rhythm changes in the high MDQ score group may be related to biological processes downstream from core circadian clock gene expression.
28713080<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Clinical and psychopathological characteristics of the autoagressive behavior in patients with the first psychotic episode with considering circadian rhythms.<<>>INTRODUCTION: The high rate of autoagressive action in patients with psychotic symptoms manifested during the beginning of active psychopharmatherapy, and they are often the reason for psychiatric help. The continuous growth of autoagressive behavior indicates the number of unsolved problems in clinical suicidology. AIM: The aim of this research was to explore the clinical and psychopathological characteristics of the autoagressive behavior in patients with the first psychotic episode with considering circadian rhythms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: There was a research in regional clinical psychiatric hospital and 130 patients were involved in the research with autoagressive behavior during the first psychotic episodes. Clinical and psychopathological, psychodiagnostic and statistical methods were used. Characteristic clinical manifestations of first psychotic episode is determined by PANSS [1986] and BPRS [1962], level of suicidal risk is determined by Lyuban-Plotstsa's scale [2000], characteristics of biological rhythms is established by Estberg's questionnaire [1986]. RESULTS: Certain psychiatric symptoms were associated with the level of suicide risk in the first episode of psychosis, such as <<tension", <<hostility", <<mannerisms and posturing, <<excitement>>, <<suspiciousness>>, <<somatic concern>>, <<anxiety>>, <<depression>>, <<guilt>>. Circadian rhythms include the level of risk occurrence and severity autoagressive behavior such as clearly and dimly expressed evening types of daily activity. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, further research of autoagression during the first psychotic episode with considering the influence of biological rhythms is a given area of current research in psychiatry aimed to improve the prevention, treatment and rehabilitation.
26660098<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>On the Role of Histamine Receptors in the Regulation of Circadian Rhythms.<<>>Several lines of evidence suggest a regulatory role of histamine in circadian rhythms, but little is known about signaling pathways that would be involved in such a putative role. The aim of this study was to examine whether histamine mediates its effects on the circadian system through Hrh1 or Hrh3 receptors. We assessed both diurnal and free-running locomotor activity rhythms of Hrh1-/- and Hrh3-/- mice. We also determined the expression of Per1, Per2 and Bmal1 genes in the suprachiasmatic nuclei, several areas of the cerebral cortex and striatum under symmetric 24 h light-dark cycle at zeitgeber times 14 and 6 by using radioactive in situ hybridization. We found no differences between Hrh1-/- and wild type mice in the length, amplitude and mesor of diurnal and free-running activity rhythms as well as in expression of Per1, Per2 and Bmal1 genes in any of the examined brain structures. The amplitude of free-running activity rhythm of the Hrh3-/- mice was significantly flattened, whereas the expression of the clock genes in Hrh3-/- mice was similar to the wild type animals in all of the assessed brain structures. Therefore, the knockout of Hrh1 receptor had no effects on the circadian rhythm of spontaneous locomotion, and a knockout of Hrh3 receptor caused a substantial reduction of free-running activity rhythm amplitude, but none of these knockout models affected the expression patterns of the core clock genes in any of the studied brain structures.
28934261<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Light entrainment of the murine intraocular pressure circadian rhythm utilizes non-local mechanisms.<<>>PURPOSE: Intraocular pressure (IOP) is known to have a strong circadian rhythm, yet how light/dark cycles entrain this rhythm is unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess whether, like the retina, the mammalian ciliary body and IOP clocks have an intrinsic ability to entrain to light/dark cycles. METHODS: Iris-ciliary body complexes were obtained from period2:luciferase (PER2::LUC) mice and cultured to measure bioluminescence rhythmicity. Pairs of the iris-ciliary body complex were exposed to antiphasic 9:15 h light/dark cycle in vitro. After 4 days of exposure to light/dark cycles, bioluminescence was recorded to establish their circadian phases. In addition, pairs of the iris-ciliary body complex co-cultured with the retinas or corneas of wild-type mice were also investigated. The IOP circadian changes of free-running Opn4-/-;rd1/rd1 mice whose behavior was antiphasic to wild-type were measured by a rebound tonometry, and compared with wild-type mice. Opn3, Opn4, and Opn5 mRNA expression in the iris-ciliary body were analyzed using RT-PCR. RESULTS: The iris/ciliary body complex expressed Opn3, Opn4, and Opn5 mRNA; however, unlike in retina and cornea, neither the iris-CB complex nor the co-cultured complex was directly entrained by light-dark cycle in vitro. The diurnal IOP change of Opn4-/-;rd1/rd1 mice showed an antiphasic pattern to wild-type mice and their rhythms followed the whole-animal behavioral rhythm. CONCLUSIONS: Despite expressing mRNA for several non-visual opsins, circadian rhythms of the iris-ciliary body complex of mice do not entrain directly to light-dark cycles ex vivo. Unlike retina, the iris/ciliary body clocks of blind mice remain synchronized to the organismal behavioral rhythm rather than local light-dark cycles. These results suggest that IOP rhythm entrainment is mediated by a systemic rather than local signal in mice.
24412370<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Studying circadian rhythms in Drosophila melanogaster.<<>>Circadian rhythms have a profound influence on most bodily functions: from metabolism to complex behaviors. They ensure that all these biological processes are optimized with the time-of-day. They are generated by endogenous molecular oscillators that have a period that closely, but not exactly, matches day length. These molecular clocks are synchronized by environmental cycles such as light intensity and temperature. Drosophila melanogaster has been a model organism of choice to understand genetically, molecularly and at the level of neural circuits how circadian rhythms are generated, how they are synchronized by environmental cues, and how they drive behavioral cycles such as locomotor rhythms. This review will cover a wide range of techniques that have been instrumental to our understanding of Drosophila circadian rhythms, and that are essential for current and future research.
25662277<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian rhythms in glucose and lipid metabolism in nocturnal and diurnal mammals.<<>>Most aspects of energy metabolism display clear variations during day and night. This daily rhythmicity of metabolic functions, including hormone release, is governed by a circadian system that consists of the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus (SCN) and many secondary clocks in the brain and peripheral organs. The SCN control peripheral timing via the autonomic and neuroendocrine system, as well as via behavioral outputs. The sleep-wake cycle, the feeding/fasting rhythm and most hormonal rhythms, including that of leptin, ghrelin and glucocorticoids, usually show an opposite phase (relative to the light-dark cycle) in diurnal and nocturnal species. By contrast, the SCN clock is most active at the same astronomical times in these two categories of mammals. Moreover, in both species, pineal melatonin is secreted only at night. In this review we describe the current knowledge on the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism by central and peripheral clock mechanisms. Most experimental knowledge comes from studies in nocturnal laboratory rodents. Nevertheless, we will also mention some relevant findings in diurnal mammals, including humans. It will become clear that as a consequence of the tight connections between the circadian clock system and energy metabolism, circadian clock impairments (e.g., mutations or knock-out of clock genes) and circadian clock misalignments (such as during shift work and chronic jet-lag) have an adverse effect on energy metabolism, that may trigger or enhancing obese and diabetic symptoms.
27995565<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>A New Perspective for Parkinson's Disease: Circadian Rhythm.<<>>Circadian rhythm is manifested by the behavioral and physiological changes from day to night, which is controlled by the pacemaker and its regulator. The former is located at the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in the anterior hypothalamus, while the latter is composed of clock genes present in all tissues. Circadian desynchronization influences normal patterns of day-night rhythms such as sleep and alertness cycles, rest and activity cycles. Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibits diurnal fluctuations. Circadian dysfunction has been observed in PD patients and animal models, which may result in negative consequences to the homeostasis and even exacerbate the disease progression. Therefore, circadian therapies, including light stimulation, physical activity, dietary and social schedules, may be helpful for PD patients. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the circadian dysfunction in PD remain elusive. Further research on circadian patterns is needed. This article summarizes the existing research on the circadian rhythms in PD, focusing on the clinical symptom variations, molecular changes, as well as the available treatment options.
28017879<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian rhythms, time-restricted feeding, and healthy aging.<<>>Circadian rhythms optimize physiology and health by temporally coordinating cellular function, tissue function, and behavior. These endogenous rhythms dampen with age and thus compromise temporal coordination. Feeding-fasting patterns are an external cue that profoundly influence the robustness of daily biological rhythms. Erratic eating patterns can disrupt the temporal coordination of metabolism and physiology leading to chronic diseases that are also characteristic of aging. However, sustaining a robust feeding-fasting cycle, even without altering nutrition quality or quantity, can prevent or reverse these chronic diseases in experimental models. In humans, epidemiological studies have shown erratic eating patterns increase the risk of disease, whereas sustained feeding-fasting cycles, or prolonged overnight fasting, is correlated with protection from breast cancer. Therefore, optimizing the timing of external cues with defined eating patterns can sustain a robust circadian clock, which may prevent disease and improve prognosis.
30862458<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>The physiological significance of the circadian dynamics of the HPA axis: Interplay between circadian rhythms, allostasis and stress resilience.<<>>Circadian time-keeping mechanisms preserve homeostasis by synchronizing internal physiology with predictable variations in the environment and temporally organize the activation of physiological signaling mechanisms to promote survival and optimize the allocation of energetic resources. In this paper, we highlight the importance of the robust circadian dynamics of allostatic mediators, with a focus on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, for the optimal regulation of host physiology and in enabling organisms to adequately respond and adapt to physiological stressors. We review studies showing how the chronic disruption of circadian rhythms can result in the accumulation of allostatic load, which impacts the appropriate functioning of physiological systems and diminishes the resilience of internal systems to adequately respond to subsequent stressors. A careful consideration of circadian rhythm dynamics leads to a more comprehensive characterization of individual variability in allostatic load and stress resilience. Finally, we suggest that the restoration of circadian rhythms after pathological disruption can enable the re-engagement of allostatic mechanisms and re-establish stress resilience.
28981604<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>An individual 12-h shift of the light-dark cycle alters the pancreatic and duodenal circadian rhythm and digestive function.<<>>In mammals, behavioral and physiological rhythms are controlled by circadian clocks which are entrained by environmental light and food signals. However, how the environmental cues affect digestive tract's circadian clock remains poorly understood. Therefore, in order to elucidate the effect of light cue on the resetting of the peripheral clocks, we investigated the expressions of clock genes (Bmal1, Cry1, Rev-erbalpha, Per1, and Per2) and digestive function genes (Cck, Cck-1r, Sct, Sctr, and Ctrb1) in the pancreas and duodenum of rats after the light-dark (LD) cycle reversal for 7 days. We found that both the clock genes and digestive function genes exhibited a clear and similar daily rhythmicity in the pancreas and duodenum of rats. After reversal of the LD cycle for 7 days, the expressions of clock genes in pancreas, including Bmal1, Cry1, and Rev-erbalpha were affected; whereas the expression of Per1 gene failed to fit the cosine wave. However, in the duodenum the shifted genes were Bmal1, Rev-erbalpha, and Per2; in parallel, the Per1 gene expression also lost its circadian rhythm by reversal of the LD cycle. Therefore, the acrophases of the clock genes were shifted in a tissue- and gene-specific manner. Furthermore, the profiles of the digestive function genes, including Sctr and Ctrb1, were also affected by changes in LD cycle. These observations suggest that the mechanisms underlying the pancreatic and duodenal clocks are distinct, and there may be a potential linkage between the circadian clock system and the digestive system.
27104378<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Timing Matters: Circadian Rhythm in Sepsis, Obstructive Lung Disease, Obstructive Sleep Apnea, and Cancer.<<>>Physiological and cellular functions operate in a 24-hour cyclical pattern orchestrated by an endogenous process known as the circadian rhythm. Circadian rhythms represent intrinsic oscillations of biological functions that allow for adaptation to cyclic environmental changes. Key clock genes that affect the persistence and periodicity of circadian rhythms include BMAL1/CLOCK, Period 1, Period 2, and Cryptochrome. Remarkable progress has been made in our understanding of circadian rhythms and their role in common medical conditions. A critical review of the literature supports the association between circadian misalignment and adverse health consequences in sepsis, obstructive lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and malignancy. Circadian misalignment plays an important role in these disease processes and can affect disease severity, treatment response, and survivorship. Normal inflammatory response to acute infections, airway resistance, upper airway collapsibility, and mitosis regulation follows a robust circadian pattern. Disruption of normal circadian rhythm at the molecular level affects severity of inflammation in sepsis, contributes to inflammatory responses in obstructive lung diseases, affects apnea length in obstructive sleep apnea, and increases risk for cancer. Chronotherapy is an underused practice of delivering therapy at optimal times to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity. This approach has been shown to be advantageous in asthma and cancer management. In asthma, appropriate timing of medication administration improves treatment effectiveness. Properly timed chemotherapy may reduce treatment toxicities and maximize efficacy. Future research should focus on circadian rhythm disorders, role of circadian rhythm in other diseases, and modalities to restore and prevent circadian disruption.
30947602<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Involvement of the Clock Gene period in the Circadian Rhythm of the Silkmoth Bombyx mori.<<>>In Lepidoptera, the roles of period ( per) and the negative feedback involving this gene in circadian rhythm are controversial. In the present study, we established a per knockout strain using TALEN in Bombyx mori, and compared eclosion and hatching rhythms between the per-knockout and wild-type strains to examine whether per is actually involved in these rhythms. The generated per knockout allele was considered null, because it encoded an extensively truncated form of PERIOD (198 aa due to a 64-bp deletion in exon 7, in contrast to 1113 aa in the wild-type protein). In this per knockout strain, circadian rhythms in eclosion and hatching were disrupted. Under LD cycles, however, a steep peak existed at 1 h after lights-on in both eclosion and hatching, and was considered to be produced by a masking effect-a direct response to light. In the per-knockout strain, temporal expression changes of per and timeless ( tim) were also lost. The expression levels of tim were continuously high, probably due to the loss of negative feedback by per and tim. In contrast, the expression levels of per were much lower in the per knockout strain than in the wild type at every time point. From these results, we concluded that per is indispensable for circadian rhythms, and we suggest that the negative feedback loop of the circadian rhythm involving per functions for the production of behavioral rhythms in B. mori.
24388969<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Why the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) should be measured before treatment of patients with circadian rhythm sleep disorders.<<>>Treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSD) may include light therapy, chronotherapy and melatonin. Exogenous melatonin is increasingly being used in patients with insomnia or CRSD. Although pharmacopoeias and the European food safety authority (EFSA) recommend administering melatonin 1-2 h before desired bedtime, several studies have shown that melatonin is not always effective if administered according to that recommendation. Crucial for optimal treatment of CRSD, melatonin and other treatments should be administered at a time related to individual circadian timing (typically assessed using the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO)). If not administered according to the individual patient's circadian timing, melatonin and other treatments may not only be ineffective, they may even result in contrary effects. Endogenous melatonin levels can be measured reliably in saliva collected at the patient's home. A clinically reliably DLMO can be calculated using a fixed threshold. Diary and polysomnographic sleep-onset time do not reliably predict DLMO or circadian timing in patients with CRSD. Knowing the patient's individual circadian timing by assessing DLMO can improve diagnosis and treatment of CRSD with melatonin as well as other therapies such as light or chronotherapy, and optimizing treatment timing will shorten the time required to achieve results.
30994461<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Mood Prediction of Patients With Mood Disorders by Machine Learning Using Passive Digital Phenotypes Based on the Circadian Rhythm: Prospective Observational Cohort Study.<<>>BACKGROUND: Virtually, all organisms on Earth have their own circadian rhythm, and humans are no exception. Circadian rhythms are associated with various human states, especially mood disorders, and disturbance of the circadian rhythm is known to be very closely related. Attempts have also been made to derive clinical implications associated with mood disorders using the vast amounts of digital log that is acquired by digital technologies develop and using computational analysis techniques. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate the mood state or episode, activity, sleep, light exposure, and heart rate during a period of about 2 years by acquiring various digital log data through wearable devices and smartphone apps as well as conventional clinical assessments. We investigated a mood prediction algorithm developed with machine learning using passive data phenotypes based on circadian rhythms. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational cohort study on 55 patients with mood disorders (major depressive disorder [MDD] and bipolar disorder type 1 [BD I] and 2 [BD II]) for 2 years. A smartphone app for self-recording daily mood scores and detecting light exposure (using the installed sensor) were provided. From daily worn activity trackers, digital log data of activity, sleep, and heart rate were collected. Passive digital phenotypes were processed into 130 features based on circadian rhythms, and a mood prediction algorithm was developed by random forest. RESULTS: The mood state prediction accuracies for the next 3 days in all patients, MDD patients, BD I patients, and BD II patients were 65%, 65%, 64%, and 65% with 0.7, 0.69, 0.67, and 0.67 area under the curve (AUC) values, respectively. The accuracies of all patients for no episode (NE), depressive episode (DE), manic episode (ME), and hypomanic episode (HME) were 85.3%, 87%, 94%, and 91.2% with 0.87, 0.87, 0.958, and 0.912 AUC values, respectively. The prediction accuracy in BD II patients was distinctively balanced as high showing 82.6%, 74.4%, and 87.5% of accuracy (with generally good sensitivity and specificity) with 0.919, 0.868, and 0.949 AUC values for NE, DE, and HME, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the theoretical basis of chronobiology, this study proposed a good model for future research by developing a mood prediction algorithm using machine learning by processing and reclassifying digital log data. In addition to academic value, it is expected that this study will be of practical help to improve the prognosis of patients with mood disorders by making it possible to apply actual clinical application owing to the rapid expansion of digital technology.
28423243<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>[Role of circadian rhythms and cellular clock in aging cancer development].<<>>Almost all the body's functions exhibit circadian rhythm maintained in a cell by a system of Clock genes and proteins. Failure to synchronize or loss of these rhythms are found in aged organism and are associated with risk of cancer development. The article describes data on mechanisms of circadian rhythms regulation in whole organism and cell, rhythm change during aging and relationship between rhythm disturbances and tumorigenesis of different localisations in humans and animals.
29940798<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Aging Alters Circadian Rhythms in the Mouse Eye.<<>>The eye contains a circadian system that acts independently from the master circadian clock located in the brain. This circadian system regulates important physiological functions within the eye. Emerging experimental evidence also indicates that disruption of the ocular circadian clock, or its outputs, negatively affects the overall health of the eye. Although previous studies have investigated the effect of aging on the regulation of circadian rhythms, no study has investigated the effects of aging on the circadian rhythm in the ocular system. The aim of the present study was to investigate how aging affects the circadian rhythm of PER2::LUC bioluminescence in the retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and cornea. Our data suggest that among the 3 different ocular tissues investigated, the retina appears to be the most affected by aging whereas the RPE and cornea are less affected by aging. Our data, along with studies of other organs and tissues, suggest that reduction in the amplitude of rhythms is probably the most severe effect of aging on the circadian clock.
30744651<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>DA-JC1 improves learning and memory by antagonizing Abeta31-35-induced circadian rhythm disorder.<<>>Studies have shown that a normal circadian rhythm is crucial to learning and memory. Circadian rhythm disturbances that occur at early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) aggravate the progression of the disease and further reduce learning and memory in AD patients. The novel, dual GLP-1R/GIPR agonist DA-JC1 has been found to exert a stronger hypoglycemic effect than a GLP-1R agonist alone and has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects. However, it is not clear whether DA-JC1 improves the Abeta31-35-induced decline in learning and memory ability by restoring disrupted circadian rhythms. In the present study, we carried out a mouse wheel-running experiment and Morris water maze test (MWM) and found that DA-JC1 could effectively improve the decline of learning and memory and circadian rhythm disorders induced by Abeta31-35. After downregulating Per2 expression via lentivirus-shPer2 in the hippocampus and the hippocampal HT22 cells, we found that circadian rhythm disorders occurred, and that DA-JC1 could not improve the impaired learning and memory. These results suggest that DA-JC1 improves damage to learning and memory by antagonizing circadian rhythm disorders induced by Abeta31-35. The outcome of this ongoing study may provide a novel therapeutic intervention for AD in the future.
29778521<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Vasculature on the clock: Circadian rhythm and vascular dysfunction.<<>>The master mammalian circadian clock (i.e. central clock), located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, orchestrates the synchronization of the daily behavioural and physiological rhythms to better adapt the organism to the external environment in an anticipatory manner. This central clock is entrained by a variety of signals, the best established being light and food. However, circadian cycles are not simply the consequences of these two cues but are generated by endogenous circadian clocks. Indeed, clock machinery is found in mainly all tissues and cell types, including cells of the vascular system such as endothelial cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells and stem cells. This machinery physiologically contributes to modulate the daily vascular function, and its disturbance therefore plays a major role in the pathophysiology of vascular dysfunction. Therapies targeting the circadian rhythm may therefore be of benefit against vascular disease.
29378772<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian rhythms in mitochondrial respiration.<<>>Many physiological processes are regulated with a 24-h periodicity to anticipate the environmental changes of daytime to nighttime and vice versa. These 24-h regulations, commonly termed circadian rhythms, among others control the sleep-wake cycle, locomotor activity and preparation for food availability during the active phase (daytime for humans and nighttime for nocturnal animals). Disturbing circadian rhythms at the organ or whole-body level by social jetlag or shift work, increases the risk to develop chronic metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. The molecular basis of this risk is a topic of increasing interest. Mitochondria are essential organelles that produce the majority of energy in eukaryotes by converting lipids and carbohydrates into ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. To adapt to the ever-changing environment, mitochondria are highly dynamic in form and function and a loss of this flexibility is linked to metabolic diseases. Interestingly, recent studies have indicated that changes in mitochondrial morphology (i.e., fusion and fission) as well as generation of new mitochondria are dependent on a viable circadian clock. In addition, fission and fusion processes display diurnal changes that are aligned to the light/darkness cycle. Besides morphological changes, mitochondrial respiration also displays diurnal changes. Disturbing the molecular clock in animal models leads to abrogated mitochondrial rhythmicity and altered respiration. Moreover, mitochondrial-dependent production of reactive oxygen species, which plays a role in cellular signaling, has also been linked to the circadian clock. In this review, we will summarize recent advances in the study of circadian rhythms of mitochondria and how this is linked to the molecular circadian clock.
26841283<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian rhythm of calciotropic hormones, serum calcium, phosphorus and magnesium during the shortest and longest days of the year in horses in New Zealand.<<>>A study was conducted to determine the circadian rhythms and trends of vitamin D metabolites including 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 , 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone, in addition to serum calcium, phosphorus and magnesium concentrations in horses over 48 h on the shortest and longest days of the year in 2013. Five healthy adult horses (Equus caballus) were on a constant pasture feeding regimen, and blood samples were collected from each horse every 3 h over a 48-h period, starting at 07:00 PM on day one and finishing at 07:00 PM on day three, for the measurement of calciotropic hormones and electrolytes. There was a significant difference between the serum concentration of calciotropic hormones, iCa, tCa, P and tMg between the shortest (winter) and longest (summer) days of the year in horses. Serum concentration of 25OHD3 was very low and mostly undetectable. Serum iCa, 1,25(OH)2 D and PTH concentrations clearly showed a circadian rhythm on the longest days of the year and serum tCa, P and tMg concentrations showed a diurnal pattern on the longest days (summer) of the year. None of the analytes showed any circadian rhythm on the shortest days (winter) of the year. The result of this study could have significant relevance to equine athletes travelling to international equestrian competitions and facing a huge time and seasonal differences that might affect their ability to adjust their circadian rhythms to new time zones.
26970497<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Brief light exposure at night disrupts the circadian rhythms in eye growth and choroidal thickness in chicks.<<>>Changes in ocular growth that lead to myopia or hyperopia are associated with alterations in the circadian rhythms in eye growth, choroidal thickness and intraocular pressure in animal models of emmetropization. Recent studies have shown that light at night has deleterious effects on human health, acting via "circadian disruptions" of various diurnal rhythms, including changes in phase or amplitude. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of brief, 2-h episodes of light in the middle of the night on the rhythms in axial length and choroidal thickness, and whether these alter eye growth and refractive error in the chick model of myopia. Starting at 2 weeks of age, birds received 2 h of light between 12:00 am and 2:00 am for 7 days (n = 12; total hours of light: 14 h). Age-matched controls had a continuous dark night (n = 14; 14L/10D). Ocular dimensions were measured using high-frequency A-scan ultrasonography on the first day of the experiment, and again on day 7, at 6-h intervals, starting at noon (12 pm, 6 pm, 12 am, 6 am, 12 pm). Measurements during the night were done under a photographic safe-light. These data were used to determine rhythm parameters of phase and amplitude. 2 groups of birds, both experimental (light at night) and control, were measured with ultrasound at various intervals over the course of 4 weeks to determine growth rates. Refractive errors were measured in 6 experimental and 6 control birds at the end of 2 weeks. Eyes of birds in a normal L/D cycle showed sinusoidal 24-h period diurnal rhythms in axial length and choroid thickness. Light in the middle of the night caused changes in both the rhythms in axial length and choroidal thickness, such that neither could be fit to a sine function having a period of 24 h. Light caused an acute, transient stimulation in ocular growth rate in the subsequent 6-h period (12 am-6 am), that may be responsible for the increased growth rate seen 4 weeks later, and the more myopic refractive error. It also abolished the increase in choroidal thickness that normally occurs between 6 pm and 12 am. We conclude that light at night alters the rhythms in axial length and choroidal thickness in an animal model of eye growth, and that these circadian disruptions might lead to the development of ametropias. These results have implications for the use of light during the night in children.
27155052<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Synchronization to light and mealtime of the circadian rhythms of self-feeding behavior and locomotor activity of white shrimps (Litopenaeus vannamei).<<>>The role of light and feeding cycles in synchronizing self-feeding and locomotor activity rhythms was studied in white shrimps using a new self-feeding system activated by photocell trigger. In experiment 1, shrimps maintained under a 12:12h light/dark (LD) photoperiod were allowed to self-feed using feeders connected to a photoelectric cell, while locomotor activity was recorded with a second photocell. On day 30, animals were subjected to constant darkness (DD) for 12days to check the existence of endogenous circadian rhythms. In the experiment 2, shrimps were exposed to both a 12:12h LD photoperiod and a fixed meal schedule in the middle of the dark period (MD, 01:00h). On day 20, shrimps were exposed to DD conditions and the same fixed feeding. On day 30, they were maintained under DD and fasted for 7days. The results revealed that under LD, shrimps showed a clear nocturnal feeding pattern and locomotor activity (81.9% and 67.7% of total daily food-demands and locomotor activity, respectively, at nighttime). Both feeding and locomotor rhythms were endogenously driven and persisted under DD with an average period length (tau) close to 24h (circadian) (tau=24.18+/-0.13 and 23.87+/-0.14h for locomotor and feeding, respectively). Moreover, Shrimp showed a daily food intake under LD condition (1.1+/-0.2gday(-1) in the night phase vs. 0.2+/-0.1gday(-1) in the light phase). Our findings might be relevant for some important shrimp aquaculture aspects, such as developing suitable feeding management on shrimp farms.
28440811<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Evaluation of circadian phenotypes utilizing fibroblasts from patients with circadian rhythm sleep disorders.<<>>We evaluated the circadian phenotypes of patients with delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD) and non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder (N24SWD), two different circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSDs) by measuring clock gene expression rhythms in fibroblast cells derived from individual patients. Bmal1-luciferase (Bmal1-luc) expression rhythms were measured in the primary fibroblast cells derived from skin biopsy samples of patients with DSWPD and N24SWD, as well as control subjects. The period length of the Bmal1-luc rhythm (in vitro period) was distributed normally and was 22.80+/-0.47 (mean+/-s.d.) h in control-derived fibroblasts. The in vitro periods in DSWPD-derived fibroblasts and N24SWD-derived fibroblasts were 22.67+/-0.67 h and 23.18+/-0.70 h, respectively. The N24SWD group showed a significantly longer in vitro period than did the control or DSWPD group. Furthermore, in vitro period was associated with response to chronotherapy in the N24SWD group. Longer in vitro periods were observed in the non-responders (mean+/-s.d.: 23.59+/-0.89 h) compared with the responders (mean+/-s.d.: 22.97+/-0.47 h) in the N24SWD group. Our results indicate that prolonged circadian periods contribute to the onset and poor treatment outcome of N24SWD. In vitro rhythm assays could be useful for predicting circadian phenotypes and clinical prognosis in patients with CRSDs.
30301878<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian rhythms and psychiatric profiles in young adults with unipolar depressive disorders.<<>>Abnormalities in circadian rhythms have been reported in people with mood disorders, but these abnormalities are marked by considerable inter-individual variability. This study aimed to identify pathophysiological subgroups on the basis of circadian markers and evaluate how these subgroups relate to psychiatric profiles. Thirty-five young adults (18-31 years old) receiving clinical care for unipolar depressive disorders and 15 healthy controls took part to this study. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Young Mania rating scale were used to evaluate the severity of mood symptoms in participants with depressive disorders. All participant underwent ambulatory sleep monitoring with actigraphy for about 12 days before attending a laboratory-based chronobiological assessment which included repeated salivary samples to determine dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and continuous core body temperature (CBT) monitoring using an ingestible temperature sensor. Cluster analyses were conducted across all participants to identify subgroups with consistent circadian timing profiles based on DLMO and the nocturnal minima of CBT. Two clusters were identified: 'delayed' and 'conventional timing' circadian phase. Descriptive analyses showed that the delayed cluster was characterised by abnormal time relationships between circadian phase markers and the sleep-wake cycle. Importantly, individuals from the delayed cluster had worse depression severity (t(28) = -2.7, p = 0.011) and hypomanic symptoms (Z = -2.2, p = 0.041) than their peers with conventional circadian timing. These findings suggest that delayed and disorganised circadian rhythms may be linked to worse psychiatric profiles in young people with depressive disorders.
29807067<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Agomelatine treatment corrects symptoms of depression and anxiety by restoring the disrupted melatonin circadian rhythms of rats exposed to chronic constant light.<<>>Desynchronization of circadian rhythms is a hallmark of depression. The antidepressant agomelatine, which is an MT1/MT2 melatonin receptor agonist/5-HT2C serotonin receptor antagonist has advantages compared to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as a circadian phase-shifting agent. The present study was designed to explore whether agomelatine is able to have an antidepressant effect on rats exposed to chronic constant light (CCL) for 6weeks. Focus is also placed on whether this activity affects diurnal rhythms of depressive-like symptoms and is associated with restoration of impaired circadian rhythms in plasma melatonin and corticosterone. We report that CCL induced a depressive-like symptoms associated with decreased grooming in the splash test during the subjective light/inactive phase. Anhedonia-like deficit in the saccharine preference test and increased immobility in the forced swimming test were both detected during the subjective dark/active phase. The disturbed emotional fluctuations due to CCL were corrected by agomelatine treatment (40mg/kg, i.p. for 3weeks). Agomelatine also restored novelty-induced hypophagia, which reflects an anxiety state, during the subjective Light and Dark phase, respectively, in rats exposed to CCL. Parallel to the observed positive influence on behavior, this melatonin analogue restored impaired circadian patterns of plasma melatonin but not that of corticosterone. These findings demonstrated the antidepressant-like effect of agomelatine in rats exposed to CCL possibly exerted via correction of melatonin rhythms and are suggestive of the therapeutic potential of this drug in a subpopulation of people characterized by a melatonin deficit.
29673553<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>The discoveries of molecular mechanisms for the circadian rhythm: The 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.<<>>Circadian clocks evolved to allow plants and animals to adapt their behaviors to the 24-hr change in the external environment due to the Earth's rotation. While the first scientific observation of circadian rhythm in the plant leaf movement may be dated back to the early 18th century, it took 200 years to realize that the leaf movement is controlled by an endogenous circadian clock. The cloning and characterization of the first Drosophila clock gene period in the early 1980s, independently by Jeffery C. Hall and Michael Rosbash at Brandeis University and Michael Young at Rockefeller University, paved the way for their further discoveries of additional genes and proteins, culminating in establishing the so-called transcriptional translational feedback loop (TTFL) model for the generation of autonomous oscillator with a period of approximately 24 h. The 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to honor their discoveries of molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm.
30663431<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Progressive retinal ganglion cell loss in primary open-angle glaucoma is associated with temperature circadian rhythm phase delay and compromised sleep.<<>>Advanced primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is characterized by progressive retinal ganglion cell complex (RGCC) damage that may cause subsequent disruption of the circadian rhythms. Therefore, we evaluated circadian body temperature (BT) rhythm and sleep characteristics of 115 individuals (38 men and 77 women) diagnosed with POAG. GLV (global loss volume; %), a measure of RGCC damage, was estimated by high-definition optical coherence tomography, and RGC functional ability was assessed by pattern electroretinogram amplitude (PERGA). Depending on dynamics of POAG progression criteria, two groups were formed that were distinctively different in GLV: Stable POAG group (S-POAG; GLV = 5.95 +/- 1.84, n = 65) and Progressive POAG group (P-POAG; GLV = 24.27 +/- 5.09, n = 50). S-POAG and P-POAG groups were not different in mean age (67.61 +/- 7.56 versus 69.98 +/- 8.15) or body mass index (24.66 +/- 3.03 versus 24.77 +/- 2.90). All subjects performed 21 around-the-clock BT self-measurements during a 72-h period and kept activity/sleep diaries. Results showed pronounced disruption of circadian physiology in POAG and its progression with increasing severity of the disease. The daily mean of BT was unusually low, compared to age-matched controls. Moreover, our results revealed distinctive features of BT circadian rhythm alterations in POAG development and POAG progression. S-POAG is associated with lowered BT circadian rhythm robustness and inter-daily phase stability compared to controls. In the P-POAG group, the mean phase of the circadian BT rhythm was delayed by about 5 h and phases were highly scattered among individual patients, which led to reduced group mean amplitude. Circadian amplitudes of individuals were not different between the groups. Altogether, these results suggest that the body clock still works in POAG patients, but its entrainment to the 24-h environment is compromised. Probably because of the internal desynchronization, bedtime is delayed, and sleep duration is accordingly shortened by about 55 min in P-POAG compared to S-POAG patients. In the entire POAG cohort (both groups), later sleep phase and shorter mean sleep duration correlate with the delayed BT phase (r = 0.215; p = 0.021 and r = 0.322; p = 0.0004, respectively). An RGCC GLV of 15% apparently constitutes a threshold above which a delay of the circadian BT rhythm and a shortening of sleep duration occur.
30318979<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Influence of Schizophrenia-Associated Gene Egr3 on Sleep Behavior and Circadian Rhythms in Mice.<<>>Up to 80% of people meeting DSM-IV definitions for schizophrenia will exhibit difficulties with sleep, along with a breakdown in circadian entrainment and rhythmicity. The changes to the sleep and circadian systems in this population are thought to be interdependent, as evidenced by the frequent use of the combined term "sleep and circadian rhythm disruption" or "SCRD" to describe their occurrence. To understand links between sleep and circadian problems in the schizophrenia population, we analyzed the duration and rhythmicity of sleep behavior in mice lacking function of the immediate early gene early growth response 3 ( Egr3). EGR3 has been associated with schizophrenia risk in humans, and Egr3-deficient (-/-) mice display various features of schizophrenia that are responsive to antipsychotic treatment. While Egr3-/- mice slept less than their wildtype (WT) littermates, they showed no evidence of circadian disorganization; in fact, circadian rhythms of activity were more robust in these mice compared with WT, as measured by time series analysis and the relative amplitude index of Van Someren's suite of non-parametric circadian rhythm analyses. Differences in circadian robustness were maintained when the animals were transferred to several weeks of housing under constant darkness or constant light. Together, our results suggest that Egr3-/- mice retain control over the circadian timekeeping of sleep and wake, while showing impaired sleep. The findings are compatible with those from a surprising array of mouse models of schizophrenia and raise the possibility that SCRD may be 2 separate disorders in the schizophrenia population requiring different treatment strategies.
30971327<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Effects of Sodium Lighting On Circadian Rhythms in Rats.<<>>Rodent studies often must be conducted during an animal's active phase (that is, in darkness) yet also during a typical day shift for staff. Low-pressure sodium lighting (LPSL), to which human retinas are more sensitive than rodents' at low intensity, has been used to facilitate study conduct in dark phase. The assumption was that LPSL would be equivalent to total darkness due to low rodent retinal sensitivity but provide enough lighting for safe technical manipulations due to higher human retinal sensitivity. Unlike other light sources, LPSL has been tested for effects on circadian rhythm specific to locomotive activities in albino mice. Whether LPSL affects circadian rhythms in rats is unknown. In this study, circadian endpoints were derived from body temperature and locomotor activity via telemeters in 8 adult male Wistar rats. When moved from a 12:12-h white-light (that is, cold white fluorescent light):dark (LD) cycle to a 12:12-h white-light:sodium-light cycle, rats demonstrated free-running and disrupted circadian rhythms (that is, lengthened circadian period and reduced circadian robustness and amplitude). Body temperature and locomotor activity were significantly lower in the LPSL phase as compared with dark phase under the baseline condition. When exposed to a 12:12 h sodium-light:dark (SD) cycle, rats entrained with a circadian period similar to 12:12-h white-light:dark (LD), but significantly different from the period under constant darkness (DD). Circadian onset and acrophase were delayed under SD compared with LD. When illuminated with a LPSL pulse under DD, rats showed phase shifts similar to white-light pulse effects, consistent with the phase response curve. To determine whether the image-forming photoreceptors are involved in this process, we used electroretinography. Compared with white light, 589-nm light generated during electroretinography elicited rod photoreceptors responses with longer latency and cone photoreceptor responses with lower amplitude. These results indicate that LPSL is a weaker zeitgeber than white light and may alter the circadian system in rats. Furthermore, because LPSL appeared to be visible to rats, it may not be an appropriate substitute for actual darkness.
26558932<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>[Circadian rhythms and chronic diseases].<<>>Everything in nature and life is occurring in a rhythmic manner. The major "Zeitgeber" is the change of light and dark during a 24 h day. This circadian rhythm is besides others reflected in circadian rhythms of behaviors or different biochemical parameters. A disruption of the circadian rhythm has a high pathophysiological potential. In this article a few basic issues about the role of circadian rhythms and the pathophysiological importance of desynchronisation are reviewed.
28494142<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Blood pressure circadian rhythms and adverse outcomes in type 2 diabetes patients diagnosed with orthostatic hypotension.<<>>AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Patients with diabetes frequently develop orthostatic hypotension (OH). The present study was designed to examine the relationship of blood pressure (BP) circadian rhythms and outcomes in diabetes with OH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, 173 inpatients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled. Patients were divided into an OH group and a non-OH group according to the BP changes detected in the supine and standing position. Then, 24-h ambulatory BP was monitored. Patients were followed up for an average of 45 +/- 10 months post-discharge. Outcomes - death and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, including heart failure, myocardial infarction and stroke - were recorded. RESULTS: There were 61 patients (35.26%) in the OH group and 112 patients (64.74%) in the non-OH group. In the OH group, the night-time systolic BP and night-time diastolic BP were higher, the blood BP rhythms were predominantly of the riser type (67.21%). OH was as an independent marker of riser type circadian rhythm (adjusted odds ratio 4.532, 95% confidence interval 2.579-7.966). In the OH group, the incidence rates of mortality, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events were increased significantly compared with those in the non-OH group (11.48 vs 2.68%, P = 0.014; 37.70 vs 8.93%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In patients who had type 2 diabetes diagnosed with OH, the BP circadian rhythm usually showed riser patterns, and they had increased rates of mortality, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events.
30439372<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Depression caused by long-term stress regulates premature aging and is possibly associated with disruption of circadian rhythms in mice.<<>>Depression has been associated with circadian disruption and premature aging. Nevertheless, mechanisms underlying the link between long-term stress with premature aging and possible associations with circadian rhythms remain elusive. Here, mice were exposed to chronic mild stress for 16weeks to induce depression-like symptoms, which were confirmed with the open field test, tail suspension test, and sucrose preference test. Then, the circadian rhythms of age-related indexes were compared between control and stressed mice. Long-term stress resulted in decreased body weight gain and locomotor activities, accompanied by losses of subcutaneous backside fat, decreased amounts of thigh muscle fibers, and shortened telomere length in hepatocytes. Stressed mice showed increased oxidative damage, causing impaired mitochondrial function and inflammatory responses, which may be mediated by the sirtuin 3 (SIRT3)-superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) signaling pathway. These changes may be associated with partial disruption of circadian rhythms or shifting phase values of some age-related indicators induced by long-term stress. These findings suggest that long-term exposure to stress may increase the risk of depression and regulate age-related phenotypes through associations with circadian rhythms.
29172879<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Circadian Rhythms in Visual Responsiveness in the Behaviorally Arrhythmic Drosophila Clock Mutant Clk(Jrk).<<>>An organism's biological day is characterized by a pattern of anticipatory physiological and behavioral changes that are governed by circadian clocks to align with the 24-h cycling environment. Here, we used flash electroretinograms (ERGs) and steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) to examine how visual responsiveness in wild-type Drosophila melanogaster and the circadian clock mutant Clk(Jrk) varies over circadian time. We show that the ERG parameters of wild-type flies vary over the circadian day, with a higher luminance response during the subjective night. The SSVEP response that assesses contrast sensitivity also showed a time-of-day dependence, including 2 prominent peaks within a 24-h period and a maximal response at the end of the subjective day, indicating a tradeoff between luminance and contrast sensitivity. Moreover, the behaviorally arrhythmic Clk(Jrk) mutants maintained a circadian profile in both luminance and contrast sensitivity, but unlike the wild-types, which show bimodal profiles in their visual response, Clk(Jrk) flies show a weakening of the bimodal character, with visual responsiveness tending to peak once a day. We conclude that the Clk(Jrk) mutation mainly affects 1 of 2 functionally coupled oscillators and that the visual system is partially separated from the locomotor circadian circuits that drive bouts of morning and evening activity. As light exposure is a major mechanism for entrainment, our work suggests that a detailed temporal analysis of electrophysiological responses is warranted to better identify the time window at which circadian rhythms are most receptive to light-induced phase shifting.
30954762<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>The bidirectional impact of sleep and circadian rhythm dysfunction in human ischaemic stroke: A systematic review.<<>>Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption are potentially modifiable risk factors and consequences of ischaemic stroke. Pre-clinical evidence suggests a direct effect of sleep and endogenous circadian rhythm dysfunction on lesion volumes and post-stroke recovery. In humans, sleep and stroke literature has focused primarily on obstructive sleep apnoea. However, the bidirectional impact of non-apnoea related sleep disorders, sleep architecture, and endogenous circadian rhythm dysfunction in ischaemic stroke remains unclear. A systematic search of publications in three major databases from inception to August 7 2018 identified 67 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Long sleep duration or sleep disorders significantly increased the risk of ischaemic stroke. Inversely, ischaemic stroke was associated with sleep architectural and endogenous circadian rhythm disruption which were generally associated with post-stroke severity and functional outcome. Importantly, no studies examined direct measures of circadian rhythm dysfunction as a risk factor for ischaemic stroke. Most studies were moderate to high quality. However, methodology and stroke characteristics (e.g., stroke topography, stroke severity) were heterogenous thereby limiting generalisable conclusions. Furthermore, a priori neuroimaging outcomes in conjunction with sleep and circadian features were seldom assessed. The clinical pathogenic implications and methodological limitations of studies are discussed, and a research agenda for future studies is outlined.
28533170<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Synchronizing effects of melatonin on diurnal and circadian rhythms.<<>>In mammals, the rhythmic secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland is driven by the circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. The robust nightly peak of melatonin secretion is an output signal of the circadian clock and is supposed to deliver the circadian message to the whole of the organism. Since the circadian system regulates many behavioral and physiological processes, its disruption by external (shift-work, jet-lag) or internal desynchronization (blindness, aging) causes many different health problems. Externally applied melatonin is used in humans as a chronobiotic drug to treat desynchronization and circadian disorders, and the success of these treatments does, at first glance, underline the supposed pivotal role of melatonin in the synchronization of the circadian system. On the other hand, pinealectomy in experimental animals and humans does not abolish their rhythms of rest and activity. Furthermore, mice with deficient melatoninergic systems neither display overt defects in their rhythmic behavior nor do they show obvious signs of disease susceptibility, let alone premature mortality. During the last years, our laboratory has investigated several mouse stains with intact or compromised internal melatonin signaling systems in order to better understand the physiological role of the melatoninergic system. These and other investigations which will be reviewed in the present contribution confirm the synchronizing effect of endogenous melatonin and the melatoninergic system. However, these effects are subtle. Thus melatonin does not appear as the master of internal synchronization, but as one component in a cocktail of synchronizing agents.
26467286<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Impairment of Circadian Rhythms in Peripheral Clocks by Constant Light Is Partially Reversed by Scheduled Feeding or Exercise.<<>>In mammals, circadian rhythms in peripheral organs are impaired when animals are maintained in abnormal environmental light-dark cycles such as constant light (LL). This conclusion is based on averaged data from groups of experimental animals sacrificed at each time point. To investigate the effect of LL housing on the peripheral clocks of individual mice, an in vivo imaging system was used to observe the circadian bioluminescence rhythm in peripheral tissues of the liver, kidney, and submandibular salivary gland in PER2::LUCIFERASE knock-in mice. Using this technique, we demonstrated that the majority of individual peripheral tissues still had rhythmic oscillations of their circadian clocks in LL conditions. However, LL housing caused decreased amplitudes and a broad distribution of peak phases in PER2::LUCIFERASE oscillations irrespective of the state of the animals' behavioral rhythmicity. Because both scheduled feeding and scheduled exercise are effective recovery stimuli for circadian clock deficits, we examined whether scheduled feeding or scheduled exercise could reverse this impairment. The results showed that scheduled feeding or exercise could not restore the amplitude of peripheral clocks in LL. On the other hand, the LL-induced broad phase distribution was reversed, and peak phases were entrained to a specific time point by scheduled feeding but only slightly by scheduled exercise. The present results demonstrate that LL housing impairs peripheral circadian clock oscillations by altering both amplitude and phase in individual mice. The broad distribution of clock phases was clearly reversed by scheduled feeding, suggesting the importance of scheduled feeding as an entraining stimulus for impaired peripheral clocks.
30481281<<>>Circadian_Rhythms<<>>Adrenal and Glucocorticoid Effects on the Circadian Rhythm of Murine Intraocular Pressure.<<>>Purpose: Intraocular pressure (IOP) fluctuates with a robust circadian rhythm, which is synchronized to organismal rhythmicity through the master circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei. The mechanisms maintaining circadian synchrony between the suprachiasmatic nuclei and IOP rhythms are presently unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the necessity and sufficiency of adrenal and glucocorticoid function for the entrainment of iris-ciliary body (iris-CB) and IOP circadian rhythms in mice. Methods: Iris-CB complexes were dissected from C57Bl/6J mice that were kept in 12-hour light/dark cycles at 3-hour intervals, and their core clock gene (Per1, Per2, and Bmal1) and glucocorticoid receptor mRNA expression were quantified. Iris-CB complexes from period2::luciferase mice were dissected and cultured to measure in vitro rhythmicity. To determine the phase-shifting effect of glucocorticoids on the iris-CB, dexamethasone or vehicle was added to the cultured tissues at defined circadian phases. The diurnal IOP rhythms of adrenalectomized or sham-operated mice under the 12-hour light/dark cycles were also measured. Results: In iris-CB complexes, glucocorticoid receptor mRNA expression remained stable throughout the day, whereas the mRNA of core clock genes showed a robust circadian rhythmicity. Dexamethasone significantly induced phase-delays when administered between circadian time 8 (CT8) to CT12 and phase-advance when given between CT16 to CT20. Adrenalectomy abolished circadian IOP rhythmicity, particularly diminishing nocturnal IOP elevation compared with sham-operated mice. Conclusions: Glucocorticoids are sufficient for phase shifting the circadian clock in iris-CB. Intact adrenal function is required for manifest circadian rhythms of IOP in mice. Taken together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that glucocorticoids mediate circadian entrainment of IOP to the master circadian oscillator.
20221302<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Associations between Sadness and Anger Regulation Coping, Emotional Expression, and Physical and Relational Aggression among Urban Adolescents.<<>>This study examined associations between self reports of sadness and anger regulation coping, reluctance to express emotion, and physical and relational aggression among two cohorts of predominantly African-American fifth (N = 191; 93 boys and 98 girls) and eighth (N = 167; 73 boys and 94 girls) graders. Multiple regression analyses indicated unique associations between relational aggression and expressive reluctance and sadness regulation coping. In contrast, physical aggression, but not relational aggression, was associated with anger regulation coping. These relations did not differ across gender, but, the strength of the association between anger regulation coping and physical aggression varied by grade. Sadness regulation coping moderated the association between expressive reluctance and relational aggression. Conversely, anger regulation coping moderated the relation between expressive reluctance and physical aggression, however, the strength of this relation differed by gender. These findings have important implications for intervention efforts.
30729634<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Risk predictions of physical aggression in acute psychiatric wards: Findings of a prospective study.<<>>This study was conducted using prospective methods to analyze predictions of the risk of physical aggression from patients with a mental illness and the variables used in these predictions. A total of 252 individuals participated in the study, all of whom were inpatients in acute psychiatric wards. Data were collected using a questionnaire consisting of two questions designed to determine the nature of predictions of the risk of physical aggression from mental health patients at admission and the variables used to make these predictions. Descriptive statistics and chi(2) -tests were used for the data analysis. For approximately two thirds of the patients (61.9%, n = 156), a low-level risk was predicted. The rate of patients predicted to demonstrate physical aggression was significantly higher. Nurses were better able to predict non-aggressive behavior than risks of aggressive behavior. To improve the accuracy of predicting which patients with a mental illness will show aggressive behavior, a risk assessment should be conducted during hospitalization. Using a person-centered approach, administrators in psychiatric settings should adopt an integrative perspective, considering individual and environmental factors, via a multi-disciplinary approach.
28776834<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Overt and Relational Aggression Participant Role Behavior: Measurement and Relations With Sociometric Status and Depression.<<>>This study is the first to measure participant role behavior across overt and relational forms of aggression. The Overt and Relational Aggression Participant Role Behavior Scales were designed to measure aggression, assisting, reinforcing, defending, victimization, and outsider behavior during acts of peer aggression in an ethnically diverse sample of 609 adolescents (M age = 12 years). The data fit the hypothesized 12-factor model, and measurement invariance was established across gender. Relational victimization, but not overt victimization, was positively associated with all other relational aggression roles. Each participant role subscale was positively associated with depressive symptoms with the exception of the overt and relational outsider subscales. Future research and intervention efforts should consider overt and relational aggression participant roles, separately.
30646329<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Risk Factors Associated With Boys' and Girls' Developmental Trajectories of Physical Aggression From Early Childhood Through Early Adolescence.<<>>Importance: This study used multitrajectory modeling to identify distinct trajectories of physical aggression from ages 1.5 to 13 years for boys and girls. Objectives: To trace the development of boys' and girls' physical aggression problems from infancy to adolescence using mother ratings, teacher ratings, and self-ratings and to identify early family predictors of children on the high physical aggression trajectories. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD), a study of a representative, population-based sample of 2223 infants born in 1997 and 1998 in the Canadian province of Quebec. The dates of analysis were January 2017 to January 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Trained research assistants conducted 7 interviews (at child ages 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5, 6, and 8 years) with the person most knowledgeable about the child (mothers in 99.6% [2214 of 2223] of cases). Teachers assessed the child's behavior at ages 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 13 years. Self-reports of behavior problems were obtained from the child at ages 10, 12, and 13 years. Results: The sample included 2223 participants, 51.2% of whom were boys and 91.2% of whom were of white race/ethnicity. The mean response rate for mother ratings of physical aggression during the first 8 years of life was 80.9% (range, 65.1%-91.7%). For teacher ratings of physical aggression from ages 6 to 13 years, the mean response rate was 45.7% (range, 35.4%-56.9%), while the mean response rate of physical aggression assessment from self-ratings between ages 10 and 13 years was 57.9% (range, 55.2%-60.5%). Attrition was higher among families with low socioeconomic status and single-parent families, as well as among young mothers and mothers who were not fluent in French or English. A statistical analysis to examine the consequences of attrition was included. For boys and girls, the frequency of physical aggressions increased from age 1.5 years (2039 [91.7%]) to age 3.5 years (1941 [87.3%]) and then substantially decreased until age 13 years (1228 [55.2%]). Three distinct developmental trajectories of physical aggression were observed for girls and 5 for boys. Most family characteristics measured at 5 months after the child's birth were associated with a high physical aggression trajectory for boys and girls. Conclusions and Relevance: Family characteristics at 5 months after the child's birth could be used to target preschool interventions aimed at preventing the development of boys' and girls' chronic physical aggression problems.
28667677<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Resting heart rate, guilt, and sympathy: A developmental psychophysiological study of physical aggression.<<>>Although low resting heart rate has been linked to frequent aggressive conduct in childhood, little is known about the interaction of this biological risk with social emotions that protect against aggression across development. With a sample of 5-, 8-, and 12-year-olds (N = 110), we tested whether the negative link between resting heart rate and physical aggression was offset by high guilt and sympathy. Caregivers reported their children's physical aggression and sympathy. Children's electrocardiogram data were collected while they viewed a nondescript video, after which they reported their guilt-or lack thereof-in response to vignettes depicting social transgressions. Lower resting heart rate was significantly associated with higher physical aggression in 5-year-olds who reported low-but not medium and high-levels of guilt, and in 8-year-olds with low-but not medium and high-ratings of sympathy. Neither guilt nor sympathy moderated the resting heart rate-physical aggression link in 12-year-olds. We discuss how social emotions may help children with low resting heart rates navigate social conflicts and avoid aggressive physical confrontations.
27893244<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Temporal ordering effects of adolescent depression, relational aggression, and victimization over six waves: Fully latent reciprocal effects models.<<>>The temporal ordering of depression, aggression, and victimization has important implications for theory, policy, and practice. For a representative sample of high school students (Grades 7-10; N = 3,793) who completed the same psychometrically strong, multiitem scales 6 times over a 2-year period, there were reciprocal effects between relational-aggression and relational-victimization factors: aggression led to subsequent victimization and victimization led to subsequent aggression. After controlling for prior depression, aggression, and victimization, depression had a positive effect on subsequent victimization, but victimization had no effect on subsequent depression. Aggression neither affected nor was affected by depression. The results suggest that depression is a selection factor that leads to victimization, but that victimization has little or no effect on subsequent depression beyond what can be explained by the preexisting depression. In support of developmental equilibrium, the results were consistent across the 6 waves. (PsycINFO Database Record
28230907<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Estrogenic suppression of binge-like eating elicited by cyclic food restriction and frustrative-nonreward stress in female rats.<<>>Because binge eating and emotional eating vary through the menstrual cycle in human females, we investigated cyclic changes in binge-like eating in female rats and their control by estrogens. Binge-like eating was elicited by three cycles of 4 days of food restriction and 4 days of free feeding followed by a single frustrative nonreward-stress episode (15 min visual and olfactory exposure to a familiar palatable food) immediately before presentation of the palatable food. Intact rats showed binge-like eating during the diestrous and proestrous phases of the ovarian cycle, but not during the estrous (periovulatory) phase. Ovariectomized (OVX) rats not treated with estradiol (E2) displayed binge-like eating, whereas E2-treated OVX rats did not. The procedure did not increase signs of anxiety in an open-field test. OVX rats not treated with E2 that were subjected to food restriction and sacrificed immediately after frustrative nonreward had increased numbers of cells expressing phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN), and dorsal and ventral bed nuclei of the stria terminalis (BNST) compared with nonrestricted or E2-treated rats. These data suggest that this female rat model is appropriate for mechanistic studies of some aspects of menstrual-cycle effects on emotional and binge eating in human females, that anxiety is not a sufficient cause of binge-like eating, and that the PVN, CeA, and BNST may contribute to information processing underlying binge-like eating.
21046605<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Media depictions of physical and relational aggression: connections with aggression in young adults' romantic relationships.<<>>Various studies have found that viewing physical or relational aggression in the media can impact subsequent engagement in aggressive behavior. However, this has rarely been examined in the context of relationships. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to examine the connection between viewing various types of aggression in the media and perpetration of aggression against a romantic partner. A total of 369 young adults completed a variety of questionnaires asking for their perpetration of various forms of relationship aggression. Participants' exposure to both physical and relational aggression in the media was also assessed. As a whole, we found a relationship between viewing aggression in the media and perpetration of aggression; however, this depended on the sex of the participant and the type of aggression measured. Specifically, exposure to physical violence in the media was related to engagement in physical aggression against their partner only for men. However, exposure to relational aggression in the media was related to romantic relational aggression for both men and women.
28857270<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Physical aggression among patients with dementia, neuropathologically confirmed post-mortem.<<>>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of physical aggression among patients with dementia of different types and to analyze potential differences in clinical traits, in terms of singular or repetitive behavior and occurrence in early or late stage of the disease. We also aimed at examining against whom the physical aggression was exerted. METHODS: We included 281 cases with a neuropathological dementia diagnosis from the brain bank at the Department of Pathology, Lund University, for this retrospective medical records review. The study covers cases with a post-mortem examination performed between 1967 and 2013. RESULTS: Of the 281 patients studied, 97 (35%) patients had a history of exerting physical aggression during the course of their disease. The patients with frontotemporal dementia exerted physical aggression earlier in the course of their disease than Alzheimer's disease patients. The most frequent victims of the patients' physical aggression were health staff and other patients. The aggression also affected family members as well as (to the demented patient) unknown people. The frequency of the physical aggression differed among the different diagnostic groups; frontotemporal dementia patients exhibiting a higher physical aggression frequency score than did Alzheimer's disease patients. CONCLUSIONS: The patterns of manifested physical aggression thus differ between the frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease patient groups in this study. Knowledge about such differences may be of value in decision making in patient care.
30835866<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Direct and indirect relationships among posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, hostility, anger, and verbal and physical aggression in returning veterans.<<>>Hostility, anger, and aggression are conceptually related but unique constructs found to occur more often among veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than among civilians or veterans without PTSD. However, the pathways between PTSD, depression, hostility, anger, and aggression have not been comprehensively characterized. Therefore, drawing on a sample of returning Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom combat veterans ( N = 175; 95% male; mean age 30 years), this study sought to examine the direct and indirect relationships among PTSD, depression, hostility, anger, and four types of aggression: verbal, and physical toward self, others, and objects. Functional modeling of direct effects was done using multiple least-squares regression and bootstrapped mediation analyses were carried out to test indirect effects. Results indicate that PTSD is not the overall direct contributor to different forms of aggression, supporting the mediating role of depression and trait anger. Depression symptoms explain part of the relationships between PTSD and verbal aggression, physical aggression toward objects, and physical aggression toward self and trait anger explains part of the relationships between PTSD and verbal aggression, physical aggression toward objects, and physical aggression toward others. Our findings support the importance of assessing for anger, depression, and different types of aggression among veterans presenting for PTSD treatment to develop individualized treatment plans that may benefit from early incorporation of interventions.
25534757<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Verbal versus physical aggression in Intermittent Explosive Disorder.<<>>Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) is the only adult psychiatric diagnosis for which pathological aggression is primary. DSM-IV criteria focused on physical aggression, but Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) allows for an IED diagnosis in the presence of frequent verbal aggression with or without concurrent physical aggression. It remains unclear how individuals with verbal aggression differ from those with physical aggression with respect to cognitive-affective deficits and psychosocial functioning. The current study compared individuals who met IED criteria with either frequent verbal aggression without physical aggression (IED-V), physical aggression without frequent verbal aggression (IED-P), or both frequent verbal aggression and physical aggression (IED-B) as well as a non-aggressive personality-disordered (PD) comparison group using behavioral and self-report measures of aggression, anger, impulsivity, and affective lability, and psychosocial impairment. Results indicate all IED groups showed increased anger/aggression, psychosocial impairment, and affective lability relative to the PD group. The IED-B group showed greater trait anger, anger dyscontrol, and aggression compared to the IED-V and IED-P groups. Overall, the IED-V and IED-P groups reported comparable deficits and impairment. These results support the inclusion of verbal aggression within the IED criteria and suggest a more severe profile for individuals who engage in both frequent verbal arguments and repeated physical aggression.
23606625<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>A cross-lagged structural equation model of relational aggression, physical aggression, and peer status in a Chinese culture.<<>>This short-term longitudinal study examined the associations among relational aggression, physical aggression, and peer status (i.e., acceptance, rejection, and perceived popularity) across three time points, six months apart, in a Taiwanese sample. Participants were 198 fifth grade students (94 girls and 104 boys; Mean age = 10.35 years) from Taipei, Taiwan. Study variables were assessed using peer nomination procedure. Results from the cross-lagged structural equation models demonstrated that there were longitudinal associations between relational aggression and each of the peer status constructs while only one longitudinal association was found for physical aggression such that physical aggression positively predicted subsequent peer rejection. The longitudinal associations did not vary with gender. Results also showed high stabilities of relational aggression, physical aggression, and the three peer status constructs over 1 year as well as high concurrent association between relational and physical aggression. In addition, relational aggression and physical aggression were concurrently related to less acceptance, more rejection, and less perceived popularity, especially at the outset of the study. Findings of this study demonstrated both similarities and differences in relation to previous literature in primarily Western cultures. This study also highlights the bidirectional and complex nature of the association between aggression and peer status, which appears to depend on the form of aggression and on the particular indicator of peer status under study.
29806562<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Cardiac Autonomic Function and Psychological Characteristics of Heterosexual Female Perpetrators of Intimate Partner Physical Aggression.<<>>Intimate partner violence is predominantly viewed as a social problem of men's violence against women. However, a growing evidence base suggests an equal prevalence rate for male and female perpetrated intimate partner physical aggression. Moreover, female perpetrated intimate partner violence is often assumed to be reactive, yet there is limited evidence to support this notion. In this article, we describe the results of two studies that investigated the prevalence of female perpetrated intimate partner physical aggression, and its correlates in heterosexual female university students. The relationships of personality traits, resting heart rate, and heart rate variability (a correlate of vagal activity) were compared between females who did and did not report having engaged in intimate partner physical aggression. In Study 1, we found that 30.9% of participants reported enacting intimate partner physical aggression during the preceding 12 months. This finding suggests that a considerable number of undergraduate females aggress against their intimate partners. Perpetrators, relative to nonperpetrators, scored higher on secondary psychopathic traits. In Study 2, female intimate partner violence was shown to be associated with low resting heart rate and high heart rate variability. Perpetrators, relative to nonperpetrators, scored higher on psychopathic traits that index emotional resilience and unempathic tendencies, and reported increased proactive and reactive aggression. This raises the possibility that some incidences of female intimate partner physical aggression represent proactive aggressive acts. These findings also support the frequently found association between low resting heart rate and aggression, but raise the prospect that the reported aggressive acts reflect high heart rate variability and strong parasympathetic nervous system activity.
29035692<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Developmental Origins of Chronic Physical Aggression: A Bio-Psycho-Social Model for the Next Generation of Preventive Interventions.<<>>This review describes a bio-psycho-social approach to understanding and preventing the development of chronic physical aggression. The debate on the developmental origins of aggression has historically opposed genetic and environmental mechanisms. Recent studies have shown that the frequency of physical aggression peaks in early childhood and then decreases until old age. Molecular genetic studies and twin studies have confirmed important genetic influences. However, recent epigenetic studies have highlighted the important role of environments in gene expression and brain development. These studies suggest that interrelated bio-psycho-social channels involved in the development of chronic physical aggression are generally the product of an intergenerational transmission process occurring through assortative mating, genetic inheritance, and the inheritance of physical and social environmental conditions that handicap brain functioning and support the use of physical aggression to solve problems. Given these intergenerational mechanisms and physical aggression onset in infancy, it appears clear that preventive interventions should start early in pregnancy, at the latest.
26503759<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Does Gender Moderate the Relationship between Callous-Unemotional Traits and Physical Aggression?<<>>The study investigates the interaction effect of callous-unemotional (CU) traits and gender on physical aggression among Nigerian adolescents. Two hundred and ninety five (295) senior secondary school students who were between 14-16 years of age participated in the study. These participants included boys (152) and girls (143). They were selected from a public senior secondary school in Anambra a South Eastern State of Nigeria and all the participants were of Igbo ethnic group. The raw data for Callous-unemotional traits and Physical Aggression were collected using Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU) by Frick (2004) and Aggression Scale by Orpinas and Frankowski (2001) respectively. The data were analyzed using Pearson correlation, and conditional process analysis (model number 1; Hayes, 2013). The results showed that gender correlated significantly with uncaring and physical aggression but did not correlate significantly with CU and callousness. The results further showed that gender, CU traits, uncaring and callousness subscales significantly predicted physical aggression. Gender also moderated the effect of CU traits and uncaring on physical aggression, but did not moderate the effect of callousness on physical aggression. The discussion focused on the ways of helping individuals with high level of CU traits to reduce aggression, also the limitations of the study, suggestions for further studies and the implications of the finding were highlighted.
24750046<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>The family context of relational aggression in "difficult to treat" female juvenile offenders.<<>>Female juvenile offenders often engage in socially aggressive behaviors that make them more difficult to treat than male juvenile offenders. This social (i.e., relational) aggression may be developed or maintained through transactions with family members. To investigate this issue, we measured relational aggression in the family interactions of 140 adolescents divided by gender and offender status into four equal-sized groups (female juvenile offenders, male juvenile offenders, female nonoffenders, and male nonoffenders). Adolescents and caregivers completed a family discussion task, and raters coded relationally aggressive behaviors at the dyadic level. Results showed that female juvenile offenders and their mothers directed more relational aggression toward each other than did mother-adolescent dyads in the other groups. Implications of these results for treatment and research are discussed.
28393381<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Peer victimization and changes in physical and relational aggression: The moderating role of executive functioning abilities.<<>>This study is the first to examine whether executive functioning (EF) abilities moderate longitudinal associations between peer victimization and engagement in physically and relationally aggressive behavior. Participants were 61 children (9-13 years, M = 10.68, SD = 1.28; 48% male) drawn from a partially clinical sample who were assessed at two time points, approximately 12 months apart. At time 1, children were administered a battery of EF tests; adult reports of children's relational and physical victimization and use of relational and physical aggression were collected. At time 2, adult-reported aggression was re-collected. Regression analyses tested whether EF ability moderated the association between peer victimization and increased engagement in aggression. Form-specific (e.g., physical victimization predicting physical aggression) and cross-form (e.g., physical victimization predicting relational aggression) models were tested. EF moderated the association between physical victimization and increases in physical aggression over time and between relational victimization and increases in relational aggression over time. Physical victimization predicted increases in physical aggression only among children with poor EF. However, relational victimization predicted increases in relational aggression for children with good EF skills but decreases in relational aggression for children with poor EF skills. Interaction effects for cross-form models were not significant. Results suggest that there are distinct risk factors implicated in children's engagement in physical and relational aggression. Established cognitive vulnerability models for engagement in physical aggression should not be assumed to apply to engagement in relational aggression.
25047301<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Predicting borderline personality disorder symptoms in adolescents from childhood physical and relational aggression, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.<<>>Developmental cascade models linking childhood physical and relational aggression with symptoms of depression and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; assessed at ages 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14) to borderline personality disorder (BPD) features (assessed at age 14) were examined in a community sample of 484 youth. Results indicated that, when controlling for within-time covariance and across-time stability in the examination of cross-lagged relations among study variables, BPD features at age 14 were predicted by childhood relational aggression and symptoms of depression for boys, and physical and relational aggression, symptoms of depression, and symptoms of ADHD for girls. Moreover, for boys BPD features were predicted from age 10 ADHD through age 12 depression, whereas for girls the pathway to elevated BPD features at age 14 was from depression at age 10 through physical aggression symptoms at age 12. Controlling for earlier associations among variables, we found that for girls the strongest predictor of BPD features at age 14 was physical aggression, whereas for boys all the risk indicators shared a similar predictive impact. This study adds to the growing literature showing that physical and relational aggression ought to be considered when examining early precursors of BPD features.
26132685<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Targeting relational aggression in veterans: the Strength at Home Friends and Family intervention.<<>>OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effectiveness of Strength at Home Friends and Families (SAH-F), a dyadic group intervention to prevent relational aggression and its negative consequences, in a community-based sample of service members/veterans and significant others who reported relational difficulties. METHOD: Participants included 70 veterans and their loved ones. Recruitment was conducted from October 2010 through March 2012. Participants completed an initial assessment that included measures of relational aggression and functioning, depressive symptoms, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Participants were enrolled in the 10-week SAH-F targeting social information-processing mechanisms hypothesized to underlie the relationship between trauma and aggression and were reassessed at program completion and 3 months after intervention. RESULTS: Significant reductions in psychological aggression were seen both at program completion and at 3-month follow-up for both veterans (standardized mean gain effect size [ESsg] = -0.45, P < .05) and significant others (ESsg = -0.30, P < .05). Perpetration of physical aggression remained low after pretreatment and did not increase. Relationship adjustment reported by significant others, but not veterans, indicated a significant improvement from pretreatment to program completion (ESsg = 0.33, P < .05). Significant (P < .05) decreases in depressive symptoms were observed from pretreatment to program completion for veterans (ESsg = -0.30, P < .05) and significant others (ESsg = -0.55, P < .05), and significant decreases in PTSD symptoms were observed from pretreatment to follow-up for veterans and significant others (ESsg = -0.52, P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Results provide support for the effectiveness of SAH-F in reducing relational aggression in military member/significant other dyads and enhancing relationship quality and mental health.
21274855<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Media violence, physical aggression, and relational aggression in school age children: a short-term longitudinal study.<<>>Many studies have shown that media violence has an effect on children's subsequent aggression. This study expands upon previous research in three directions: (1) by examining several subtypes of aggression (verbal, relational, and physical), (2) by measuring media violence exposure (MVE) across three types of media, and (3) by measuring MVE and aggressive/prosocial behaviors at two points in time during the school year. In this study, 430 3rd-5th grade children, their peers, and their teachers were surveyed. Children's consumption of media violence early in the school year predicted higher verbally aggressive behavior, higher relationally aggressive behavior, higher physically aggressive behavior, and less prosocial behavior later in the school year. Additionally, these effects were mediated by hostile attribution bias. The findings are interpreted within the theoretical framework of the General Aggression Model.
24454423<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Prevalence and Associated Factors of Physical, Verbal and Relational Aggression among Iranian Preschoolers.<<>>OBJECTIVE: Childhood aggression may lead to severe social disorders in adolescence and adulthood. Different psychiatric approaches are focused on preschool aged aggressive children. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and associated factors of childhood direct and indirect aggression. METHODS: In this cross sectional study a total of 1403 children attending 43 kindergartens were assessed. Data were collected through a structured 46-item questionnaire investigating symptoms of physical, verbal and relational aggression which was completed by parents and teachers of day-care centers. Complex sample survey analysis and multivariate logistic regression method were used for data analysis. RESULTS: According to parents' rating, the prevalence of physical,verbal and relational aggression, was 9.9% (95% CI=7.4%-12.4%), 6.3% (95% CI=5.0% -7.6%) and 1.6% (95%CI=1.0%-2.2%), respectively; while based on teachers' rating the prevalence of physical,verbal and relational aggression were 10.9% (95% CI=8.9% -12.9%), 4.9%(95% CI=3.8% -6.0%) and 6% (95% CI=4.4% -7.6%), respectively. A wide range of family environment factors including living with a single parent, having a working mother, death of someone close to the child, and having less educated mother were significantly associated with different types of aggression; additionally, there was some evidence of a relationship between sex of the children and physical aggression, after controlling for other variables (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study revealed that children's family environment alongside internal factors plays an important role as an external factor in determining the child's potential aggressive behavior. Given this, to better prevent the aggressive behavior of children, intervention strategies should be planned for families and caregivers; specially mothers should receive training to use such strategies.
24252744<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Parents who hit and scream: interactive effects of verbal and severe physical aggression on clinic-referred adolescents' adjustment.<<>>The goals of this study were first, to delineate the co-occurrence of parental severe physical aggression and verbal aggression toward clinic-referred adolescents, and second, to examine the interactive effects of parental severe physical aggression and verbal aggression on adolescent externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. This research involved 239 referrals of 11- to 18-year-old youth and their dual-parent families to a non-profit, private community mental health center in a semi-rural Midwest community. Multiple informants (i.e., adolescents and mothers) were used to assess parental aggression and adolescent behavior problems. More than half of clinic-referred adolescents (51%) experienced severe physical aggression and/or high verbal aggression from one or both parents. A pattern of interactive effects of mother-to-adolescent severe physical aggression and verbal aggression on adolescent behavior problems emerged, indicating that when severe physical aggression was present, mother-to-adolescent verbal aggression was positively associated with greater adolescent behavior problems whereas when severe physical aggression was not present, the links between verbal aggression and behavior problems was no longer significant. No interactive effects were found for father-to-adolescent severe physical aggression and verbal aggression on adolescent adjustment; however, higher father-to-adolescent verbal aggression was consistently linked to behavior problems above and beyond the influence of severe physical aggression. The results of this study should promote the practice of routinely assessing clinic-referred adolescents and their parents about their experiences of verbal aggression in addition to severe physical aggression and other forms of abuse.
26801482<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Bullying, Physical Aggression, Gender-Atypicality, and Sexual Orientation in Samoan Males.<<>>Bullying is characterized by the repeated attempts of a group or individual to gain social advantage by the use of relational, verbal, or physical aggression against a target, especially when there is a perceived or actual power imbalance (Espelage & Swearer, 2003). One consistent finding is that gay (i.e., androphilic) males report higher rates of victimization due to bullying in adolescence than their heterosexual (i.e., gynephilic) counterparts. Western data indicate that gender-atypical behavior, regardless of sexual orientation, is a key predictor of victimization due to bullying. Androphilic males generally display childhood gender-atypicality, including reduced levels of physical aggression, which may cause bullies to perceive them as "easy" targets. In order to test the associations between sexual orientation, childhood gender-atypicality, and recalled victimization due to bullying, a sample of Samoan gynephilic men (n = 100) were compared to a group of Samoan transgender androphilic males (n = 103), known as fa'afafine. Although the fa'afafine reported far more childhood gender-atypicality, the two groups did not differ significantly on measures of physical aggression or their reported rates of victimization due to bullying. Additionally, greater physical aggression, not gender-atypicality, was the only significant predictor of being bullied in both men and fa'afafine. These results suggest that there is nothing inherent in sexual orientation or childhood gender-atypicality that would potentiate victimization from bullying. Instead, the cultural context in which a bully functions influences the extent to which these are "acceptable" reasons to target certain individuals.
16741683<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>A longitudinal study of relational aggression, physical aggression, and children's social-psychological adjustment.<<>>Although great strides have recently been made in our understanding of relational aggression and its consequences, one significant limitation has been the lack of prospective studies. The present research addressed this issue by identifying and assessing groups of relationally aggressive, physically aggressive, relationally plus physically aggressive (co-morbid), and nonaggressive children during their third grade year in elementary school and then reassessing them a year later, during fourth-grade (N = 224, 113 girls). Two aspects of social-psychological adjustment were assessed during both assessment periods including internalizing difficulties (i.e., withdrawal, depression/anxiety, and somatic complaints) and externalizing problems (i.e., aggressive behavior, delinquency). It was revealed that the strongest predictor of future social-psychological adjustment problems and increases in these problems from third to fourth was the combination of relational and physical aggression. Relational aggression also contributed unique information, relative to physical aggression, in the prediction of future maladjustment. Implications of these findings for future research and prevention efforts, particularly for aggressive girls, are discussed.
30281153<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Sex differences in adolescent physical aggression: Evidence from sixty-three low-and middle-income countries.<<>>A great deal of research shows that adolescent and adult males are more likely to engage in physical aggression and violence than females are. However, few studies have examined cross-cultural variation in sex differences, particularly among low- and middle-income countries [LMICs]. Based on social role and sexual selection theories, we derived two hypotheses regarding possible variations in sex differences across societal contexts: 1) sex differences increase with societal gender polarization (social role theory) and 2) sex differences are exacerbated in societies where socio-economic opportunities are scarce, unequal, or insecure (prediction derived from sexual selection theory). The current study examined the prevalence of and variation in sex differences in physical aggression, as measured by frequent fighting, among 247,909 adolescents in 63 low- and middle-income countries. The results show that, overall, males were over twice as likely (OR = 2.68; 95% CI = 2.60-2.76) to report frequent fighting in the past 12 months than females. However, sex differences vary significantly across LMICs, wherein countries with higher female prevalence rates have smaller sex differences in frequent fighting. Contrary to expectations derived from social role theory, sex differences in physical aggression decrease as societal gender inequality increased. In regards to sexual selection theory, we find no evidence that sex differences in frequent fighting varies according to societal rule of law or income inequality.
28943676<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Bidirectional Pathways between Relational Aggression and Temperament from Late Childhood to Adolescence.<<>>Relational aggression is linked to numerous adverse consequences. However, we know little about how temperament leads individuals to become perpetrators/victims of relational aggression, or how being a perpetrator/victim influences the development of temperament. We used longitudinal data from 674 Mexican-origin youth to examine relations between relational aggression and mother- and child-reported temperament from 5(th) grade (Mage=10.8; SD=0.60) through 11(th) grade (Mage=16.8; SD=0.50). Results show that: (a) high Negative Emotionality and low Effortful Control predicted increases in victimization; (b) low Effortful Control predicted increases in perpetration; (c) victims increased in Negative Emotionality and decreased in Effortful Control; and (d) perpetrators increased in Negative Emotionality and Surgency. Thus, temperament serves as both an antecedent to and a consequence of relational aggression.
30664416<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>A psychosocial analysis of relational aggression in Mexican adolescents based on sex and age.<<>>BACKGROUND: This paper aims to identify predictive variables of relational aggression related to the individual, family and school environment in Mexican adolescents according to sex and age. METHOD: A total of 8,115 Mexican adolescents (51.5% boys), aged 11 to 16 years old (M = 13.34 years, SD = 1.040), selected by proportional stratified sampling. RESULTS: From a stepwise regression analysis it was observed that the main predictors of relational aggression were non-conformist self-perception of social reputation, psychological distress, attitude toward institutional authority and offensive communication with the mother. CONCLUSIONS: Relational aggression underlies important explanatory dimensions for the prevention of school aggression, such as social reputation and psychological distress, which have been little explored in this field of study.
22081237<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Gender differences in predicting antisocial behaviors: developmental consequences of physical and relational aggression.<<>>This study investigated gender differences in the relationship of early physical and relational aggression to later peer rejection and overt and covert antisocial behaviors. Significant gender differences were found indicating physically aggressive boys were more likely than girls to experience later peer rejection. Early physical aggression was related to later overt antisocial behavior for boys and girls, and more strongly for girls than for boys. Early relational aggression was not associated with later forms of antisocial behavior. In the context of early physical aggression, for boys and girls peer rejection generally served to increment risk for later overt and covert antisocial behavior in an additive fashion. The data suggest some gender specificity in the social risk processes associated with the development of early overt and covert antisocial behaviors.
30183479<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Borderline Personality Features Mediate the Association Between ADHD, ODD, and Relational and Physical Aggression in Girls.<<>>OBJECTIVE: This study investigates borderline personality features (BPF) as a mediator of the association between ADHD and ODD symptoms and aggression in girls. METHOD: Parents of 118 girls ( Mage = 11.40 years old) with and without ADHD completed ratings of ADHD and ODD severity, and parents and youth provided ratings of physical and relational aggression. RESULTS: ADHD, ODD, and their subfactors were significantly correlated with BPF, and these variables were associated with aggression measures. BPF fully mediated the association between total ODD symptom severity and relational and physical aggression by parent and youth report. At the subfactor level, BPF fully mediated the association between hyperactivity/impulsivity and oppositional behavior and physical and relational aggression. CONCLUSION: These findings add to a growing literature showing the relevance of BPF as a risk factor for poor social functioning in youth and point to the importance of continued work examining BPF among girls with ADHD and ODD.
29670316<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Friendship Selection and Influence Processes for Physical Aggression and Prosociality: Differences between Single-Sex and Mixed-Sex Contexts.<<>>The present study examined to what extent selection and influence processes for physical aggression and prosociality in friendship networks differed between sex-specific contexts (i.e., all-male, all-female, and mixed-sex classrooms), while controlling for perceived popularity. Whereas selection processes reflect how behaviors shape friendships, influence processes reveal the reversed pattern by indicating how friends affect individual behaviors. Data were derived from a longitudinal sample of early adolescents from Chile. Four all-male classrooms (n = 150 male adolescents), four all-female classrooms (n = 190 female adolescents), and eight mixed-sex classrooms (n = 272 students) were followed one year from grades 5 to 6 (Mage = 13). Analyses were conducted by means of stochastic-actor-based modeling as implemented in RSIENA. Although it was expected that selection and influence effects for physical aggression and prosociality would vary by context, these effects showed remarkably similar trends across all-male, all-female, and mixed-sex classrooms, with physical aggression reducing and with prosociality increasing the number of nominations received as best friend in all-male and particularly all-female classrooms. Further, perceived popularity increased the number of friendship nominations received in all contexts. Influence processes were only found for perceived popularity, but not for physical aggression and prosociality in any of the three contexts. Together, these findings highlight the importance of both behaviors for friendship selection independent of sex-specific contexts, attenuating the implications of these gendered behaviors for peer relations.
22331575<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>"Frenemies, Fraitors, and Mean-em-aitors": Priming Effects of Viewing Physical and Relational Aggression in the Media on Women.<<>>Past research has shown activation of aggressive cognitions in memory after media violence exposure, but has not examined priming effects of viewing relational aggression in the media. In the current study, 250 women viewed a video clip depicting physical aggression, relational aggression, or no aggression. Subsequent activation of physical and relational aggression cognitions was measured using an emotional Stroop task. Results indicated priming of relational aggression cognitions after viewing the relationally aggressive video clip, and activation of both physical and relational aggression cognitions after viewing the physically aggressive video clip. Results are discussed within the framework of the General Aggression Model.
30411855<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>DRD4 methylation as a potential biomarker for physical aggression: An epigenome-wide, cross-tissue investigation.<<>>Epigenetic processes that regulate gene expression, such as DNA methylation (DNAm), have been linked to individual differences in physical aggression. Yet, it is currently unclear whether: (a) DNAm patterns in humans associate with physical aggression independently of other co-occurring psychiatric and behavioral symptoms; (b) whether these patterns are observable across multiple tissues; and (c) whether they may function as a causal versus noncausal biomarker of physical aggression. Here, we used a multisample, cross-tissue design to address these questions. First, we examined genome-wide DNAm patterns (buccal swabs; Illumina 450k) associated with engagement in physical fights in a sample of high-risk youth (n = 119; age = 16-24 years; 53% female). We identified one differentially methylated region in DRD4, which survived genome-wide correction, associated with physical aggression above and beyond co-occurring symptomatology (e.g., ADHD, substance use), and showed strong cross-tissue concordance with both blood and brain. Second, we found that DNAm sites within this region were also differentially methylated in an independent sample of young adults, between individuals with a history of chronic-high versus low physical aggression (peripheral T cells; ages 26-28). Finally, we ran a Mendelian randomization analysis using GWAS data from the EAGLE consortium to test for a causal association of DRD4 methylation with physical aggression. Only one genetic instrument was eligible for the analysis, and results provided no evidence for a causal association. Overall, our findings lend support for peripheral DRD4 methylation as a potential biomarker of physically aggressive behavior, with no evidence yet of a causal relationship.
25047286<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Physiological stress reactivity and physical and relational aggression: the moderating roles of victimization, type of stressor, and child gender.<<>>The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the association between physiological reactivity to peer stressors and physical and relational aggression. Potential moderation by actual experiences of peer maltreatment (i.e., physical and relational victimization) and gender were also explored. One hundred ninety-six children (M = 10.11 years, SD = 0.64) participated in a laboratory stress protocol during which their systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and skin conductance reactivity to recounting a relational stressor (e.g., threats to relationships) and an instrumental stressor (e.g., threats to physical well-being, dominance, or property) were assessed. Teachers provided reports of aggression and victimization. In both boys and girls, physical aggression was associated with blunted physiological reactivity to relational stress and heightened physiological reactivity to instrumental stress, particularly among youth higher in victimization. In girls, relational aggression was most robustly associated with blunted physiological reactivity to relational stressors, particularly among girls exhibiting higher levels of relational victimization. In boys, relational aggression was associated with heightened physiological reactivity to both types of stressors at higher levels of peer victimization and blunted physiological reactivity to both types of stressors at lower levels of victimization. Results underscore the shared and distinct emotional processes underlying physical and relational aggression in boys and girls.
20924815<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Resident-to-resident relational aggression and subjective well-being in assisted living facilities.<<>>PURPOSE: Research in settings similar to assisted living facilities suggests that relational aggression, an indirect and mature form of aggression, might occur in assisted living facilities. This empirical study investigates the existence of relational aggression in a sample of residents and the relationship between relational aggression and resident's subjective well-being. DESIGN AND METHODS: 121 residents from six assisted living facilities completed questionnaires assessing personal experiences as victims of relational aggression and subjective well-being. Also nurses reported on victimization of relational aggression for every participant. Linear regression models were used to examine the association between both reports of relational aggression and subjective well-being. RESULTS: Relational aggression was shown to exist in assisted living facilities according to both residents (prevalence: 19%) and nurses (prevalence: 41%). Chi-square testing revealed no association between ratings by nurses and residents. Self-reports of victimization of relational aggression were related to depression, anxiety, satisfaction with life and social loneliness, but not to emotional loneliness. Nurse-reports of victimization of relational aggression were not related to subjective well-being. IMPLICATIONS: Self-reports of relational aggression seem to be better predictors of resident's well-being than nurse-reports of relational aggression. Awareness of these findings and the discrepancy between nurse-reports and self-reports are important for practice and for future research regarding social dynamics and living arrangements in elderly care settings.
29195517<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Organized Activity Participation and Relational Aggression: The Role of Positive Youth Development.<<>>Relational aggression among early adolescents is a pervasive problem that negatively influences the health and well-being of youth. Strength-based approaches such as positive youth development (PYD) are a promising way to reduce risk of detrimental outcomes such as relational aggression. Participation in organized activities is a key way that youth build assets related to PYD. Yet, few researchers have examined empirically assets related to PYD as a mechanism by which organized activity participation may help reduce risk of relational aggression. In this study, we used structural equation modeling to investigate if assets associated with PYD mediate the relationship between organized activity participation and relational aggression using survey data from a diverse, school-based sample of early adolescents (N = 196; mean age = 12.39 years; SD = 0.52; 60% female; 45% African American, 27% White, 21% multiracial, and 7% other, 71% economically disadvantaged). We tested 2 competing models, 1 with decomposed PYD factors and 1 with an integrated PYD factor. Our results suggest that PYD better fit as an integrated versus decomposed construct, providing support for the notion that youth benefit most from assets related to PYD when they operate collectively. Our results also provide support for PYD-related factors as a mechanism by which participation may reduce risk of relational aggression. Limitations of this study, and implications for prevention are discussed.
28440068<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Correlates of verbal and physical aggression among patrons of licensed venues in Australia.<<>>INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: The current study aimed to examine the association between patron demographics and substance use, and experiences of verbal and physical aggressive incidents within the last 3 months among patrons of night-time entertainment precincts (NEP) in Australia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Patron interviews (n = 4216) were conducted around licensed venues in the NEPs of five Australian cities. Seven correlates of verbal and physical aggressive incidents were examined: gender, age, occupation, blood alcohol concentration, pre-drinking, energy drink use and illicit drug use in the current session. RESULTS: A total of 7.5% and 8.2% of respondents reported involvement in a verbally and physically aggressive incident in the past 3 months, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression models indicated men and people <25 years old were significantly more likely to report both verbal and physical aggressive incidents. A significant occupation effect showed lower levels of both verbal and physical aggression in managers/professionals compared with non-office workers. The likelihood of being involved in a verbally aggressive incident significantly increased with energy drink consumption, while the likelihood of being involved in a physically aggressive incident significantly increased with blood alcohol concentration, energy drink consumption and illicit drug use. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the different correlates of verbal and physical aggression within NEPs, suggesting they should be viewed as distinct types of violence, rather than points on a continuum. Major modifiable correlates with verbal and physical aggression included intoxication, energy drink consumption, and illicit drug use, suggesting the need for further interventions and policy development to address these key issues.

28868757<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Depression in early adolescence: Contributions from relational aggression and variation in the oxytocin receptor gene.<<>>Interpersonal stress arising from relational aggression (RA)-the intentional effort to harm others via rejection and exclusion-may increase risk for depression in youth. Biological vulnerabilities related to the hormone oxytocin, which affects social behavior and stress responses, may exacerbate this risk. In a community sample of 307 youth (52% female; age range = 10-14 years), we tested whether (1) the association between RA and subsequent depressive symptoms was mediated through social problems and (2) a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs53576) in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) moderated this indirect association between RA and depression, where GG homozygotes are predicted to be more sensitive to the effects of social problems than A-allele carriers. Youth-reported RA and depressive symptoms were measured using a structured interview and a questionnaire, respectively. DNA was extracted from saliva collected with Oragene kits. Consistent with the interpersonal theory of depression, the association between relational aggression and subsequent depressive symptoms was mediated by social problems. This indirect effect was further moderated by rs53576 genotype, such that GG homozygotes showed a stronger mediation effect than A-carriers. These results suggest that rs53576 variants confer vulnerability for depression within the context of interpersonal risk factors, such that youth with the GG genotype may be particularly sensitive to the social consequences resulting from RA.
23504600<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>The role of social networks in physical and relational aggression among young adolescents.<<>>Despite the veritable influence of the peer context on the elaboration of adolescent aggression, few studies of relational aggression have directly identified and measured peer groups, limiting our ability to draw formal conclusions about the level and nature of peer influence. The current study used a developmental framework to examine peer group influence on individual levels of physical and relational aggression over a year with 6th and 7th grade students (n = 346, 51 % female). A multilevel network approach was used in which peer groups were identified via social network analysis, and peer group influence was evaluated with hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). HLM analyses indicated that peer group aggression (physical and relational) at time 1 was predictive of individual aggression levels at time 2 after controlling for other peer group characteristics as well as other individual risk and protective factors. Although both forms of aggression were embedded in peer networks, findings suggest that physical aggression is relatively less endemic to peer networks, and is more likely to occur in smaller, predominantly male networks. The current study highlights the importance of understanding the influence of peer group membership on adolescent aggression and points to important implications for prevention.
27002969<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Keeping Quiet Just Wouldn't be Right: Children's and Adolescents' Evaluations of Challenges to Peer Relational and Physical Aggression.<<>>Youth peer groups hold many different types of norms, including norms supporting aggressive behavior. Challenging or standing up to such aggressive norms can be difficult for children and adolescents, given the pressures to conform to groups. In the current study, the relationship between individual judgments and expectations of the judgments of a peer group about the acceptability of challenging aggressive group norms was investigated. The sample included 9-10 and 13-14 year-olds (N = 292, 52.4 % female). Participants evaluated groups with norms condoning physical and relational aggression. Participants were more supportive of challenges to relational aggression than challenges to physical aggression. Additionally, age-related differences were found, with younger children perceiving challenges to group norms as more feasible than did adolescents. Participants individually rated challenging aggressive norms as okay, but thought that groups would be much less supportive of such challenges. The results also documented the influence of gender stereotypes about aggressive behavior on children's and adolescents' evaluations.
26762376<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Skin Conductance Level Reactivity Moderates the Association Between Parental Psychological Control and Relational Aggression in Emerging Adulthood.<<>>When studying factors that may heighten risk for relational aggression in youth, it is important to consider characteristics of both the individual and their environment. This research examined the associations between parental psychological control and reactive and proactive relational aggression in emerging adults in college. Given that sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation may underlie differences between reactive and proactive aggression and has been shown to moderate the effects of parenting on youth development, the moderating role of SNS reactivity [indexed by skin conductance level reactivity (SCLR)] was also examined. Emerging adults (N = 180; 77.2 % female) self-reported on perceptions of parental psychological control and reactive and proactive relational aggression. SCLR was assessed in response to an interpersonal laboratory challenge task. Parental psychological control was positively associated with reactive relational aggression only for emerging adults who exhibited high SCLR. Parental psychological control was positively associated with proactive relational aggression only among emerging adults who showed low SCLR. This study extends previous research on parenting and aggression and suggests that parental psychological control is differentially associated with reactive versus proactive relational aggression, depending on emerging adults' SCLR to interpersonal stress.
20573107<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Individual and peer group normative beliefs about relational aggression.<<>>Studies show that children who use relational aggression process social information in unique ways; however, findings have been inconsistent and limited by methodological weaknesses. This short-term longitudinal study examined developmental changes in 245 (49% female; ages 8-13) 3rd through 8th graders' normative beliefs about relational aggression and tested the hypothesis that individual and classroom-level norms predict relational aggression 1 year later. Results showed that the transition to middle school was marked by increased approval of relational aggression, and individual norms predicted future relational aggression. Importantly, a contextual model showed that students in peer groups highly supportive of relational aggression became increasingly aggressive. Findings extend social information processing theories of relational aggression to focus on the role of peer group cognitions.
21883301<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Backbiting and bloodshed in books: short-term effects of reading physical and relational aggression in literature.<<>>The current research consisted of two studies examining the effects of reading physical and relational aggression in literature. In both studies, participants read one of two stories (containing physical or relational aggression), and then participated in one of two tasks to measure aggression. In Study 1, participants who read the physical aggression story were subsequently more physically aggressive than those who read the relational aggression story. Conversely, in Study 2, participants who read the relational aggression story were subsequently more relationally aggressive than those who read the physical aggression story. Combined, these results show evidence for specific effects of reading aggressive content in literature.
20148303<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Relational aggression and hostile attribution biases: testing multiple statistical methods and models.<<>>The present study used both categorical and dimensional approaches to test the association between relational and physical aggression and hostile intent attributions for both relational and instrumental provocation situations using the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development longitudinal Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (M = 8.3 years-old, SD = 0.19, N = 840). A one standard deviation threshold was used to create categorical aggression status groups. In categorical analyses, children who were both relationally and physically aggressive were found to attribute more hostile intent attributions in relationally provocative situations. Results from the dimensional analyses indicated that female gender, physical aggression, and hostile attribution biases for instrumental provocations each predicted increases in relational aggression over time. Further, relational aggression was not predictive of hostile attribution biases for relational provocations, and instead physical aggression was predictive. Implications for the fields of developmental psychology and psychopathology are discussed.
27655342<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Executive Functioning and Engagement in Physical and Relational Aggression among Children with ADHD.<<>>Although evidence suggests that executive functioning (EF) impairments are implicated in physically aggressive behavior (e.g., hitting) these cognitive impairments have rarely been examined with regard to relational aggression (e.g., gossip, systematic exclusion). Studies also have not examined if EF impairments underlie the expression of aggression in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and if child gender moderates risk. Children with and without clinical elevations in ADHD symptoms (N = 124; ages 8-12 years; 48 % male) completed a battery of EF tests. Parent and teacher report of ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms and teacher report of engagement in physical and relational aggression were collected. Models tested the unique association of EF abilities with physical and relational aggression and the indirect effect through the expression of ADHD or ODD behaviors; child gender was also tested as a moderator. EF impairment was uniquely associated with physical aggression, but better EF ability was associated with relational aggression. For boys, poor EF also was indirectly associated with greater physical aggression through the expression of ADHD behaviors. However, ADHD symptoms were unrelated to relational aggression. ODD symptoms also predicted physical aggression for boys but relational aggression for girls. Results suggest that there are multiple and distinct factors associated with engagement in physical and relational aggression and that better EF may actually promote relational aggression. Established models of physical aggression should not be assumed to map on to explanations of relational aggression.
30945885<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Developmental trajectories of physical aggression and prosocial behavior in early childhood: Family antecedents and psychological correlates.<<>>Research has documented various family and individual risk factors associated with severe conduct problems, but little is known about the developmental origins of children who engage in both aggressive and prosocial interactions with others. The present study utilized growth-mixture modeling to identify distinct trajectories of physical aggression and prosocial behavior across the preschool years in a large (n = 424), diverse (42% immigrant) Canadian sample. Parent ratings of aggression and prosocial behavior were assessed at ages 3, 4.5, and 6 years. Observed mother-child interactions and mother-reported child exposure to interparental conflict were measured at 1.5 and 3 years. Children's psychological functioning (language ability, academic achievement, theory of mind understanding) was assessed at ages 3 and 4.5. Four trajectory classes emerged. Most children (74%) showed low/moderate-declining aggression and high/moderate-increasing prosocial behavior (prosocial and desisting classes), whereas a minority (7%) were highly aggressive and relatively low in prosocial behavior (chronic aggressive class). The remaining 19% of children exhibited low-increasing aggression and moderate-stable prosocial behavior (escalating class). Increased exposure to interparental conflict between 1.5 and 3 years uniquely predicted membership in the escalating compared with the prosocial group, whereas prosocial and escalating children did not differ in positive parent-child interactions in toddlerhood. Children in the escalating class demonstrated typical psychological functioning relative to prosocial children, and both outperformed chronically aggressive youth. These findings highlight the need to move beyond a singular deficit-model to consider alternative pathways by which socially skilled children may develop aggressive tendencies.

21701908<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Associations between relational aggression, depression, and suicidal ideation in a child psychiatric inpatient sample.<<>>The current study examined relations between relational aggression, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation in a child clinical population. Participants included 276 children (M(age) = 9.55 years; 69% Male) who were admitted to a child psychiatric inpatient facility. Findings suggested that relational aggression was associated with depressive symptoms, which in turn was associated with suicidal ideation. The test of indirect effects suggested that depressive symptoms fully accounted for the link between relational aggression and suicidal ideation. Moreover, these relations were found when also controlling for the variance associated with overt aggression, history of abuse, and social problems. Current findings appear to suggest that relational aggression is linked to depressive symptoms, which is linked to suicidal ideation within a clinical population, and as such there may be clinical utility in assessing relational aggression.
23386551<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Is relational aggression part of the externalizing spectrum? a bifactor model of youth antisocial behavior.<<>>The primary purpose of the present study was to examine support for the inclusion of relational aggression (RAgg) alongside physical aggression (Agg) and rule-breaking behaviors (RB) as a subfactor of antisocial behavior (ASB). Caregiver reports were collected for 1,087 youth (48.9% male) ages 6-18. Results indicated that all three subfactors of ASB demonstrated substantial loadings on a general ASB factor. Using a bifactor model approach, specific factors representing each ASB subfactor were simultaneously modeled, allowing for examination of common and specific correlates. At the scale level, results demonstrated consistently strong connections with high Neuroticism and low Agreeableness across all 3 ASB subfactors, a pattern which was replicated for the general ASB factor in the bifactor approach. Specific factors in the bifactor model demonstrated connections with personality and psychopathology correlates, primarily for Agg. These findings provide some support for an overall grouping of RAgg with other ASB subfactors in youth, and further distinguish Agg as potentially representing a more potent variant of youth ASB relative to both RB and RAgg.
27586070<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>The socializing effect of classroom aggression on the development of aggression and social rejection: A two-wave multilevel analysis.<<>>The current study examined the moderating effect of classroom aggression on the development of individual aggression and on the path from individual aggression to social rejection over time. The study included 1,284 elementary school children and consisted of two data waves 10months apart. At both time points, teachers assessed the children's physical and relational aggression and their social rejection status. Multi-level analyses revealed that the classroom level of relational aggression moderated the link between individual relational aggression at T1 and T2 (b=-0.18, 95% CI [-0.32, -0.05], p<.01) and the link between T1 relational aggression and T2 social rejection (b=-0.12, 95% CI [-0.23, -0.003], p<.01). Being in a classroom where relational aggression was prevalent increased relational aggression among children with a low level of relational aggression at T1. Furthermore, a high individual level of relational aggression predicted greater social rejection in classrooms with a low level of relational aggression. Children were mainly influenced by their same-gender peers. Boys as a group had a greater influence than girls on their peers of either gender in the domain of relational aggression, whereas girls as a group had a greater influence in the domain of physical aggression. The contributions of analyzing cross-level interaction to understanding the developmental patterns of aggression and social rejection in middle childhood are discussed.
26168263<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Physical aggression, compromised social support, and 10-year marital outcomes: Testing a relational spillover model.<<>>The purpose of the present study was to test a relational spillover model of physical aggression whereby physical aggression affects marital outcomes due to its effects on how spouses ask for and provide support to one another. Newlywed couples (n = 172) reported levels of physical aggression over the past year and engaged in interactions designed to elicit social support; marital adjustment, and stability were assessed periodically over the first 10 years of marriage. Multilevel modeling revealed that negative support behavior mediated the relationship between physical aggression and 10-year marital adjustment levels whereas positive support behavior mediated the relationship between physical aggression and divorce status. These findings emphasize the need to look beyond conflict when explaining how aggression affects relationships and when working with couples with a history of physical aggression who are seeking to improve their relationships.
18506684<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Relational aggression and victimization in gay male relationships: the role of internalized homophobia.<<>>This article presents two studies that are the first to examine relational aggression and relational victimization in gay male peer relationships. A qualitative pilot study provides a strong rationale for a subsequent empirical investigation of 100 young adult, self-identified gay males. Results of both studies demonstrate that relational aggression and relational victimization are common experiences in gay male relationships. They also reveal forms of relational aggression and victimization that appear to be unique to gay males (e.g., outing). Results of the empirical study found significant relations between engaging in relational aggression against gay males and experiencing relational victimization and between experiencing relational victimization and internalized homophobia. However, there was no significant correlation between internalized homophobia and engaging in relational aggression. A multiple regression analysis found that experiencing relational victimization was correlated more strongly with the combination of engaging in relational aggression and internalized homophobia together than with relational aggression alone. Results are discussed within the framework of Allport's "traits due to victimization" theory and Meyer's theory of "minority stress." Implications for the prevention of relational aggression/victimization in gay male relationships are offered.
25441652<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Media violence exposure and physical aggression in fifth-grade children.<<>>OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of media violence exposure and physical aggression in fifth graders across 3 media types. METHODS: We analyzed data from a population-based, cross-sectional survey of 5,147 fifth graders and their parents in 3 US metropolitan areas. We used multivariable linear regression and report partial correlation coefficients to examine associations between children's exposure to violence in television/film, video games, and music (reported time spent consuming media and reported frequency of violent content: physical fighting, hurting, shooting, or killing) and the Problem Behavior Frequency Scale. RESULTS: Child-reported media violence exposure was associated with physical aggression after multivariable adjustment for sociodemographics, family and community violence, and child mental health symptoms (partial correlation coefficients: TV, 0.17; video games, 0.15; music, 0.14). This association was significant and independent for television, video games, and music violence exposure in a model including all 3 media types (partial correlation coefficients: TV, 0.11; video games, 0.09; music, 0.09). There was a significant positive interaction between media time and media violence for video games and music but not for television. Effect sizes for the association of media violence exposure and physical aggression were greater in magnitude than for most of the other examined variables. CONCLUSIONS: The association between physical aggression and media violence exposure is robust and persistent; the strength of this association of media violence may be at least as important as that of other factors with physical aggression in children, such as neighborhood violence, home violence, child mental health, and male gender.
18837593<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Using a vulnerability-stress-adaptation framework to predict physical aggression trajectories in newlywed marriage.<<>>The authors used a vulnerability-stress-adaptation framework to examine personality traits and chronic stress as predictors of the developmental course of physical aggression in the early years of marriage. Additionally, personality traits and physical aggression were examined as predictors of the developmental course of chronic stress. Data from 103 couples collected 4 times over the first 3 years of marriage were analyzed with an actor-partner interdependence model and structural equation modeling techniques. Personality traits of husbands predicted their own physical aggression and stress trajectories, as well as their wives' levels of stress and physical aggression. Personality traits of wives predicted their levels of stress and physical aggression and predicted changes in their physical aggression over time. Both husbands' and wives' changes in stress predicted changes in physical aggression over time. Implications for employment of a vulnerability-stress-adaptation model in the study of physical aggression and for improvement of the efficacy of therapies targeting physical aggression in intimate relationships are delineated.
25037891<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Adolescents' aggression to parents: longitudinal links with parents' physical aggression.<<>>PURPOSE: To investigate whether parents' previous physical aggression (PPA) exhibited during early adolescence is associated with adolescents' subsequent parent-directed aggression even beyond parents' concurrent physical aggression (CPA) and to investigate whether adolescents' emotion dysregulation and attitudes condoning child-to-parent aggression moderate associations. METHODS: Adolescents (N = 93) and their parents participated in a prospective longitudinal study. Adolescents and parents reported at waves 1-3 on four types of parents' PPA (mother to adolescent, father to adolescent, mother to father, and father to mother). Wave 3 assessments also included adolescents' emotion dysregulation, attitudes condoning aggression, and externalizing behaviors. At waves 4 and 5, adolescents and parents reported on adolescents' parent-directed physical aggression, property damage, and verbal aggression and on parents' CPA. RESULTS: Parents' PPA emerged as a significant indicator of adolescents' parent-directed physical aggression (odds ratio [OR]: 1.25, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0-1.55; p = .047), property damage (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.1-1.5, p = .002), and verbal aggression (OR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.15-1.6, p < .001) even controlling for adolescents' sex, externalizing behaviors, and family income. When controlling for parents' CPA, previous mother-to-adolescent aggression still predicted adolescents' parent-directed physical aggression (OR: 5.56, 95% CI: 1.82-17.0, p = .003), and father-to-mother aggression predicted adolescents' parent-directed verbal aggression (OR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.0-3.3, p = .036). Emotion dysregulation and attitudes condoning aggression did not produce direct or moderated the effects. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents' parent-directed aggression deserves greater attention in discourse about lasting, adverse effects of even minor forms of parents' physical aggression. Future research should investigate parent-directed aggression as an early signal of aggression into adulthood.
29551877<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>The Role of Placement History and Current Family Environment in Children's Aggression in Foster Care.<<>>Predictors of the physical and relational aggressive behavior of children in foster care were examined (N = 160, 50.9% male, M age = 7.57, SD = 2.39). First, predictors representative of children's placement histories were examined in relation to the children's aggression at T1. Next, predictors representing characteristics of the current family environment were examined in relation to the children's aggression at T2 (four months later). Results revealed that a greater number of prior group home placements and being in a non-kinship home were associated with higher physical aggression at T1. A greater number of prior group home placements, a fewer number of regular home placements, being in a non-kinship home, and prior removal from the home due to neglect were associated with higher relational aggression at T1. The results also revealed that higher foster sibling relational aggression at T1 predicted lower child physical aggression at T2. If foster siblings were biological children of the foster parent, higher levels of a foster sibling's physical aggression at T1 predicted reduced child physical aggression at T2. The opposite pattern was observed if foster siblings were not biological children of the foster parent. Lastly, longer time in the current placement, more children in the home, and the presence of a sibling that was a biological child of the parent predicted higher child relational aggression at T2. These findings provide initial insights into how placement history and current family environment are associated with the physical and relational aggressive behavior of children in foster care.
21815200<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Relational Aggression in Women during Emerging Adulthood: A Social Process Model.<<>>Two studies investigated potential mediators of the association between relational victimization and relational aggression. Self-report measures of aggressive behavior among peers, exclusivity, hostile attribution biases, and borderline personality disorder (BPD) symptoms were collected. In study 1, participants were 180 female emerging adults (M = 18.82, SD = 1.18). Both exclusivity and hostile attribution biases for relational provocations were found to partially mediate the association between relational victimization and relational aggression. In study 2, participants were 54 female emerging adults (M = 19.16, SD = 1.11). Symptoms of BPD were not found to mediate the association between relational victimization and relational aggression, yet unique associations with relational aggression were observed. The results add to recent research guided by a social process model in which links between victimization and aggression are more clearly understood.
20624807<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Pubertal stage and the prevalence of violence and social/relational aggression.<<>>OBJECTIVE: We examined associations between pubertal stage and violent adolescent behavior and social/relational aggression. METHODS: The International Youth Development Study comprises statewide representative student samples in grades 5, 7, and 9 (N = 5769) in Washington State and Victoria, Australia, drawn as a 2-stage cluster sample in each state. We used a school-administered, self-report student survey to measure previous-year violent behavior (ie, attacking or beating up another person) and social/relational aggression (excluding peers from the group, threatening to spread lies or rumors), as well as risk and protective factors and pubertal development. Cross-sectional data were analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with early puberty, the odds of violent behavior were approximately threefold higher in midpuberty (odds ratio [OR]: 2.87 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.81-4.55]) and late puberty (OR: 3.79 [95% CI: 2.25-6.39]) after adjustment for demographic factors. For social/relational aggression, there were weaker overall associations after adjustment, but these associations included an interaction between pubertal stage and age, and stronger associations with pubertal stage at younger age were shown (P = .003; midpuberty OR: 1.78 [95% CI: 1.20-2.63]; late puberty OR: 3.00 [95% CI: 1.95-4.63]). Associations between pubertal stage and violent behavior and social/relational aggression remained after the inclusion of social contextual mediators in the analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Pubertal stage was associated with higher rates of violent behavior and social/relational aggression, with the latter association seen only at younger ages. Puberty is an important phase at which to implement prevention programs to reduce adolescent violent and antisocial behaviors.
28441915<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Early-life adversity-induced long-term epigenetic programming associated with early onset of chronic physical aggression: Studies in humans and animals.<<>>Objectives: To examine whether chronic physical aggression (CPA) in adulthood can be epigenetically programmed early in life due to exposure to early-life adversity. Methods: Literature search of public databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus. Results: Children/adolescents susceptible for CPA and exposed to early-life abuse fail to efficiently cope with stress that in turn results in the development of CPA later in life. This phenomenon was observed in humans and animal models of aggression. The susceptibility to aggression is a complex trait that is regulated by the interaction between environmental and genetic factors. Epigenetic mechanisms mediate this interaction. Subjects exposed to stress early in life exhibited long-term epigenetic programming that can influence their behaviour in adulthood. This programming affects expression of many genes not only in the brain but also in other systems such as neuroendocrine and immune. Conclusions: The propensity to adult CPA behaviour in subjects experienced to early-life adversity is mediated by epigenetic programming that involves long-term systemic epigenetic alterations in a whole genome.
30892534<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>[Characterization of oral maxillofacial lesions resulting from physical aggression: differences between genders].<<>>In developed countries, violence is the main cause of oral maxillofacial (OMF) injuries. In Brazil, there are scant records of such lesions. The scope of this study was to detail the OMF injuries resulting from physical aggression in a capital of the Brazilian northeast and analyze gender differences. The Forensic Medicine Institute of Sao Luis, state of Maranhao, featured 15,847 reports, which occurred in 2012, and they were investigated. Socioeconomic, demographic data and OMF characteristics were analyzed. The Chi-square and Fisher's Exact tests were applied to assess gender differences. Of the cases examined, 1977 were OMF. Female victims, aged 20-59, dark-skinned, without a partner and maids were the most affected. Ecchymosis-type lesions, in the mouth and lip regions arising from the use of blunt instruments, causing permanent functional impairment, were the most prevalent in women (P < 0.05), whereas dental fracture and contusion arising from sharp instruments causing permanent deformity, occupational disability, and threat to life were detected in men (P < 0.05). The conclusion drawn is that the incidence of OMF due to physical aggression is high in Sao Luis, state of Maranhao, and although women are the most affected, the OMF in men are more severe.
20012555<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Effects of alcohol on trajectories of physical aggression among urban youth: an application of latent trajectory modeling.<<>>Several studies have investigated factors associated with physical aggression during adolescence. Yet, little is known about the longitudinal relationship between drug use, particularly alcohol use, and physical aggression among minority youth. The present study examined the effects of alcohol and substance use at age 11 on trajectories of physical aggression over time (ages 12-14) among urban adolescents from Chicago, IL. Data from the Project Northland Chicago (n = 3038, 49.4% female) was used. The current study sample included 1,160 Black, 1,015 Hispanic and 863 White/other adolescents for a total of 3,038 adolescents. Four trajectories of physical aggression were identified: Non-aggressive (16%), Desistors (9%), Escalators (20%) and Chronic Aggressive (55%). After adjusting for physical aggression behaviors, delinquent friends, lack of supervised time, demographic variables, smoking and marijuana use, past year alcohol users at age 11 were 2.1 times more likely to be "Escalators" and 1.9 times more likely to be in the "Chronic Aggressive" group. Gender and ethnic differences were also observed in the trajectories of physical aggression. Black youth were 2.5 times more likely to be in the "Chronic Aggressive" group. Findings highlight the importance of targeting alcohol prevention to reduce physical aggression among urban young adolescents.
30930800<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Empathy at the Heart of Darkness: Empathy Deficits That Bind the Dark Triad and Those That Mediate Indirect Relational Aggression.<<>>The dark triad (DT) traits-psychopathy, narcissism and Machiavellianism-have collectively been linked to reduced empathy and increased aggression; however, their association with distinct empathic subtypes remains unclear; and unique links to indirect relational aggression (IRA) have not been delineated. Moreover, whether dark traits should be conceptualized individually, as a dyad or as a triad with a dark core centered around the absence of empathy is debated. The current study examines (i) whether impaired empathy indeed represents a common "dark core" binding Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy, and (ii) this core explains associations between the dark traits and IRA. Participants (N = 301, 262 F/39 M) completed measures of the DT traits, cognitive and affective empathy components and IRA (Social Exclusion, Malicious Humor and Guilt Induction). The individual traits model without links between narcissism and IRA showed the best fit, suggesting that, at least in the context of IRA, the DT traits are best viewed as three independent personality traits. Distinct cognitive and affective empathy deficits and capacities are seen in the DT. Peripheral responsivity was the only type of empathy deficit associated with all dark traits, but unrelated to IRA. Psychopathy was the strongest indicator of impaired empathy and all IRAs; however, only online simulation, an affect-related cognitive empathy facet, partially mediated the relationships of psychopathy and Machiavellianism with IRA. Whilst the unique pathways for the dark triad traits suggest stronger alignment of psychopathy and Machiavellianism in their empathic deficits and indirect aggression; the data do not support the notion that an unempathic dark core underpinning all three traits drives indirect aggression. This is the first paper delineating the specific empathic deficits involved using a facet approach and their link to indirect forms of aggression. Results therefore inform theoretical models of aggression in the DT and offer some clarity on the debates surrounding the unempathic dark core in the DT.
24410717<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>The impact of victimization and witnessing violence on physical aggression among high-risk adolescents.<<>>Relations among witnessing violence, victimization, and physical aggression were investigated within a high-risk sample of 1,156 sixth graders. Longitudinal, multilevel analyses were conducted on two waves of data from two cohorts of students in 37 schools from four communities. The sample was 65% male and 67% African American. Neighborhood concentrated disadvantage, witnessing violence, victimization, and physical aggression were strongly and positively correlated at the school level. Contrary to hypothesis, exposure to violence did not mediate the effects of neighborhood concentrated disadvantage on changes in physical aggression. As expected, witnessing violence and physical aggression had bidirectional longitudinal effects on each other at the student level. In contrast, there were no cross-variable relations between changes in violent victimization and aggression over time.
29797798<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Developmental Trajectories of Chinese Adolescents' Relational Aggression: Associations With Changes in Social-Psychological Adjustment.<<>>This study investigated the development of relational aggression (RA) in a sample of Chinese youth (N = 2,274, 52% boys) from fourth (Mage = 10.27 years) to ninth grade. Using latent class growth analysis, four trajectories were identified for both peer- and teacher-rated RA: a no aggression trajectory, a low-increasing trajectory, a moderate-decreasing trajectory, and a chronically high trajectory. Chronically high RA showed a chronicity effect on adolescent peer acceptance, rejection, and rule-breaking behaviors. Adolescents showed worse adjustment as RA increased, but they did not necessarily evidence significant improvement in adjustment even if their RA decreased. Findings reveal the maladaptive nature of RA and highlight the importance of considering cultural context in understanding RA.
23262830<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Race and ethnicity, substance use, and physical aggression among U.S. high school students.<<>>Youth violence is a critical public health problem across races/ethnicities in the United States. Although the differential association between substance use and physical aggression has been empirically proven, no tests have assessed the moderating effects of sociocultural differences in such associations. The purpose of this study is to test the moderating impact of race/ethnicity-as an indicator of sociocultural differences--on the associations between substance use and adolescent aggression, by conducting a validity assessment of a physical aggression measure for high school students with emphasis on Hispanics and other minorities. A cross-sectional, secondary data analysis of the 2007 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey, with a representative sample of all U.S. high school students, was conducted. Contingency table and chi-square test evaluated the statistical relationship between substance use (alcohol, marijuana, either, or both) and self-reports of physical aggression, race/ethnicity, age, and sex of the respondent. Three logistic regression analyses assessed the effect of race/ethnicity on the likelihood of reporting physical aggression by overall substance use and type of substance use. Statistical significant associations were found between physical aggression and alcohol and/or marijuana use. The self-report of substance use (marijuana or alcohol) and alcohol use significantly increased the likelihood of physical aggression across races/ethnicities, highest among racial/ethnic minorities (Blacks > Hispanic > Others > Whites). The differential impact of substance use on physical aggression was confirmed, and such impact was moderated by the sociocultural context (race/ethnicity) of the adolescent. In-depth validity assessments are needed to confirm this study's predictive validity findings.
24850766<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Heterogeneity of relationally aggressive adolescents in Taiwan: direct and indirect relational aggression.<<>>Relational aggressors mistreat their targets in covert ways; however, they also inflict psychological harm to victims. A clarification of the distinctive function of the perpetrators' destructive patterns would be helpful for interventional consideration. This study's purpose was to, first, explore the classification of relational aggression (RA) by means of operational channels, and then, to examine the psychosocial characteristics of each subtype. The participants were 860 junior high school students (431 boys, M age = 14.2) from four schools in Taiwan. Self-reported measures of empathy, normative beliefs of RA, and coping strategy of interpersonal conflicts were used for data collection, as well as peer-nominated measures of RA and peer acceptance. By means of cluster analyses, five clusters were identified: direct, indirect, severe/combined, mild/combined, and uninvolved. The meaningfulness of the resultant cluster solution was examined through the analysis of social-cognitive, affective, and behavioral features as well as psychosocial adjustment. The findings indicated that different subgroups of relational aggressors demonstrated distinct psychosocial characteristics. In particular, in contrast to non-involved adolescents, the direct group tended to regard RA as acceptable, and the indirect group was more likely to rely on social support and have negative emotional reactions in dealing with interpersonal problems.
30949882<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Relational Aggression in Adolescents with Conduct Disorder: Sex Differences and Behavioral Correlates.<<>>As most research on conduct disorder (CD) has been conducted on male participants, it has been suggested that female-specific symptoms may be underestimated based on current DSM-5 criteria. In particular, relational aggression, i.e. the hurtful, often indirect, manipulation of relationships with the intention of damaging the other's social position, has been proposed as a characteristic of CD that is more common in females. In addition, sex-specific studies on correlates of relational aggressive behavior are lacking. Relational aggression may be strongly related to the correlates of proactive aggression, namely low affective empathy, and high levels of callous-unemotional (CU) traits and relational victimization. Thus, the present study investigated sex differences in relational aggression, and associations between relational aggression and correlates of proactive aggression in 662 adolescents with CD (403 females) and 849 typically-developing controls (568 females) aged 9-18 years (M = 14.74, SD = 2.34) from the European multi-site FemNAT-CD study. Females with CD showed significantly higher levels of relational aggression compared to males with CD, whereas no sex differences were seen in controls. Relational aggression was only partly related to correlates of proactive aggression in CD: Independent of sex, CU traits showed a positive association with relational aggression. In females only, cognitive, but not affective empathy, was negatively associated with relational aggression. Relational victimization was more strongly associated with relational aggression in males compared to females. Despite interesting sex specific correlates of relational aggression, effects are small and the potential clinical implications should be investigated in future studies.
28095002<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>The personality context of relational aggression: A Five-Factor Model profile analysis.<<>>Relational aggression (RAgg) is a form of behavior intended to damage the victim's social status or interpersonal relationships through the use of purposeful interpersonal manipulation or social exclusion (Archer & Coyne, 2005). RAgg is impairing, stable, and largely defined by dysfunctional patterns of interpersonal interactions-all of which invokes comparisons to personality and, more specifically, personality pathology. Leveraging research using the Five Factor Model (FFM) in personality disorder (PD) work, the present study aims to understand the personality context of RAgg by applying this FFM profile approach in 2 ways: (a) by compiling a personality profile of RAgg based on a thorough review of the relevant literature and (b) by compiling a personality profile of RAgg based on expert ratings (N = 19). We then compared these profiles to each other and to existing personality profiles of Cluster B PDs to examine how RAgg fits into the personality space represented by Cluster B PDs. These analyses indicate that both FFM profiles of RAgg show substantial overlap with the FFM profile of narcissistic PD. The present study has important implications for bridging disjointed domains of research on personality pathology and RAgg and underscores the relevance of RAgg for early emergence of PD characteristics.

18540799<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Trait correlates of relational aggression in a nonclinical sample: DSM-IV personality disorders and psychopathy.<<>>The implications of adult relational aggression in adults for personality pathology are poorly understood. We investigated the association between relational aggression and features of DSM-IV personality disorders and psychopathy in a sample of undergraduates (N = 220). In contrast to the childhood literature, we found no significant difference in relational aggression between men and women. Unlike overt aggression, which correlated about equally highly with features of all three personality disorder clusters, relational aggression correlated significantly more highly with features of Cluster B than Clusters A or C. In addition, even after controlling for overt aggression, relational aggression correlated significantly with features of psychopathy, although only with Factor 2 traits. With the exception of sadistic personality disorder features, gender did not moderate the relationship between relational aggression and personality pathology. Further research on the psycho-pathological implications of relational aggression in more severely affected samples is warranted.
26891018<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Social and physical aggression trajectories from childhood through late adolescence: Predictors of psychosocial maladjustment at age 18.<<>>This research examined whether following social and physical aggression trajectories across Grades 3-12 predicted psychological maladjustment. Teachers rated participants' (n = 287, 138 boys) aggressive behavior at the end of each school year. Following the 12th grade, psychosocial outcomes were measured: rule-breaking behaviors, internalizing symptoms, and narcissistic and borderline personality features. Following the highest social aggression trajectory predicted rule-breaking behavior; the medium social aggression trajectory was not a significant predictor of any outcome. Following the highest physical aggression trajectory predicted rule-breaking, internalizing symptoms, and narcissism, whereas the medium physical aggression trajectory predicted rule-breaking and internalizing symptoms.
30560404<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>The Influence of Friendships on Aggressive Behavior in Early Childhood: Examining the Interdependence of Aggression.<<>>The present short-term longitudinal study examined the stability and role of peer influence on both physical and relational aggression in early childhood using a dyadic data analytic framework. Following the peer-individual interaction model, forms of aggressive behavior (i.e., physical and relational) were observed in 43 dyads of close friendships in early childhood (M = 47.37 months, SD = 7.56) to better understand how friendships may maintain aggressive behavior over time. Friendship quality (FQ) was included as a moderator to explain how friendships may maintain aggression. The results provide evidence supporting the affiliation hypothesis for physical aggression with opposite findings for relational aggression. Negative FQ moderated associations with both relational and physical aggression over time whereas positive FQ moderated the dyadic influence with physical aggression over time. Limitations and future directions are discussed.
19903269<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Relational aggression and adverse psychosocial and physical health symptoms among urban adolescents.<<>>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine relational aggression and its relationship with adverse psychosocial and physical health symptoms among urban, African American youth. DESIGN AND SAMPLE: Quantitative, cross-sectional survey design. The sample consisted of 185 predominantly African American (95.1%) seventh-grade students (mean age: 13.0; female: 58%) attending 4 urban middle schools. MEASURES: The Children's Social Behavior Scale and Social Experience Questionnaire were used to measure relational aggression and relational victimization. The Pediatric Symptom Checklist was used to assess psychosocial difficulties, including internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, and attention problems. Physical health symptoms were measured with questions about colds/flu, headaches, and stomach aches. RESULTS: 2-way multivariate analysis of variance revealed significant differences in externalizing behavior, with perpetrators reporting higher levels than nonperpetrators. Victims reported more internalizing behavior than nonvictims; however, this was only significant for males. For females, significant negative effects on health outcomes were found, resulting from the interaction of perpetration and victimization. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that relational aggression is a common occurrence among urban, minority adolescents and may result in adverse health outcomes. These results provide several avenues for future research and implications for healthcare practice. Intervention strategies are needed to prevent relational aggression and continual or subsequent adverse health symptoms.
24684716<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Friendship conflict and the development of generalized physical aggression in the early school years: a genetically informed study of potential moderators.<<>>Several authors consider high and frequent conflicts between friends during childhood as a serious risk for subsequent conduct problems such as generalized physical aggression toward others (e.g., Kupersmidt, Burchinal, & Patterson, 1995; Sebanc, 2003). Although it seems logical to assume that friendship conflict could have some negative consequences on children's behaviors, some scholars have suggested that a certain amount of conflict between friends may actually promote social adjustment (e.g., Laursen & Pursell, 2009). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of friendship conflict in regard to the development of generalized physical aggression toward others in the early school years (i.e., from kindergarten to Grade 1), as well as the moderating role of relational (i.e., shared positive affect and dyadic conflict resolution skills) and personal (i.e., children's sex and genetic liability for aggression) characteristics in this context. The sample included 745 twins assessed through teacher, peer, child, and friend ratings in kindergarten and Grade 1. Friendship conflict in kindergarten was linearly related to an increase in boys' but not girls' generalized physical aggression. However, shared positive affect and conflict resolution skills mitigated the prospective associations between friendship conflict and generalized physical aggression. These results were independent of children's sex, genetic risk for physical aggression, and initial levels of generalized physical aggression in kindergarten. Fostering a positive relationship between friends at school entry may buffer against the risk associated with experiencing friendship conflict.
29435947<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Characteristics of Physical Aggression in Children of Immigrant Mothers and Non-immigrant Mothers: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of the Survey of Young Canadians.<<>>Physical aggression (PA) is important to regulate as early as the preschool years in order to ensure healthy development of children. This study aims to determine the prevalence and characteristics of PA in children of immigrant and non-immigrant mothers. Secondary data analysis was conducted using the nationwide 2010 Survey for Young Canadians, limited to children 4-9 years of age. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression was performed, with the outcome, PA, and covariates including maternal, child, household and neighbourhood characteristics. Twenty percent of children of non-immigrant mothers and 16% of children of immigrant mothers reported PA. The only common characteristic of PA between children of non-immigrant (Adj OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.09-1.89) and immigrant mothers (Adj OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.07-4.03) was viewing violent movies/shows. The characteristics of PA differ between children of immigrant versus non-immigrant mothers therefore healthcare providers, policy makers, and researchers should be mindful to address PA in these two groups separately, and find ways to tailor current recommended coping strategies and teach children alternative ways to solve problems based on their needs.
18605842<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Neuroendocrine regulation and physical and relational aggression: the moderating roles of child maltreatment and gender.<<>>The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the association between circadian rhythms of cortisol and physical and relational aggression. Morning arrival, prelunch, and afternoon predeparture salivary cortisol were assessed among 418 maltreated and nonmaltreated children (52% maltreated; 49% female) attending a summer day camp. Counselors and peers rated participants' involvement in physically and relationally aggressive behaviors. Results indicated that physical aggression was associated with heightened cortisol following morning arrival and relatively steep declines in cortisol over the day, whereas relational aggression was associated with low cortisol following morning arrival and blunted diurnal change in cortisol. Moreover, maltreatment was a significant moderator of this relationship such that aggression was related to greater cortisol dysregulation among nonmaltreated than among maltreated children. The findings suggest that physiological correlates of aggression may differ for physical and relational forms of aggression and among maltreated versus nonmaltreated populations.
28402839<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Borderline personality disorder symptoms and criminal justice system involvement: The roles of emotion-driven difficulties controlling impulsive behaviors and physical Aggression.<<>>OBJECTIVE: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is associated with elevated risk for a variety of risky behaviors, including criminal behaviors. Yet, limited research has examined the relation of BPD to criminal justice (CJ) involvement, or the mechanisms underlying this relation. PROCEDURES: This study examined the role of two mechanisms, emotion-driven difficulties controlling impulsive behaviors and physical aggression, in the relation between BPD symptom severity and CJ involvement among 118 patients in residential substance abuse treatment (76% male; 62% African-American). Participants completed measures of BPD symptom severity, CJ contact, diversity of CJ charges, emotion-driven impulse control difficulties, physical aggression, and covariates (substance use severity and antisocial personality disorder symptoms). RESULTS: BPD symptom severity was associated with CJ contact through emotion-driven difficulties controlling impulsive behaviors, and with diversity of CJ charges through emotion-driven difficulties controlling impulsive behaviors and physical aggression; however, the indirect relations to diversity of CJ charges became non-significant when covariates were included. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the important role of emotion-driven difficulties controlling impulsive behaviors in criminal behaviors among individuals with BPD symptoms, as well as the potential clinical utility of targeting this mechanism to prevent CJ involvement and/or recidivism.
19130362<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Relations between parental psychological control and childhood relational aggression: reciprocal in nature?<<>>Using a cross-lagged panel design, this study examined the directionality of relations between parental psychological control and child relational aggression. Data were collected from a proportionally stratified sample of 600 Flemish 8- to 10-year-old children at 3 measurement points with 1-year intervals. Reciprocal effects were evident in mother-child dyads. Maternal psychological control was positively related to child relational aggression 1 year later, and child relational aggression was positively related to maternal psychological control 1 year later. The father-child dyads were best represented by unidirectional parent effects. Paternal psychological control was positively related to child relational aggression 1 year later. Surprisingly, these effects emerged only for relational aggression as indexed by mother and father reports and not for relational aggression as indexed by teacher and peer measures.
23922720<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Childhood chronic physical aggression associates with adult cytokine levels in plasma.<<>>BACKGROUND: An increasing number of animal and human studies are indicating that inflammation is associated with behavioral disorders including aggression. This study investigates the association between chronic physical aggression during childhood and plasma cytokine levels in early adulthood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Two longitudinal studies were used to select males on a chronic physical aggression trajectory from childhood to adolescence (n = 7) and a control group from the same background (n = 25). Physical aggression was assessed yearly by teachers from childhood to adolescence and plasma levels of 10 inflammatory cytokines were assessed at age 26 and 28 years. Compared to the control group, males on a chronic physical aggression trajectory from childhood to adolescence had consistently lower plasma levels of five cytokines: lower pro-inflammatory interleukins IL-1alpha (T(28.7) = 3.48, P = 0.002) and IL-6 (T(26.9) = 3.76, P = 0.001), lower anti-inflammatory interleukin IL-4 (T(27.1) = 4.91, P = 0.00004) and IL-10 (T(29.8) = 2.84, P = 0.008) and lower chemokine IL-8 (T(26) = 3.69, P = 0.001). The plasma levels of four cytokines accurately predicted aggressive and control group membership for all subjects. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Physical aggression of boys during childhood is a strong predictor of reduced plasma levels of cytokines in early adulthood. The causal and physiological relations underlying this association should be further investigated since animal data suggest that some cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1beta play a causal role in aggression.
21686034<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>The Preventing Relational Aggression in Schools Everyday Program: A Preliminary Evaluation of Acceptability and Impact.<<>>Despite recent research suggesting that relationally aggressive behaviors occur frequently and may lead to physically aggressive actions within urban school settings, there has been little prior research to develop and evaluate relational aggression prevention efforts within the urban schools. The current article describes the development and preliminary evaluation of the Preventing Relational Aggression in Schools Everyday (PRAISE) Program. PRAISE is a 20-session classroom-based universal prevention program, designed to be appropriate and responsive to the needs of youth within the urban school context. Results suggest strong acceptability for the program and feasibility of implementation. Further, the program was especially beneficial for girls. For instance, girls in classrooms randomly assigned to the PRAISE Program demonstrated higher levels of knowledge for social information processing and anger management techniques and lower levels of relational aggression following treatment as compared to similar girls randomly assigned to a no-treatment control condition. Further, relationally aggressive girls exhibited similar benefits from the program (greater knowledge and lower levels of relational aggression) plus lower levels of overt aggression following treatment as compared to relationally aggressive girls within the control classrooms. In contrast, the program was not associated with improvements for boys across most measures. The significance and implications of the findings for research and practice are discussed.
20698028<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Relational aggression in marriage.<<>>Drawing from developmental theories of relational aggression, this article reports on a study designed to identify if spouses use relationally aggressive tactics when dealing with conflict in their marriage and the association of these behaviors with marital outcomes. Using a sample of 336 married couples (672 spouses), results revealed that the majority of couples reported that relationally aggressive behaviors, such as social sabotage and love withdrawal, were a part of their marital dynamics, at least to some degree. Gender comparisons of partner reports of their spouse's behavior revealed that wives were significantly more likely to be relationally aggressive than husbands. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that relational aggression is associated with lower levels of marital quality and greater marital instability for both husbands and wives. Implications are drawn for the use of relational aggression theory in the future study of couple conflict and marital aggression.
25431522<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Family Violence and Children's Behavior Problems: Independent Contributions of Intimate Partner and Child-Directed Physical Aggression.<<>>Using data from a diverse sample of 581 families living in predominantly low-income, rural communities, the current study sought to investigate the longitudinal associations among father-perpetrated intimate partner violence (IPV) and child-directed physical aggression perpetrated by the mother. The unique contributions of each of these types of family violence on children's behavioral problems at school entry were also examined. Results confirm bidirectional associations between father-perpetrated IPV and maternal physical aggression directed toward the child, and indicate that both types of physical aggression contribute to child behavior problems at school entry.
31035210<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Does social support moderate the relationship between racial discrimination and aggression among Latinx adolescents? A longitudinal study.<<>>INTRODUCTION: This study examined the relationship between racial discrimination by peers and aggression (i.e., self-reported and peer-nominated relational aggression and physical aggression) across one year through the moderation of social support from parents, friends, and teachers. METHODS: Participants were 606 Latinx adolescents from the United States (60% girls; M=14.36, SD=0.46). They completed self-report questionnaires on their perceived racial discrimination by peers, and self-reported and peer-nominated relational and physical aggression. RESULTS & CONCLUSIONS: Racial discrimination by peers was negatively associated with social support from parents, friends, and teachers, as well as positively related to all forms of Time 2 (1 year) self-reported and peer-nominated relational aggression and physical aggression. Social support from parents, friends, and teachers were negatively related to all forms of Time 2 aggressive behaviors. Increases in social support from parents, friends, and teachers weakened the positive association between racial discrimination by peers and Time 2 self-reported and peer-nominated relational aggression, while lower levels of social support strengthened this association. There were no significant moderating effects of social support from parents, social support, and close friends found for Time 2 self-reported and peer-nominated physical aggression. These findings indicate that high social support from parents, friends, and teachers impacts Latinx adolescents reduces the impact of racial discrimination by peers on adolescents' relational aggression.
25337430<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Effects of Thought Suppression on Provoked Men's Alcohol-Related Physical Aggression in the Laboratory.<<>>OBJECTIVE: This study utilized a comprehensive theoretical approach to provide the first data on the impact of thought suppression on provoked men's alcohol-related aggression. METHOD: A diverse community sample (58% African-American) of males between the ages of 21 and 35 (M = 25.25) were randomly assigned to one of two beverage conditions (i.e., alcohol, no-alcohol control). Following beverage consumption, participants were provoked via reception of electric shocks and a verbal insult from a fictitious male opponent. Participants' physical aggression was measured using a shock-based aggression task. RESULTS: Results indicated that acute alcohol intoxication significantly increased physical aggression among lower, but not higher, thought suppressing men. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that, under conditions of interpersonal provocation, alcohol intoxication produces a myopic focus on hostile thoughts and angry affect in lower, but not higher, suppression men. This pattern of results provides support for the durability of the alcohol myopia effect and highlights the need for continued examination of alcohol's role in the disruption of protective factors for men's aggression. It is important for research to continue to identify modifiable cognitive variables that influence self-regulation of behavior; however, it is imperative that researchers consider the extent to which these variables withstand alcohol's effects.
27859182<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Trait Anger, Physical Aggression, and Violent Offending in Antisocial and Borderline Personality Disorders.<<>>Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) are common conditions in forensic settings that present high rates of violence. Personality traits related to the five-factor model personality domains of neuroticism and agreeableness have shown a relationship with physical aggression in nonclinical and general psychiatric samples. The aim of the present investigation was to examine the association of these personality traits with violence and aggression in ASPD and BPD. Results revealed that trait anger/hostility predicted self-reported physical aggression in 47 ASPD and BPD subjects (beta = 0.5, p = 0.03) and number of violent convictions in a subsample of the ASPD participants (beta = 0.2, p = 0.009). These preliminary results suggest that high anger and hostility are associated with physical aggression in BPD and ASPD. Application of validated, self-report personality measures could provide useful and easily accessible information to supplement clinical risk assessment of violence in these conditions.
21251934<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Autonomic reactivity and romantic relational aggression among female emerging adults: moderating roles of social and cognitive risk.<<>>This study investigates the association between autonomic arousal in response to a relational stressor and the perpetration of relational aggression against romantic partners. In addition, the moderating role of social risk (relational victimization by a romantic partner) and cognitive risk (hostile attribution biases) was explored. Skin conductance, heart rate, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia during an experience of exclusion were assessed in a sample of female emerging adults (N=131). Participants provided self-reports of romantic relational aggression, romantic relational victimization, and hostile attribution biases. Results indicated that both heightened and blunted reactivity served as risk factors for the perpetration of romantic relational aggression depending on women's social and contextual risks. Implications for understanding the development of intimate aggression are discussed.
28923255<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Sleep duration and risk of physical aggression against peers in urban youth.<<>>PURPOSE: Optimal sleep takes up one-third of a person's day and is known to be an important component of health and well-being. Shortened sleep duration in adolescence has been found to be associated with adverse health outcomes. In this study, we examined the association between sleep duration and physical aggression against peers among a large representative sample of urban youth, hypothesizing that shorter sleep would lead to more physical aggression. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Data came from the 2008 Boston Youth Survey, an in-school survey of 1878 public high school students. We calculated adjusted odds ratios of past month perpetration of physical aggression, categorized as minor, moderate, or severe, adjusting for school clustering, sex, age, race and ethnicity, hours spent on homework, time watching television, and peer influences. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of students reported insufficient sleep, categorized as 7 or less hours of sleep per school night. Approximately 40% of students reported perpetrating some form of physical aggression at school or in their neighborhood in the past month. Individuals reporting longer sleep duration were significantly less likely to report moderate physical aggressive behavior against peers (adjusted odds ratio=0.90, 95% confidence interval=0.81-1.00). CONCLUSION: In light of the inverse association between hours of sleep and perpetration of aggression, efforts to decrease physical aggression among high school students should include attention to ensuring healthy sleep, including education on the importance of getting 9hours of sleep each night.
18523685<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>The Broader Context of Relational Aggression in Adolescent Romantic Relationships: Predictions from Peer Pressure and Links to Psychosocial Functioning.<<>>The broader context of relational aggression in adolescent romantic relationships was assessed by considering the ways such aggression emerged from prior experiences of peer pressure and was linked to concurrent difficulties in psychosocial functioning. Longitudinal, multi-reporter data were obtained from 97 adolescents and their best friends at age 15 and from adolescents and their romantic partners at age 18. Teens' relational aggression and romantic partners' victimization were predicted from levels of best friends' pressuring behaviors toward teens in an observed interaction as well as from best friends' ratings of how much pressure teens experienced from their peer group. Romantic partner relational aggression and teen victimization were predicted by pressure from teens' peer group only. Adolescents' romantic relational aggression and victimization were also associated with elevated levels of depressive symptoms and increased alcohol use. Results are discussed in terms of the connection of relational aggression in romantic relationships to the broader task of establishing autonomy with peers in psychosocial development.
30741941<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Callous-unemotional traits, low cortisol reactivity and physical aggression in children: findings from the Wirral Child Health and Development Study.<<>>Callous-unemotional (CU) traits are thought to confer risk for aggression via reduced amygdala responsivity to distress cues in others. Low cortisol reactivity is thought to confer risk for aggression via reduced arousal and this effect may be confined to boys. We tested the hypothesis that the association between childhood CU traits and aggression would be greatest in the absence of the inhibitory effects of cortisol reactivity, and that this effect would be sex dependent. Participants were 283 members of a stratified subsample within an epidemiological longitudinal cohort (WCHADS). Cortisol reactivity to a social stressor was assessed at 5 years. CU traits were reported by mothers at 5 years, and physical aggression by mothers and teachers at age 7. Results showed that CU traits were associated with elevated aggression at 7 years controlling for earlier aggression. There was no main effect of cortisol reactivity on regression. The association between CU traits and aggression was moderated by cortisol reactivity (p = .011) with a strong association between CU traits and aggression in the presence of low reactivity, and a small and non-significant association in the presence of high reactivity. This association was further moderated by child sex (p = .041) with the joint effect of high CU traits and low cortisol reactivity seen only in boys (p = .016). We report first evidence that a combined deficit in inhibitory processes associated with CU traits and low cortisol reactivity increases risk for childhood aggression, in a sex-dependent manner.
20529198<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Peer group self-identification as a predictor of relational and physical aggression among high school students.<<>>BACKGROUND: Adolescent peer group self-identification refers to adolescents' affiliation with reputation-based peer groups such as "Goths" or "Jocks." These groups tend to vary on normative characteristics, including the group members' attitudes and behaviors. This article examined whether adolescents' baseline peer group self-identification predicted their self-reported relational and physical aggression 1 year later. METHODS: Self-report data were collected from 1614 students from 9 regular and 9 continuation (alternative) high schools in Southern California, at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Subjects' mean baseline age was 15.21 years (SD = 1.18) and 51.6% of the subjects were female. RESULTS: Findings indicated that compared with self-identified "Regular" or "Normal" students, adolescents who identified with high-risk peer groups (eg, "Druggies,""Goths") tended to report higher relational and physical aggression 1 year later, controlling for baseline aggression and demographic variables. In addition, adolescents' self-identification with high-status peer groups (eg, "Jocks,""Populars") was predictive of higher relational aggression 1 year later. Gender and school type (ie, regular vs continuation) were not found to moderate these effects. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that peer group self-identification is a salient predictor of physical and relational aggression across gender and school type. Adolescents who identify with high-risk peer groups tend to report higher levels of physical as well as relational aggression in the future. In addition, adolescents who affiliate with elite groups tend to become more relationally aggressive over time. School-based prevention programs targeting aggression may benefit from addressing the impacts of peer group self-identification on adolescents' aggressive behavior.
25568459<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>The developmental origins of chronic physical aggression: biological pathways triggered by early life adversity.<<>>Longitudinal epidemiological studies with birth cohorts have shown that physical aggression in humans does not appear suddenly in adolescence as commonly thought. In fact, physically aggressive behaviour is observed as early as 12 months after birth, its frequency peaks around 2-4 years of age and decreases in frequency until early adulthood. However, a minority of children (3-7%) maintain a high frequency of physical aggression from childhood to adolescence and develop serious social adjustment problems during adulthood. Genetic factors and early social experiences, as well as their interaction, have been shown to play an important role in the development of chronic aggressive behaviour. However, the biological mechanisms underlying these associations are just beginning to be uncovered. Recent evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms are responsive to adverse environments and could be involved in the development of chronic aggression. Using both gene candidate and genomic approaches, recent studies have identified epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation alterations in genes involved in the stress response and the serotonin and immune systems to be partly responsible for the long-lasting effects of early adversity. Further longitudinal studies with biological, environmental and behavioural assessments from birth onwards are needed to elucidate the sequence of events that leads to these long-lasting epigenetic marks associated with early adversity and aggression.
19220626<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>An experimental test of parenting practices as a mediator of early childhood physical aggression.<<>>BACKGROUND: Parenting practices predict early childhood physical aggression. Preventive interventions that alter parenting practices and aggression during early childhood provide the opportunity to test causal models of early childhood psychopathology. Although there have been several informative preventive intervention studies that test mediation models in older children, no such studies have been conducted with younger children at high risk for psychopathology. METHOD: Within the context of a randomized controlled trial, we examined whether changes in parenting practices mediate the effects of a family intervention on observed physical aggression among African American and Latino younger siblings of adjudicated youths. RESULTS: Improved parenting practices partially mediated the intervention effect on physical aggression. Improvements in harsh parenting, responsive parenting, and stimulating parenting explained a significant amount of the intervention effect on child physical aggression observed in the context of parent-child interactions. Parenting practices accounted for 38% of the intervention effect on physical aggression. CONCLUSIONS: There was support for the hypothesized model of the prevention of physical aggression during early childhood. Intervention benefits on parenting practices partially accounted for intervention effects on physical aggression in young high-risk children.
26414097<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Costs and benefits of children's physical and relational aggression trajectories on peer rejection, acceptance, and friendships: Variations by aggression subtypes, gender, and age.<<>>This study examined the associations between children's co-occurring relational and physical aggression trajectories and their peer relations (i.e., peer rejection, peer acceptance, and reciprocated friendships) from late childhood (Grade 4; Mage = 10.0) to early adolescence (Grade 8; Mage = 13.9). Using a sample of 477 children (240 girls), the findings indicated there were multiple heterogeneous subgroups of children who followed distinct co-occurring aggression trajectories. For each of these subgroups, multiple indices of their relational development were assessed and findings revealed notable group differences. These results have implications about the potential costs and benefits of aggression, and how its associations with children's peer relationships may vary as a function of aggression subtype, developmental timing, and gender.
24475181<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>DNA methylation signature of childhood chronic physical aggression in T cells of both men and women.<<>>BACKGROUND: High frequency of physical aggression is the central feature of severe conduct disorder and is associated with a wide range of social, mental and physical health problems. We have previously tested the hypothesis that differential DNA methylation signatures in peripheral T cells are associated with a chronic aggression trajectory in males. Despite the fact that sex differences appear to play a pivotal role in determining the development, magnitude and frequency of aggression, most of previous studies focused on males, so little is known about female chronic physical aggression. We therefore tested here whether or not there is a signature of physical aggression in female DNA methylation and, if there is, how it relates to the signature observed in males. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Methylation profiles were created using the method of methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) followed by microarray hybridization and statistical and bioinformatic analyses on T cell DNA obtained from adult women who were found to be on a chronic physical aggression trajectory (CPA) between 6 and 12 years of age compared to women who followed a normal physical aggression trajectory. We confirmed the existence of a well-defined, genome-wide signature of DNA methylation associated with chronic physical aggression in the peripheral T cells of adult females that includes many of the genes similarly associated with physical aggression in the same cell types of adult males. CONCLUSIONS: This study in a small number of women presents preliminary evidence for a genome-wide variation in promoter DNA methylation that associates with CPA in women that warrant larger studies for further verification. A significant proportion of these associations were previously observed in men with CPA supporting the hypothesis that the epigenetic signature of early life aggression in females is composed of a component specific to females and another common to both males and females.
17241490<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>A short-term longitudinal study of growth of relational aggression during middle childhood: associations with gender, friendship intimacy, and internalizing problems.<<>>Trajectories of relational aggression were examined in a large, diverse sample of fourth-grade students. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine relational aggression over 1 calendar year. The results indicated that relational aggression increased in a linear fashion for girls over the course of the study. In addition, increases in friend intimate exchange were associated with time-dependent increases in relational aggression among girls only. Relational aggression and internalizing "tracked" together across the course of the study. Overall, the findings suggest relational aggression becomes increasingly common among elementary school girls, and girls' close, dyadic relationships may fuel relationally aggressive behavior in some contexts. Finally, the results indicate that relational aggression trajectories are dynamically associated with maladjustment.
30620784<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Sex differences in the development of physical aggression: An intergenerational perspective and implications for preventive interventions.<<>>This article reviews the state of knowledge on the development of chronic physical aggression (CPA), with the aim of identifying the most effective prevention strategies. We specifically focus on the early development of physical aggression, on sex differences in the use of physical aggression, and on the transmission of behavior problems from one generation to the other. The body of research on the development of CPA from the past three decades that we review shows increasing evidence that its prevention requires a long-term biopsychosocial developmental approach which also must include an intergenerational perspective. Recent genetic and epigenetic research has indicated that there are both important genetic and environmental effects on gene expression which start at conception. We conclude that one of the most effective strategies to break the intergenerational transmission of CPA involves giving long-term support to pregnant women with a history of behavior problems, their spouse, and their offspring.
27019027<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>A mindfulness-based intervention for self-management of verbal and physical aggression by adolescents with Prader-Willi syndrome.<<>>PURPOSE: There is a dearth of clinical and research literature on the treatment of maladaptive behaviors in adolescents with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based intervention, Meditation on the Soles of the Feet (SoF), to facilitate self-management of verbal and physical aggression. METHOD: We utilized a multiple-baseline design across participants to test the intervention with three adolescents diagnosed with PWS. RESULTS: Relative to baseline, verbal aggression decreased to minimal levels following mindfulness-based practice and physical aggression was nearly eliminated. Intervention effects were maintained at 12-month follow-up. Quantitative analytics confirmed statistically significant outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The SoF mindfulness intervention was effective in reducing verbal and physical aggression in three adolescents with PWS. Future research should test the SoF intervention with this clinical population in a larger clinical trial, and the SoF intervention may be applicable to other pediatric populations.
21994828<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Examining the coping response to peer relational aggression victimization.<<>>Purpose. Relational aggression, rumor spreading, backstabbing, and social isolation, is psychologically damaging for adolescent girls. The purpose of this study was to provide an explanation of victimization response after experiencing peer relational aggression victimization. Methods. Grounded theory techniques were used to gain an understanding of the victimization experience and the coping responses used. Findings. A theory of coping after experiencing peer relational aggression victimization was generated. Girls voiced feelings of hurt and anger after the experience and expressed the following ways of coping as a result: distancing from others, retaliation against the aggressor, discussing their feelings with friends and family, writing their feelings down, and/or confronting the aggressor. Clinical Implications. Nurses should be aware of the phenomenon and asses, for incidences of relational aggression victimization so that they may provide strategies to assist the adolescent and her family with positive coping mechanisms in order to prevent maladaptive responses.
28395529<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Mother-child interactions in young children with excessive physical aggression and in typically developing young children.<<>>BACKGROUND: Among the multiple risk factors, the emergence of conduct problems in young children may be linked to harsh parenting and child's temperamental difficulties, leading to a reciprocal early discordant relationship. Little is known about the characteristics of early parent-child interactions in young children with physical aggression. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the characteristics of mother-child interactions in dyads referred for excessive physical aggression in young children under 5 years of age compared to mother-child interactions in typically developing young children. METHOD: Mother-child interactions were assessed during a free-play session in both a clinical sample ( N = 70, child mean age = 3.5 years) and a nonclinical sample ( N = 80, child mean age = 3.5 years) by using the Rating Scale of Interaction Style (Clark and Seifer, adapted by Molitor and Mayes). RESULTS: Significant differences were found between several interactive features in clinical and nonclinical dyads. In clinical dyads, mothers' behaviors were often characterized by intrusiveness and criticism toward children, and poor facilitative positioning. Children with excessive aggressive behavior often displayed poor communication, initiation of bids, and poor responsiveness toward the mother. They displayed fewer sustained bouts of play than typically developing children did. In clinical dyads, strong positive correlations were found between child responsiveness and maternal interest in engagement ( r = .41, p < .001), while the child displaying sustained bouts of play was negatively correlated with the mother's attempts to intrude on the child's activity ( r = .64, p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: These data show that children with excessive aggressive behavior develop disrupted mother-infant interactions from a very young age. Several negative interactive features and correlations between child behavior and maternal behavior were found in clinical samples. The effects of these features add up and probably strengthen each other, thus leading to interactive difficulties from a very young age. More attention should be paid to early parent-child interactions in case of child behavioral problems. The recognition of these interactive dysfunctions is discussed in terms of clinical implications for therapeutic interventions.
22028205<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Relation of depression and anxiety to self- and peer-reported relational aggression.<<>>The primary purpose of this multimethod and multimeasure study was to identify how the peer relationships of Australian adolescents (ages 9-15 years; N = 335) at school, including relational aggression and victimization, correlated with their symptoms of depression and anxiety. Moreover, relational aggression and victimization were measured via both self- and peer report, and discrepancies between reports were considered as correlates of symptoms and peer relationship status. Adolescents who reported more symptoms of depression and anxiety also self-reported more relational victimization and reported their peers as less trustworthy. Adolescents who overreported their own relational victimization and aggression compared with peer report had more symptoms compared with those who agreed with their peers or underreported their aggression and victimization. Adolescents who underreported their own aggression were not only more socially prominent but were also more disliked by their peers. When considered independent of self-reports, no measure of peer-reported peer status, aggression, or victimization was associated with depressive symptoms; but adolescents reported as more accepted by their peers had fewer anxiety symptoms. Longitudinal research should be conducted to examine adolescents' increasing socioemotional problems as correlates of discrepancies between self- and peer reports of relational aggression and victimization.
19899842<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Etiology and measurement of relational aggression: A multi-informant behavior genetic investigation.<<>>Although the study of relational aggression is gaining attention in the literature, little is known about the underlying causes of this behavior and the relative validity of various informants. These issues were addressed in a sample of 1,981 6- to 18-year-old twin pairs (36% female, 34% male, 30% opposite-sex). Relational aggression was assessed via maternal and self-report using a structured interview. Univariate models estimated genetic and environmental influences by informant and examined evidence for gender differences. A psychometric model combined data from both informants to estimate etiologic influences that were both common to the informants and informant specific. In both sexes, the latent variable reflecting the mother's and child's shared perception of the child's relational aggression was substantially influenced by both additive genetic (63%) and shared environmental (37%) influences, although this latent variable accounted for much greater variance in the maternal report (66%) than it did in the youth report (9%). In addition, informant-specific additive genetic and shared environmental influences were found only for the youth report, with all remaining variance in the mother's report attributed to nonshared environmental influences. Results are discussed in the context of measuring relational aggression and the importance of multiple informants.
29519553<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Voices carry: Effects of verbal and physical aggression on injuries and accident reporting.<<>>Recent years have witnessed a staggeringly high number of workplace aggressive behaviors as well as employee accidents and injuries. Exposure to workplace aggression is associated with a host of negative psychological, emotional, and physiological outcomes, yet research relating workplace aggression to employee safety outcomes is lacking. This study aims to examine the association between exposure to workplace physical and verbal aggression with workplace injuries and underreporting of accidents and near misses. Furthermore, deriving from social exchange theory, we attempt to reveal an underlying mechanism in the association between workplace aggression and underreporting of accidents and near misses. Finally, borrowing from aggression research on intimate relationships, we compare the relative importance of exposure to physical and verbal aggression on workplace injuries and underreporting. Using survey data from 364 public transportation personnel, we found that both verbal and physical aggression significantly predict workplace injuries as well as underreporting. Moreover, mediation analyses found that the relationship between verbal and physical aggression and underreporting was largely explained by an increase in negative reporting attitudes (rather than decreases in safety knowledge or motivation). Compared to exposure to physical aggression, exposure to verbal aggression best predicted employee underreporting of accidents and near misses. However, physical aggression was a better predictor of injuries than verbal aggression. Given these findings, organizational leaders should strive to foster a safe working environment by minimizing interpersonal mistreatment and increasing employee attitudes for reporting accidents.
19083377<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Individual and classroom variables associated with relational aggression in elementary-school aged children: a multilevel analysis.<<>>Relational aggression was studied within classroom environments by examining individual and classroom correlates among 2731 children (3rd-5th graders) during two successive measurement years. Multilevel analyses yielded small gender differences for relational aggression, indicating that such aggressive behavior was more associated with girls as compared to boys. Findings further demonstrated that relational aggression was positively associated with perceived popularity and peer rejection. Relational aggression was also found to be highly stable over time. Additionally, higher classroom aggression norms, reflected by the classroom level for relational aggression, were associated with increased relational aggression in children. Although variation in relational aggression was situated both at class- and individual-level, differences between individuals were considerably larger than differences between classes. Limitations and further research suggestions are provided and practical implications are discussed.
21274856<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Psychopathic personality traits in relational aggression among young adults.<<>>Psychopathy is a robust predictor of overt physical aggression that may also be relevant to relational aggression (RA). This study was conducted to investigate the utility of psychopathic personality traits in the prediction of RA in a sample of 291 college students. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that both primary and secondary psychopathic traits explained additional variance in general/peer and romantic RA beyond physical aggressiveness. Consistent with previous research, no gender differences were found on either form of RA, challenging the popular stereotype of RA as a female behavior. Moreover, psychopathic traits were not differentially predictive of RA by gender or level of physical aggressiveness. Implications of these findings for research and clinical practice are discussed.
21046606<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>The neurocognition of conduct disorder behaviors: specificity to physical aggression and theft after controlling for ADHD symptoms.<<>>There is growing evidence that among the different conduct disorder (CD) behaviors, physical aggression, but not theft, links to low neurocognitive abilities. Specifically, physical aggression has consistently been found to be negatively related to neurocognitive abilities, whereas theft has been shown to be either positively or not related to neurocognition. The specificity of these links needs further examination because attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) links to both physical aggression and neurocognitive variation. The development of self-reported physical aggression and theft, from age 11 to 17 years, was studied in a prospective at-risk male cohort via a dual process latent growth curve model. Seven neurocognitive tests at age 20 were regressed on the growth parameters of physical aggression and theft. The links between neurocognition and the growth parameters of physical aggression and theft were adjusted for ADHD symptoms at ages 11 and 15 (parent, child and teacher reports). Results indicated that verbal abilities were negatively related to physical aggression while they were positively associated with theft. However, inductive reasoning was negatively associated with increases in theft across adolescence. Symptoms of ADHD accounted for part of the neurocognitive test links with physical aggression but did not account for the associations with theft. These differences emphasize the importance of examining specific CD behaviors to better understand their neurodevelopmental mechanisms. They also suggest that youth who engage in different levels of physical aggression or theft behaviors may require different preventive and corrective interventions.
19292848<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Social environments and physical aggression among 21,107 students in the United States and Canada.<<>>BACKGROUND: Physical aggression is an important issue in North American populations. The importance of students' social environments in the occurrence of physical aggression requires focused study. In this study, reports of physical aggression were examined in relation to social environment factors among national samples of students from Canada and the United States. METHODS: Students in grades 6-10 from the United States (n = 14,049) and Canada (n = 7058) who had participated in the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Survey (HBSC) were studied. Rates of students' physical aggression were compared between the 2 countries. School, family, socioeconomic, and peer-related factors were considered as potential risk factors. A simple social environment risk score was developed using the US data and was subsequently tested in the Canadian sample. RESULTS: Risks for physical aggression were consistently higher among United States versus Canadian students, but the magnitude of these differences was modest. The relative odds of physical aggression increased with reported environmental risk. To illustrate, US boys in grades 6-8 reporting the highest social environment risk score (5+) experienced a relative odds of physical aggression 4.02 (95% CI 2.7-5.9) times higher than those reporting the lowest score (adjusted OR for risk scores 0 through 5+ was 1.00, 1.19, 2.10, 2.01, 3.71, and 4.02, respectively, p(trend) < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Unexpectedly, rates of physical aggression and associations between social environments and students' aggression were remarkably similar in Canada and the United States. Family, peer, and school social environments serve as risk or protective factors, with significant cumulative impact on physical aggression in both countries. Given the observed high rates and the many negative effects of aggression on long-term health, school policies aimed at the reduction of such behavior remain a clear priority.
24788255<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Profiles of Maternal Parenting Practices: Exploring the Link With Maternal Delinquency, Offending, Mental Health, and Children's Physical Aggression.<<>>Studies have often linked parenting to children's subsequent antisocial behavior; however, the circumstances under which this might occur are less clear. The current study explores patterns in mothers' parenting practices, and associated correlates including maternal delinquency and offending, mental health, and children's physical aggression. This study is based on the first wave of the ongoing Vancouver Longitudinal Study; the objective of this prospective study is to identify the early risk and protective factors for aggression and violence from the earliest developmental periods. Parenting practices of 287 mothers with preschoolers are examined using a series of latent class analyses. Three different patterns of parenting emerged: Positive, Negative, and Intermittent. Patterns identified are associated with several key criminogenic, socio-demographic, historical, and developmental factors including current maternal adult offending, mothers' mental health, ethnicity, and frequency of children's physical aggression. Importantly, mothers who show parenting in line with the more negative classes also rely on a number of positive practices. Implications of the study suggest that parenting is influenced by mothers' immediate situations and contexts (e.g., current offending rather that past delinquency), which can be targeted for intervention.
30275306<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Metaanalysis of the relationship between violent video game play and physical aggression over time.<<>>To clarify and quantify the influence of video game violence (VGV) on aggressive behavior, we conducted a metaanalysis of all prospective studies to date that assessed the relation between exposure to VGV and subsequent overt physical aggression. The search strategy identified 24 studies with over 17,000 participants and time lags ranging from 3 months to 4 years. The samples comprised various nationalities and ethnicities with mean ages from 9 to 19 years. For each study we obtained the standardized regression coefficient for the prospective effect of VGV on subsequent aggression, controlling for baseline aggression. VGV was related to aggression using both fixed [beta = 0.113, 95% CI = (0.098, 0.128)] and random effects models [beta = 0.106 (0.078, 0.134)]. When all available covariates were included, the size of the effect remained significant for both models [beta = 0.080 (0.065, 0.094) and beta = 0.078 (0.053, 0.102), respectively]. No evidence of publication bias was found. Ethnicity was a statistically significant moderator for the fixed-effects models (P </= 0.011) but not for the random-effects models. Stratified analyses indicated the effect was largest among Whites, intermediate among Asians, and nonsignificant among Hispanics. Discussion focuses on the implications of such findings for current debates regarding the effects of violent video games on physical aggression.
27245759<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>The relationship between physical aggression, foreign policy and moral choices: Phenotypic and genetic findings.<<>>Previous work has demonstrated that both leaders and other individuals vary in dispositional levels of physical aggression, which are genetically influenced. Yet the importance of individual differences in aggression for attitudes toward foreign policy or context-laden moral choices, such as sacrificing the lives of some for the greater good of many, has yet to be fully explored. Given the global importance of such decisions, we undertook this exploration in a sample of 586 Australians, including 250 complete twin pairs. We found that individuals who scored higher on Buss-Perry's physical aggression scale were more likely to support aggressive foreign policy interventions and displayed a more utilitarian moral calculus than those who scored lower on this scale. Furthermore, we found that the majority of variance in physical aggression lay in genetic factors for men, whereas the majority of the variance was in environmental factors for women. The source of covariation between aggression and political choices also differed between the sexes. A combination of genetic and environmental factors accounted for most of the cross-trait correlations among males, whereas common and unique environmental factors accounted for most of the cross-trait correlations among females. We consider the implications of our results for understanding how trait measures of aggression are associated with foreign policy and moral choices, providing evidence for why and how individuals differ in responding to complex social dilemmas.

18174829<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Should relational aggression be included in DSM-V?<<>>OBJECTIVE: Relational aggression was introduced more than a decade ago as a female-typical form of aggression and has become widely used in developmental psychopathology research. In considering whether relational aggression should be included in DSM-V disruptive behavior disorders, we provide data on the reliability and validity of relational aggression when reported by the informants most commonly used to generate clinical diagnoses (parents and youth), the degree of overlap between relational aggression and DSM-IV oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD), and the amount of variance in impairment explained by relational aggression controlling for ODD and CD. METHOD: Data were collected on 9- to 17-year-old girls and boys participating in the population-based Georgia Health and Behavior Study. RESULTS: Reliability and validity of youth and parent reports were adequate. Relational aggression was moderately correlated with symptoms of ODD and CD, and substantial overlap was observed between high levels of relational aggression and meeting symptom criteria for ODD or CD. Relational aggression explained a small but significant amount of unique variance in impairment, controlling for ODD and CD symptoms. At clinically significant levels of impairment, however, there was no additional variance explained by relational aggression. CONCLUSIONS: Some additional information about girls' and boys' functioning is gained by assessing relational aggression using parents and youth as informants, but perhaps not a sufficient amount to warrant inclusion in the nomenclature.
30515840<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Breaking the link: Distraction from emotional cues reduces the association between trait disinhibition and reactive physical aggression.<<>>Research has implicated biased attention allocation toward emotional cues as a proximal mechanism in the association between trait disinhibition and physical aggression. The current study tested this putative cognitive mechanism by incentivizing a shift of attention from a provoking stimulus to a neutral stimulus during a laboratory aggression paradigm. Participants were 119 undergraduate men. They completed a questionnaire that assessed trait disinhibition, were randomly assigned to a distraction or no-distraction control condition, and completed a shock-based aggression task in which they received low and high provocation from a fictitious opponent. A significant positive association between trait disinhibition and physical aggression was found among non-distracted participants exposed to high, but not low, provocation. Distraction from provoking cues significantly attenuated this association. This study is among the first to provide experimental evidence of (a) the positive relation between trait disinhibition and laboratory-based physical aggression, and (b) a potential method for attenuating this association.
22917202<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Relational aggression in children with preschool-onset psychiatric disorders.<<>>OBJECTIVE: The role of preschool-onset (PO) psychiatric disorders as correlates and/or risk factors for relational aggression during kindergarten or first grade was tested in a sample of 146 preschool-age children (age 3 to 5.11 years). METHOD: Axis-I diagnoses and symptom scores were derived using the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment. Children's roles in relational aggression as aggressor, victim, aggressive-victim, or nonaggressor/nonvictim were determined at preschool and again 24 months later at elementary school entry. RESULTS: Preschoolers diagnosed with PO psychiatric disorders were three times as likely as the healthy preschoolers to be classified aggressors, victims, or aggressive-victims. Children diagnosed with PO disruptive, depressive, and/or anxiety disorders were at least six times as likely as children without PO psychiatric disorders to become aggressive-victims during elementary school after covarying for other key risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggested that PO psychiatric disorders differentiated preschool and school-age children's roles in relational aggression based on teacher report. Recommendations for future research and preventative intervention aimed at minimizing the development of relational aggression in early childhood by identifying and targeting PO psychiatric disorders are made.
27171103<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Physical Aggression and Mindfulness among College Students: Evidence from China and the United States.<<>>BACKGROUND: The link between trait mindfulness and several dimensions of aggression (verbal, anger and hostility) has been documented, while the link between physical aggression and trait mindfulness remains less clear. METHOD: We used two datasets: one United States sample from 300 freshmen males from Clemson University, South Carolina and a Chinese sample of 1516 freshmen students from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. Multiple regressions were conducted to examine the association between mindfulness (measured by Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale (MAAS)) and each of the four subscales of aggression. RESULTS: Among the Clemson sample (N = 286), the mindfulness scale had a significant negative association with each of the four subscales of aggression: Hostility: beta = -0.62, p < 0.001; Verbal: beta = -0.37, p < 0.001; Physical: beta = -0.29, p < 0.001; Anger: beta = -0.44, p < 0.001. Among the Shanghai male subsample, the mindfulness scale had a significant negative association with each of the four subscales of aggression: Hostility: beta = -0.57, p < 0.001; Verbal: beta = -0.37, p < 0.001; Physical: beta = -0.35, p < 0.001; Anger: beta = -0.58, p < 0.001. Among the Shanghai female subsample (N = 512), the mindfulness scale had a significant negative association with each of the four subscales of aggression: Hostility: beta = -0.62, p < 0.001; Verbal: beta = -0.41, p < 0.001; Physical: beta = -0.52, p < 0.001; and Anger: beta = -0.64, p < 0.001. DISCUSSION: Our study documents the negative association between mindfulness and physical aggression in two non-clinical samples. Future studies could explore whether mindfulness training lowers physical aggression among younger adults.
21537896<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Hostile intent attributions and relational aggression: the moderating roles of emotional sensitivity, gender, and victimization.<<>>The current study adopts a relational vulnerability model to examine the association between hostile attribution bias and relational aggression. Specifically, the relational vulnerability model implicates the interactive effects of a number of relational risk factors in the development of relational aggression. A sample of 635 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade students (50.2% females) completed a self-report measure assessing hostile attribution bias and emotional distress for relational provocations. Peer nominations and teacher reports of relational aggression and relational victimization were also collected. Results supported the relational vulnerability model for girls only. Specifically, hostile attribution bias was associated with relational aggression only when relational victimization and emotional distress were also high. Implications for future research and clinical practice are discussed.
30995349<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Longitudinal relations between trauma-related psychological distress and physical aggression among urban early adolescents.<<>>There is convincing evidence that trauma-related psychological distress and aggressive behavior are highly related among adolescents. The evidence is less clear regarding the direction of this relation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine reciprocal longitudinal relations between trauma-related distress and physical aggression. METHOD: A predominantly African American sample of early adolescents (N = 2,271; mean age = 12.9) living in an urban, under-resourced community participated in this investigation. The current study used autoregressive cross-lagged models to examine changes across four waves of data within each grade of middle school. RESULTS: Support was found for trauma-related distress uniquely predicting increased levels of physical aggression. This effect was consistent across gender and within and across middle school grades. Conversely, physical aggression did not predict changes in trauma-related distress. CONCLUSIONS: Violence prevention efforts should routinely screen for trauma-related distress.
25208191<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Alcohol expectancies and evaluations of aggression in alcohol-related intimate-partner verbal and physical aggression.<<>>OBJECTIVE: Alcohol aggression expectancies have been found to be associated with increases in aggressive behavior. However, research has not consistently examined evaluations of such behavior. This is unfortunate as both expectancies and evaluations may play a role in whether such behavior will occur. Given this, the current study cross-sectionally examined the associations between alcohol aggression expectancies, evaluations of alcohol-related aggression, indicators of excessive drinking, and alcohol-related verbal and physical aggression. METHOD: The sample consisted of 280 married and cohabiting couples. These couples reported on excessive drinking indicators, alcohol expectancies and evaluations, and alcohol-related verbal and physical aggression during the past year. RESULTS: Findings showed that verbal aggression was positively associated with indicators of excessive drinking among females and with alcohol aggression expectancies for females who evaluated such aggression positively. For males, aggression expectancies and indicators of excessive drinking were positively associated with verbal aggression. For physical aggression, results showed that indicators of excessive drinking and aggression expectancies were associated with physical aggression for females. For males, aggression expectancies were positively associated and evaluations were negatively associated with physical aggression. CONCLUSIONS: These findings add to previous research on alcohol aggression expectancies in close relationships and emphasize the importance of considering evaluations of alcohol-related behavior and how they may play a role in intimate-partner violence and aggression.
31025234<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Emotional Underarousal and Overarousal and Engagement in Relational Aggression: Interactions between Relational Victimization, Physiological Reactivity, and Emotional Sensitivity.<<>>The present study examined if overarousal (i.e., dysregulation and high emotional sensitivity) and underarousal (i.e., fearlessness and emotional insensitivity) to peer stress, reflected in physiological reactivity and subjective emotional sensitivity, exacerbated risk for relational aggression in relationally victimized children. Participants were a community sample of 125 children (10-12 years, M = 11.34 years, SD = 0.89; 45% female). Teachers provided ratings of children's relational victimization and relational aggression. Children's physiological reactivity was assessed based on skin conductance level (SCL) reactivity and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) reactivity to a standardized peer rejection task. Children's subjective emotional sensitivity was assessed using self-reported ratings of distress to hypothetical relational provocation vignettes. Results indicated that relational victimization was significantly associated with relational aggression only for children with high SCL reactivity and high emotional sensitivity (i.e., physiological and subjective overarousal) and for children with low SCL reactivity and low emotional sensitivity (i.e., physiological and subjective underarousal); relational victimization did not predict relational aggression among children with high SCL reactivity but low emotional sensitivity or among children with low SCL reactivity but high emotional sensitivity. Relational victimization was also marginally more strongly associated with relational aggression for children displaying RSA augmentation. Results suggest emotional overarousal and underarousal may both serve as vulnerabilities for relational aggression among relationally victimized youth, and underscore the importance of including physiological and subjective indices of emotional reactivity in studies of aggression. Implications for theory and intervention are discussed.
23163637<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Associations between parental psychological control and relational aggression in children and adolescents: a multilevel and sequential meta-analysis.<<>>Youth aggression has been associated with negative parenting practices, but previous research about this association has mainly focused on physical and verbal aggression. Because more subtle forms of aggression are considered at least as harmful as their physical and verbal counterparts, there is a growing scientific interest in parenting practices that are linked with relational aggression. Guided by social learning theory, a link between youth relational aggression and parental psychological control has been postulated, but the empirical evidence is inconsistent. The present meta-analysis provides a multilevel and sequential quantitative synthesis of 165 dependent effect sizes (23 studies) encompassing 8,958 youths. Across studies, a positive, albeit weak, association between parental psychological control and relational aggression was found. The sequential analysis demonstrated that sufficient cumulative knowledge was attained to yield convincing evidence on this overall association. Moderator analyses revealed that developmental period and assessment method were associated with differences in research findings. Overall, however, results suggest that clarifying the precise role of psychological control in the development and maintenance of relational aggression requires more targeted primary research, which in turn would allow additional and more complex synthesis efforts with potentially more nuanced conclusions.
24662690<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>An exploration of relational aggression in the nursing workplace.<<>>OBJECTIVE: This study provides a 1st look at relational aggression (RA) and the consequences among nurses. BACKGROUND: Interpersonal hostility, bullying, and a toxic work environment (WE) can impact patient care delivery as well as nurses' personal health and job satisfaction. METHODS: The Relational Aggression Assessment Scale, measuring aggressors, victims, and bystanders, was used to measure RA in a sample of 842 nurses. Additional variables measured included a demographic profile, job satisfaction, and intent to leave. RESULTS: Nurses were most likely to identify with victim behaviors, but a minority of nurses reported relying on aggressor behaviors and bystander behaviors. There was a positive correlation among aggressor, victim, and bystander items, suggesting overlap in roles. CONCLUSIONS: A few relationally aggressive individuals can create a toxic WE. Interventions to address RA among nurses must be tested, as well as strategies for improving job satisfaction and promoting healthy WEs through positive relationships.
21666876<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>A Review of Existing Relational Aggression Programs: Strengths, Limitations, and Future Directions.<<>>Research suggests that involvement in relational aggression is associated with serious adjustment problems, including concurrent and future social maladjustment (e.g., problematic friendships; rejection), internalizing problems (e.g., depressive symptoms), and school avoidance. Despite the burgeoning literature focusing on the harmful and damaging nature of relationally aggressive behavior, this research has only recently begun to be used to inform school-based prevention and intervention programming. This article reviews the developmental research related to relational aggression and presents a systematic examination of nine published school-based prevention and intervention programs to prevent relational aggression. Programs reviewed target preschool through eighth-grade students. Strengths and limitations of each program are discussed. Recommendations are offered for future research to develop and validate school-based programming for relational aggression, and implications for school psychologists are discussed.
24691403<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Association of childhood chronic physical aggression with a DNA methylation signature in adult human T cells.<<>>BACKGROUND: Chronic physical aggression (CPA) is characterized by frequent use of physical aggression from early childhood to adolescence. Observed in approximately 5% of males, CPA is associated with early childhood adverse environments and long-term negative consequences. Alterations in DNA methylation, a covalent modification of DNA that regulates genome function, have been associated with early childhood adversity. AIMS: To test the hypothesis that a trajectory of chronic physical aggression during childhood is associated with a distinct DNA methylation profile during adulthood. METHODS: We analyzed genome-wide promoter DNA methylation profiles of T cells from two groups of adult males assessed annually for frequency of physical aggression between 6 and 15 years of age: a group with CPA and a control group. Methylation profiles covering the promoter regions of 20 000 genes and 400 microRNAs were generated using MeDIP followed by hybridization to microarrays. RESULTS: In total, 448 distinct gene promoters were differentially methylated in CPA. Functionally, many of these genes have previously been shown to play a role in aggression and were enriched in biological pathways affected by behavior. Their locations in the genome tended to form clusters spanning millions of bases in the genome. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of clustered and genome-wide variation in promoter DNA methylation in young adults that associates with a history of chronic physical aggression from 6 to 15 years of age. However, longitudinal studies of methylation during early childhood will be necessary to determine if and how this methylation variation in T cells DNA plays a role in early development of chronic physical aggression.
24341618<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>A daily process examination of the temporal association between alcohol use and verbal and physical aggression in community couples.<<>>Alcohol use has been associated with intimate partner aggression perpetration and victimization; however, much of the evidence is based on survey research. Few studies have addressed the proximal effects of drinking episodes on the subsequent occurrence of partner aggression. The current study used daily diary methodology to consider the daily and temporal association between drinking episodes and episodes of partner verbal and physical aggression among a community sample of married and cohabiting couples (N = 118). Male and female partners each provided 56 days of independent daily reports of drinking and partner conflict episodes, including verbal and physical aggression, using interactive voice response technology. Dyadic data analyses, guided by the actor-partner interdependence model, were conducted using hierarchical generalized linear modeling with multivariate outcomes. Daily analyses revealed that alcohol consumption was associated with perpetration of verbal and physical aggression the same day, but not with victimization. Temporal analyses revealed that the likelihood of perpetrating verbal and physical aggression, and the likelihood of being verbally and physically victimized, increased significantly when alcohol was consumed in the previous four hours. Findings did not differ according to gender of perpetrator or victim, and the interaction between perpetrator and victim's alcohol use was not significant in any analysis. The study provides clear evidence that, within a sample of community couples without substance-use disorders or other psychopathology, alcohol consumption by men and women contributes to the occurrence of partner aggression episodes.
21530979<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>The association between valuing popularity and relational aggression: the moderating effects of actual popularity and physiological reactivity to exclusion.<<>>The association between having a reputation for valuing popularity and relational aggression was assessed in a sample of 126 female children and adolescents (mean age = 12.43 years) at a 54-day residential summer camp for girls. Having a reputation for valuing popularity was positively related to relational aggression. This association was moderated by both popularity and physiological reactivity to social exclusion (i.e., respiratory sinus arrhythmia reactivity [RSAR] and heart rate reactivity [HRR]). Popular girls with a reputation for valuing popularity were at greater risk for engaging in relational aggression when they also exhibited blunted reactivity to social exclusion. Conversely, girls who had a reputation for valuing popularity but were not popular (i.e., the "wannabes") were at risk for engaging in relational aggression when they exhibited heightened reactivity to exclusion.
22898873<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Factors associated with physical aggression among US Army soldiers.<<>>There are a growing number of studies that have approximated levels of aggression and associated outcomes among combat veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan using brief screening assessments. However, further research to evaluate the relative role of combat exposures and overt physical behaviors is required to further elucidate potential associations between military service, combat deployment, and overt physical aggression. The purpose of the current study was to assess the prevalence of self-reported physical aggression in a sample of US Army soldiers using an adaptation of the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2), and examine factors associated with higher levels of aggression. A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted at a single US Army Installation within a sample of active duty US Army soldiers (n = 6,128) from two large units. Anonymous surveys were collected 6 months following deployment to measure overt aggressive behaviors, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, traumatic brain injury, and misuse of alcohol. There were a relatively higher number of minor and severe physical overt aggressive actions reported among soldiers who previously deployed, notably highest among deployed soldiers reporting the highest levels of combat intensity. Soldiers screening positive for the misuse of alcohol were also significantly more likely to report relatively higher levels of physical aggression. This study quantified overt aggressive behaviors and associated factors, showing increasing combat exposures may result in increased physical aggression. Clinicians treating service members returning from combat may consider assessing relative levels of combat.
24934013<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Impulsivity and physical aggression: examining the moderating role of anxiety.<<>>Individuals vary in their propensity to engage in aggressive behaviors, and recent research has sought to identify individual differences that contribute to a person's propensity for physical aggression. Previous research has shown that impulsivity and aggression have a consistent relational pattern among many different samples. However, not all impulsive people will engage in aggressive behavior, perhaps because of other factors such as level of physiological arousal from anxiety. Specifically, one factor, namely physiological symptoms of anxiety such as those often associated with panic, may help as a predictor variable to be used in risk assessments or subclassification systems of aggression. Participants included 689 college students who completed self-report questionnaires assessing impulsivity, physical aggression, and anxiety. Multivariate hierarchical regression analyses were conducted. Greater scores on the measure of impulsivity were associated with higher levels of reported physical aggression. The interaction (impulsivity x anxiety) was not statistically significant, suggesting that impulsivity has the same effect on physical aggression regardless of the level of anxiety. There was a main effect for anxiety, which was associated with higher levels of reported physical aggression. Our findings may help inform typologies for identifying predictor variables used in risk assessment and treatment planning.
26300968<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Do girls with depressive symptoms exhibit more physical aggression than boys? A cross sectional study in a national adolescent sample.<<>>BACKGROUND: The relationship between depression and aggressive behaviors in adolescents has previously been reported in clinical and epidemiological studies. However, there is conflicting evidence concerning the effect of gender on this relationship. This study tested whether the link between depressive symptoms and physical aggression differed between boys and girls in a large community-based sample of adolescents. METHODS: A cross-sectional sample of adolescents aged 15-19 (N = 6,677) was studied within the 2007 ESPAD national survey. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Adolescent Depression Rating Scale. We distinguished adolescents with subthreshold levels of depressive symptoms and adolescents with clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms. Physical aggressive behaviors in the last year were reported using items from the Antisocial Behavior Scale. RESULTS: After adjusting for confounding variables, the odds-ratio between depressive symptoms and physical aggressive behaviors was around 1.4. This relationship was stronger for girls than for boys in presence of clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms, but did not differ between the genders in the case of subthreshold levels of depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Girls with severe depressive symptoms were more likely to present physical aggressive behaviors than boys. Future studies will be needed to explore the role of irritability in these differences.
23754265<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>[The mediating role of anger in the relationship between automatic thoughts and physical aggression in adolescents].<<>>OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the mediating role of anger in the relationship between automatic thoughts and physical aggression in adolescents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 224 adolescents in the 9th grade of 3 different high schools in central Burdur during the 2011-2012 academic year. Participants completed the Aggression Questionnaire and Automatic Thoughts Scale in their classrooms during counseling sessions. Data were analyzed using simple and multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: There were positive correlations between the adolescents' automatic thoughts, and physical aggression, and anger. According to regression analysis, automatic thoughts effectively predicted the level of physical aggression (b= 0.233, P < 0.001)) and anger (b= 0.325, P < 0.001). Analysis of the mediating role of anger showed that anger fully mediated the relationship between automatic thoughts and physical aggression (Sobel z = 5.646, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Anger fully mediated the relationship between automatic thoughts and physical aggression. Providing adolescents with anger management skills training is very important for the prevention of physical aggression. Such training programs should include components related to the development of an awareness of dysfunctional and anger-triggering automatic thoughts, and how to change them. As the study group included adolescents from Burdur, the findings can only be generalized to groups with similar characteristics.
29196899<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Trends in the Perpetration of Physical Aggression among Norwegian Adolescents 2007-2015.<<>>Most research on trends in physical aggression has shown declining levels among adolescents during the past two decades. However, few studies have attempted to explain such time trends. Based on two representative cross-sectional surveys of students in the final year of high school in 2007 (N = 6631; 58.8% girls) and 2015 (N = 4145; 60.3% girls), this study reports a substantial decline in physical aggression among Norwegian adolescents. Moreover, mediation analyses show that declining levels in problematic alcohol use and family violence during the same period are plausible explanations for some of this reduction. The results are discussed in light of contemporary changes in socialization of adolescents, and implications for violence prevention are presented.
26580659<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Types of Relational Aggression in Girls Are Differentiated by Callous-Unemotional Traits, Peers and Parental Overcontrol.<<>>Adolescent girls often perpetrate aggression by gossiping and spreading rumours about others, by attempting to ruin relationships and by manipulating and excluding others. Further, males and females engage in reactive and proactive relational aggression differently. In this study, we examined the individual, peer and parental contextual factors that best explained the use of reactive and proactive relational aggression in girls. Female participants (n = 614; ages 11-18 years) completed questionnaires on aggression, callous-unemotional (CU) traits, delinquency, peer delinquency, gender composition of their peer group, resistance to peer influence and perceived parental overcontrol. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the effects of individual, peer- and parent-related variables on the likelihood of being classified as a low aggressor, reactive aggressor or proactive/reactive aggressor. Girls in the combined reactive/proactive aggression group were younger, had greater CU traits, a lower proportion of male peers and greater perception of parental control than both the reactive and low aggressive groups. Both highly aggressive groups were more delinquent and had greater peer delinquency than the low aggressive group. This study suggests those girls who show relational aggression for the purpose of gaining status and revenge feel restrained by their parents and may gravitate toward relationships that support their behaviour.
23658752<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Childhood hyperactivity, physical aggression and criminality: a 19-year prospective population-based study.<<>>BACKGROUND: Research shows that children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder are at elevated risk of criminality. However, several issues still need to be addressed in order to verify whether hyperactivity in itself plays a role in the prediction of criminality. In particular, co-occurrence with other behaviors as well as the internal heterogeneity in ADHD symptoms (hyperactivity and inattention) should be taken into account. The aim of this study was to assess the unique and interactive contributions of hyperactivity to the development of criminality, whilst considering inattention, physical aggression and family adversity. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We monitored the development of a population-based sample of kindergarten children (N = 2,741). Hyperactivity, inattention, and physical aggression were assessed annually between the ages of 6 and 12 years by mothers and teachers. Information on the presence, the age at first charge and the type of criminal charge was obtained from official records when the participants were aged 25 years. We used survival analysis models to predict the development of criminality in adolescence and adulthood: high childhood hyperactivity was highly predictive when bivariate analyses were used; however, with multivariate analyses, high hyperactivity was only marginally significant (Hazard Ratio: 1.38; 95% CI: 0.94-2.02). Sensitivity analyses revealed that hyperactivity was not a consistent predictor. High physical aggression was strongly predictive (Hazard Ratio: 3.44; 95% CI: 2.43-4.87) and its role was consistent in sensitivity analyses and for different types of crime. Inattention was not predictive of later criminality. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Although the contribution of childhood hyperactivity to criminality may be detected in large samples using multi-informant longitudinal designs, our results show that it is not a strong predictor of later criminality. Crime prevention should instead target children with the highest levels of childhood physical aggression and family adversity.
20013045<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Patterns of physical and relational aggression in a school-based sample of boys and girls.<<>>The current study investigated the patterns of aggressive behavior displayed in a sample of 282 students in the 4th through 7th grades (M age = 11.28; SD = 1.82). Using cluster analyses, two distinct patterns of physical aggression emerged for both boys and girls with one aggressive cluster showing mild levels of reactive aggression and one group showing high levels of both reactive and proactive aggression. Both aggressive clusters showed problems with anger dysregulation, impulsivity, thrill and adventure seeking, positive outcome expectancies for aggression, and higher rates of bullying. However, the combined cluster was most severe on all of these variables and only the combined aggressive group differed from non-aggressive students on their level of callous-unemotional traits. Similar patterns of findings emerged for relational aggression but only for girls.
23909644<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Clinical correlates of verbal aggression, physical aggression and inappropriate sexual behaviour after brain injury.<<>>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationships between verbal aggression, physical aggression and inappropriate sexual behaviour following acquired brain injury. RESEARCH DESIGN: Multivariate statistical modelling of observed verbal aggression, physical aggression and inappropriate sexual behaviour utilizing demographic, pre-morbid, injury-related and neurocognitive predictors. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Clinical records of 152 participants with acquired brain injury were reviewed, providing an important data set as disordered behaviours had been recorded at the time of occurrence with the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Trust (BIRT) Aggression Rating Scale and complementary measures of inappropriate sexual behaviour. Three behavioural components (verbal aggression, physical aggression and inappropriate sexual behaviour) were identified and subjected to separate logistical regression modelling in a sub-set of 77 participants. MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Successful modelling was achieved for both verbal and physical aggression (correctly classifying 74% and 65% of participants, respectively), with use of psychotropic medication and poorer verbal function increasing the odds of aggression occurring. Pre-morbid history of aggression predicted verbal but not physical aggression. No variables predicted inappropriate sexual behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: Verbal aggression, physical aggression and inappropriate sexual behaviour following acquired brain injury appear to reflect separate clinical phenomena rather than general behavioural dysregulation. Clinical markers that indicate an increased risk of post-injury aggression were not related to inappropriate sexual behaviour.
28138201<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Asenapine for the Control of Physical Aggression: A Prospective Naturalist Pilot Study.<<>>It has been previously purported that higher relative affinity to the dopamine D4 receptor compared to D2 (i.e., D4/D2 affinity ratio > 1) may underlie unique antiaggression potency. Asenapine is a newer antipsychotic that also has D4/D2 affinity ratio > 1. It has demonstrated efficacy in reducing acute agitation in a placebo-controlled study. We performed a prospective naturalistic, pilot, proof of concept study on an inpatient psychiatric unit. Among patients with aggression at time of admission (>/= 12 on Refined Aggression Questionnaire [RAQ], or >/= 2 on Modified Overt Aggression Scale [MOAS]), asenapine treatment was associated with a significant reduction in total aggression as measured by the MOAS (-14.7 +/- 11.59 vs. -5.4 +/- 10.12, P = 0.045), and particularly physical aggression (-8.0 +/- 5.06 vs. -0.78 +/- 2.40, P < 0.0001) compared to treatment that did not include asenapine. These data suggest that asenapine may be useful in the targeted treatment of aggression, and provide some support for the D4/D2 affinity ratio hypothesis.
18767042<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Moderators of the association between relational aggression and perceived popularity.<<>>This study, which involved two waves of measurement over a period of 12 months, examined first whether the positive association between relational aggression and two types of high status was moderated by social self-efficacy, leadership, cooperation, and peer sociability. It was expected that relational aggressors are most likely to gain high peer group status when they are also self-efficacious or prosocial. Second, this study examined the reciprocal association between relational aggression and high peer status. It was anticipated that relational aggression would contribute to higher perceived popularity and vice versa. Third, we also examined and hypothesized reciprocal effects between social self-efficacy, leadership, cooperation, and peer sociability and perceived popularity. Youth were 540 13-15 year olds participating in Grade 7 (Time 1) and again 1 year later in Grade 8 (Time 2). Data were collected from peers, teachers, and the adolescents themselves. Consistent with expectations, relationally aggressive adolescents high in social self-efficacy, leadership, cooperation, and peer sociability were higher in status than relationally aggressive individuals with low levels of these characteristics. In addition, relational aggression and perceived popularity reciprocally influenced each other. Finally, social self-efficacy, leadership, cooperation, and peer sociability reciprocally influenced and were influenced by perceived popularity.
28530437<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Developmental continuity and change in physical, verbal, and relational aggression and peer victimization from childhood to adolescence.<<>>To investigate the developmental course of aggression and peer victimization in childhood and adolescence, distinct subgroups of children were identified based on similarities and differences in their physical, verbal and relational aggression, and victimization. Developmental continuity and change were assessed by examining transitions within and between subgroups from Grades 1 to 11. This longitudinal study consisted of 482 children (50% females) and was based on peer report data on multiple forms of aggression and peer victimization. Using person-centered methods including latent profile and latent transition analyses, most of the identified subgroups were distinguishable by their frequencies (i.e., levels) of aggression and victimization, rather than forms (physical, verbal, and relational), with the exception of 1 group that appeared to be more form-specific. Across subgroups, multiple developmental patterns emerged characterized as early and late-onset, social interactional continuity, desistance, and heterotypic pathways. Collectively, these pathways support the perspective that the development of aggression and peer victimization in childhood and adolescence is characterized by heterogeneity.

20614370<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Cognitive control reduces sensitivity to relational aggression among adolescent girls.<<>>Relational aggression is a type of aggression that aims to hurt others through relationships and includes behaviors such as gossip and ostracism. This type of aggression is very common among adolescent girls, and in its more intense forms has been linked with poor psychosocial outcomes, including depression and suicide. In the present study we investigated whether individual differences in sensitivity to relational aggression among adolescent girls predicted recruitment of neural networks associated with executive function and cognitive control. Neural response was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging during an affect recognition task that included unfamiliar peer faces. A finding of relatively fewer reports of being victimized by relational aggression was associated with increased recruitment of bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices as well as anterior and posterior cingulate cortices in response to the affect recognition task, as well as with greater competence on behavioral measures of executive function. Our results suggest that girls who are able to recruit specific frontal networks to improve cognitive and executive control are less sensitive to relational aggression.
30932183<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Deviant Peer Factors During Early Adolescence: Cause or Consequence of Physical Aggression?<<>>This study investigated reciprocal relations between adolescents' physical aggression and their perceptions of peers' deviant behaviors and attitudes. Analyses were conducted on four waves of data from 2,290 adolescents (ages 10-16) from three urban middle schools. Autoregression models revealed reciprocal relations between peer factors (i.e., friends' problem behavior, peer pressure for fighting, friends' support for fighting) and adolescents' reporting of their aggressive behavior. Bidirectional relations were also found between peer pressure for fighting and adolescents' frequency of physical aggression based on teacher ratings. Findings were consistent across sex, grade, and time. Findings suggest that multiple dimensions of peers' behaviors uniquely play a role in the development of adolescents' aggression and have important implications for interventions to reduce problem behaviors.
28635021<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>The object of my aggression: Sexual objectification increases physical aggression toward women.<<>>Objectification involves reducing someone to a sexual object, rather than seeing them as a full person. Despite numerous theoretical claims that people are more aggressive toward the objectified, and empirical evidence that objectification is linked to high willingness to aggress, rape proclivity, and aggressive attitudes, no research has examined a causal link between objectification and physical aggression, particularly in the context of provocation. In two experiments, we examined this predicted link. In Experiment 1, using a 2 (objectification: no/yes) x 2 (provocation: no/yes) factorial between-subjects design, we investigated the effects of objectification, induced via body focus during a face-to-face interaction, and provocation on physical aggression toward a female confederate. Our results revealed a significant main effect of provocation, a marginal main effect of objectification, and a significant interaction between these variables. In the absence of a provocation, focusing on a woman's body increased aggression toward her. Experiment 2 replicated Experiment 1 using a video of a target woman instead of a face-to-face interaction. Again, our results showed a significant two-way interaction between objectification and provocation, wherein objectification increased aggression in the absence of provocation. Overall, this research indicates that objectification can lead to heightened physical aggression toward objectified women.
21299275<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Relational benefits of relational aggression: adaptive and maladaptive associations with adolescent friendship quality.<<>>Two longitudinal studies examined associations between relational aggression and friendship quality during adolescence. In Study 1, 62 adolescents in Grades 6 (25.8%), 7 (32.3%), and 8 (41.9%) completed assessments of friendship affiliations, relational and overt aggression, and friendship quality at 2 time points, 1 year apart. Results using actor partner interdependence modeling indicated that high levels of relational aggression predicted increases in self-reported positive friendship quality 1 year later. In Study 2, 56 adolescents in Grades 9 (66.7%) and 10 (33.3%) attended a laboratory session with a friend in which their conversations were videotaped and coded for relationally aggressive talk. Target adolescents completed measures of positive and negative friendship quality during the laboratory session and during a follow-up phone call 6 months later. Analyses revealed that high levels of relationally aggressive talk at Time 1 predicted increases in negative friendship quality 6 months later. In addition, among adolescents involved in a reciprocal best friendship, high levels of observed relationally aggressive talk predicted increases in positive friendship quality over time. Taken together, these studies provide support for the idea that relational aggression may be associated with adaptive as well as maladaptive outcomes within the dyadic context of adolescent friendship.
31084410<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Physical aggression, relational aggression and anger in preschool children: The mediating role of emotion regulation.<<>>In early years, anger in children may cause aggressive behaviors. Previous studies show that the development of emotion regulation decreases anger and aggression in children. In this study, the mediating role of emotion regulation in the relationship between children's anger expression levels and their physical and relational aggression was investigated using structural equation modeling. The participants of the study consisted of 751 36- to 72-month old children living in Turkey (384 males, 50.7%; 367 females, 49.3%; average of age = 4.13; SD = .78). The data on anger-expressing levels and emotion-regulation skills of children were evaluated by their mothers, and the data on their physical and relational aggression levels were evaluated by their teachers. Expressions of anger indirectly predicted both physical aggression (beta = .14, p < .01) and relational aggression (beta = .10, p < .01) through emotion regulation significantly. The emotion regulation has the full mediator role in the relation between anger, physical, and relational aggression. The results further showed that children's feelings of anger may not turn into aggressive behavior, thus the study emphasizes the importance of supporting the development of emotion-regulation skills in the preschool period.
30511052<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Patterns of Oral-Maxillofacial Trauma and Determinant Factors among Brazilian Victims of Physical Aggression: A 4-Year Study.<<>>PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of oral-maxillofacial trauma among Brazilian victims of physical aggression and identify its associated factors from a medico-legal and forensic perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out involving the analysis of complete medico-legal and social reports of 3668 victims of physical aggression treated at a centre of legal medicine and forensic dentistry over the course of four years. The dependent variable was the occurrence of oral-maxillofacial trauma. The independent variables were sociodemographic status and characteristics of physical aggression. Statistical analyses included the chi-squared test (p < 0.05) as well as univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Oral-maxillofacial trauma occurred in 1655 cases (45.1%). Individuals who lived in suburban areas (OR = 1.32; 95%CI = 1.11-1.58) and those who were victims of community violence (OR = 1.20; 95%CI = 1.03-1.40) perpetrated by someone known to them (OR = 1.24; 95%CI = 1.03-1.40) using physical force (OR = 2.31; 95%CI = 1.96-2.72) on weekends (OR = 1.19; 95%CI = 1.04-1.37) and during nighttime hours (OR = 1.23; 95%CI = 1.08-1.41) were more likely to exhibit oral-maxillofacial trauma. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of oral-maxillofacial trauma was high and the associated factors were area of residence, type of violence, type of offender, mechanism of violence, day, and period of occurrence.
17598804<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Relational aggression, gender, and the developmental process.<<>>TOPIC: Defining and exploring the concept of relational aggression, or the purposeful intent to inflict harm on another through a social relationship. PURPOSE: This study aims to describe the concept of relational aggression as it has been shaped through recent research, to contrast relational aggression with other types of aggression, and to explore the influence of gender and the formation of a self-concept in the development of relational aggression. SOURCES: A review of the literature from 1969 to 2005 from selected nursing, child development, women's studies, and psychology publications. CONCLUSIONS: Some degree of relational aggression seems to be a normal response to conflict for many girls, from preschool through adolescence; however, more research needs to be conducted to determine at what level, or what subtypes, of relational aggression are predictive of future deviant behavior.
19589597<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Experiences of psychological and physical aggression in adolescent romantic relationships: links to psychological distress.<<>>OBJECTIVE: This research examined links between adolescents' experiences of psychological and physical relationship aggression and their psychological distress. Experiences of psychological and physical aggression were expected to correlate positively with symptoms of psychological distress, but experiences of psychological aggression were expected to partially account for the association between experiences of physical aggression and psychological distress. In addition, psychological aggression was hypothesized to be perceived as more unpleasant and less playful than physical aggression. METHOD: Participants were 125 high school students. Relationship aggression was assessed over an 8-week period using two methods: (1) a retrospective method based on a single assessment at the end of the 8-week period, and (2) a cumulative method based on multiple assessments conducted during the 8-week period. Adolescents' appraisals of the aggression were also measured, as were their reports of symptoms of psychological distress. RESULTS: Adolescents' experiences of psychological and physical relationship aggression correlated positively, but inconsistently, with their symptoms of psychological distress. In analyses considering both forms of aggression simultaneously, psychological aggression was related to adolescents' distress, but physical aggression was not. This finding emerged across both methods of assessing for relationship aggression. Psychological aggression was more likely than physical aggression to be rated as unpleasant, and less likely to be attributed to the partner "playing around." CONCLUSIONS: The study of adolescent relationship aggression will benefit by expanding the focus of aggression to include psychological aggression as well as physical aggression, and by examining adolescents' appraisals of the aggression they experience. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The findings highlight the importance of a broad view of aggression in adolescent relationships. Psychological aggression appears to be at least as important to adolescent well-being as physical aggression in dating relationships. In addition, it may be useful to consider how adolescents' interpret the intent of the aggression that they experience.
17635260<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>A concept analysis of relational aggression.<<>>The purpose of this article is to conduct a concept analysis of the phenomenon of relational aggression. With the increases in violence among our youth, the topic of aggression, and more specifically relational aggression, has gained an increasing interest. Discussion of relational aggression is imperative because it lends credence to a type of aggression not readily studied in previous decades. A new understanding of relational aggression will aide in future nursing and multidisciplinary research studies and will guide health promotion interventions to alleviate the consequences of relational aggression for adolescent girls. Therefore, with an increased knowledge about the consequences of relational aggression the nurse can provide appropriate nursing interventions to combat the detriment associated with it.
23977113<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Differential DNA methylation regions in cytokine and transcription factor genomic loci associate with childhood physical aggression.<<>>BACKGROUND: Animal and human studies suggest that inflammation is associated with behavioral disorders including aggression. We have recently shown that physical aggression of boys during childhood is strongly associated with reduced plasma levels of cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10, later in early adulthood. This study tests the hypothesis that there is an association between differential DNA methylation regions in cytokine genes in T cells and monocytes DNA in adult subjects and a trajectory of physical aggression from childhood to adolescence. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We compared the methylation profiles of the entire genomic loci encompassing the IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-8 and three of their regulatory transcription factors (TF) NFkB1, NFAT5 and STAT6 genes in adult males on a chronic physical aggression trajectory (CPA) and males with the same background who followed a normal physical aggression trajectory (control group) from childhood to adolescence. We used the method of methylated DNA immunoprecipitation with comprehensive cytokine gene loci and TF loci microarray hybridization, statistical analysis and false discovery rate correction. We found differentially methylated regions to associate with CPA in both the cytokine loci as well as in their transcription factors loci analyzed. Some of these differentially methylated regions were located in known regulatory regions whereas others, to our knowledge, were previously unknown as regulatory areas. However, using the ENCODE database, we were able to identify key regulatory elements in many of these regions that indicate that they might be involved in the regulation of cytokine expression. CONCLUSIONS: We provide here the first evidence for an association between differential DNA methylation in cytokines and their regulators in T cells and monocytes and male physical aggression.
21963609<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Cardiovascular reactivity and proactive and reactive relational aggression among women with and without a history of sexual abuse.<<>>This study examined the association between cardiovascular reactivity and proactive and reactive functions of relational aggression among women with and without a history of sexual abuse. Heart rate reactivity, blood pressure reactivity, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia reactivity while recounting a relational stressor (e.g., being left out) were assessed. Participants provided self-reports of relational aggression and a history of sexual abuse prior to age 16. Results indicated that cardiovascular reactivity was only associated with relational aggression among women with a history of sexual abuse. In addition, whereas blunted reactivity was associated with proactive relational aggression, exaggerated reactivity was associated with reactive relational aggression. These findings highlight the importance of considering contextual moderators of the association between cardiovascular reactivity and aggression; moreover, results highlight distinct cardiovascular correlates of different functions of aggression. Finally, the findings underscore the need for additional research examining the physiological correlates of aggressive behavior among women.
24549721<<>>Frustrative_Nonreward<<>>Early development of physical aggression and early risk factors for chronic physical aggression in humans.<<>>This chapter describes the state of knowledge on the development of physical aggression from early childhood to adulthood, the long term outcomes of chronic physical aggression during childhood and the risk factors for chronic physical aggression. Unraveling the development of physical aggression is important to understand when and why humans start using physical aggression, to understand why some humans suffer from chronic physical aggression and to understand how to prevent the development of this disorder which causes much distress to the aggressors and their victims. The study of the developmental origins of aggression also sheds light on the reasons why situational prevention of aggression is important at all ages and in all cultures.
28454858<<>>Loss<<>>The relationship between cell phone use and management of driver fatigue: It's complicated.<<>>INTRODUCTION: Voice communication may enhance performance during monotonous, potentially fatiguing driving conditions (Atchley & Chan, 2011); however, it is unclear whether safety benefits of conversation are outweighed by costs. The present study tested whether personalized conversations intended to simulate hands-free cell phone conversation may counter objective and subjective fatigue effects elicited by vehicle automation. METHOD: A passive fatigue state (Desmond & Hancock, 2001), characterized by disengagement from the task, was induced using full vehicle automation prior to drivers resuming full control over the driving simulator. A conversation was initiated shortly after reversion to manual control. During the conversation an emergency event occurred. RESULTS: The fatigue manipulation produced greater task disengagement and slower response to the emergency event, relative to a control condition. Conversation did not mitigate passive fatigue effects; rather, it added worry about matters unrelated to the driving task. Conversation moderately improved vehicle control, as measured by SDLP, but it failed to counter fatigue-induced slowing of braking in response to an emergency event. Finally, conversation appeared to have a hidden danger in that it reduced drivers' insights into performance impairments when in a state of passive fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Automation induced passive fatigue, indicated by loss of task engagement; yet, simulated cell phone conversation did not counter the subjective automation-induced fatigue. Conversation also failed to counter objective loss of performance (slower braking speed) resulting from automation. Cell phone conversation in passive fatigue states may impair drivers' awareness of their performance deficits. Practical applications: Results suggest that conversation, even using a hands-free device, may not be a safe way to reduce fatigue and increase alertness during transitions from automated to manual vehicle control.
30248733<<>>Loss<<>>[Comparison of knowledge and behavior toward hearing protection among workers in different workplaces and its influence factors].<<>>Objective: To compare the knowledge and behavior toward hearing protection among workers in different workplaces and investigate its influence factors. Methods: 2 manufacturing companies with obvious noise hazard in workplace were selected into the study. Health management level was distinguished through field investigation and verification. Questionnaire focus on basic knowledge of hearing health, acceptance level of noise hazard, comfort of wearing hearing protectors and atmosphere in workplace was designed and was used to investigate the knowledge and behavior toward hearing protection. Results: Hearing protectors that meet the level of protection are distributed throughout the workplaces. Although company A has a lower noise hazards level, the health management system was poorly executed. The proportion of workers persisting in wearing hearing protectors throughout the work shift in company A was lower than B (P<0.01) . Workers in company A intended to underestimate the noise level (P<0.01) and the health effect of hearing loss (P<0.01) . All the workers were worry about suffering from hearing loss (P>0.05) , but those in company B had more positive attitude toward the protection of hearing protector (P<0.01) and relied on the protector (P<0.01) . The awareness of protection, in turn, help workers adapt attitude and get used to wearing hearing protectors consciously in workplace (P<0.01) . Conclusion: Health management performance play a key role in help workers form good knowledge and behavior. To protect workplace health, employers need to creative a healthy supportive environment for workers.
17149110<<>>Loss<<>>Watching & worrying: early pregnancy after loss experiences.<<>>PURPOSE: To describe women's early pregnancy after loss experiences (up to 25 weeks gestation), to document the timing and frequency of their common discomforts and events, and to explore changes in these over time. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal, qualitative descriptive, and triangulated (data, methods, analyses). METHODS: Qualitative data were collected from 82 women pregnant after a past perinatal loss, who were followed through their 25th week gestation. Field notes were taken on all women; 75 women recorded events of their pregnancy through text and stickers on an investigator-supplied calendar. Thematic analysis was done from field notes and hand-written calendar entries; content analysis was conducted on sticker-entered events and symptoms. RESULTS: Themes identified in the data were Growing Confident, Fluctuating Worry, Interpreting Signs, Managing Pregnancy, and Having Dreams. The first four themes comprise the see-saw nature of these pregnancies. Managing Pregnancy includes the subthemes of Being Hypervigilant, Seeking Reassurance, and Relying on Internal Beliefs. The theme of Having Dreams was a serendipitous finding, in the sense that women reported their dreams without prompting, but the data did not reach saturation. Future research in this area is suggested. Calendar stickers indicate that fatigue and headaches are the most commonly reported discomforts. Fetal movement, felt by all the women by 25 weeks gestation, was very reassuring. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Nurses should understand that women who have experienced a previous pregnancy loss have omnipresent worry and anxiety during a subsequent pregnancy, and seek reassurance that their pregnancy and baby are okay. Therefore, the frequent calls and visits to healthcare providers from these women represent their most common and comforting way of coping with their worry.
30587168<<>>Loss<<>>'What kind of life is this?' Diabetes related notions of wellbeing among adults in eastern Uganda and implications for mitigating future chronic disease risk.<<>>BACKGROUND: Effective prevention and care for type 2 diabetes requires that people link healthy behaviours to chronic disease-related wellbeing. This study explored how people perceive current and future wellbeing, so as to inform lifestyle education. METHODS: Eight focus group discussions and 12 in-depth interviews were conducted in Iganga and Mayuge districts in rural Eastern Uganda among people aged 35-60 years in three risk categories (1) People with diabetes, (2) people at higher risk of diabetes (with hypertension or overweight) and (3) community members without diabetes. RESULTS: People define wellbeing in three notions: 1) Physical health, 2) Socio-economic status and 3) Aspirational fulfilment. Most people hold the narrower view of wellbeing that focuses on absence of pain. Most overweight participants did not feel their condition as affecting their wellbeing. However, for several people with hypertension, the pains they describe indicate probable serious heart disease. Some people with diabetes expressed deep worry and loss of hope, saying that 'thoughts are more bothersome than the illness'. Wellbeing among people with diabetes was described in two perspectives: Those who view diabetes as a 'static' condition think that they cannot attain wellbeing while those who view it as a 'dynamic' condition think that with consistent treatment and healthy lifestyles, they can be well. While many participants perceive future wellbeing as important, people without diabetes are less concerned about it than those with diabetes. Inadequate knowledge about diabetes, drug stock-outs in health facilities, unaffordable healthier food, and contradictory information were cited as barriers to future wellbeing in people with diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: To make type 2 diabetes prevention relevant to healthy people, health education messages should link current lifestyles to future wellbeing. Diabetes patients need counselling support, akin to that in HIV care, to address deep worry and loss of hope.
26988765<<>>Loss<<>>Association of work productivity with clinical and patient-reported factors in patients infected with hepatitis C virus.<<>>Patients with HCV infection have reduced work productivity (WP), in terms of both presenteeism (impairment in work productivity while working) and absenteeism (productivity loss due to absence from work). The aim of this study was to identify clinical and patient-reported factors that are predictive of WP in HCV-infected patients. HCV-infected patients enrolled in clinical trials completed 3 PRO questionnaires (CLDQ-HCV, SF-36 and FACIT-F) and one work productivity (WPAI:SHP) questionnaire. In employed subjects, work productivity and its absenteeism and presenteeism components were calculated using WPAI:SHP instrument. Of 4121 HCV-infected patients with work productivity data, 2480 (60.2%) reported to be employed, and of those, 2190 had completed all PRO questionnaires before treatment initiation. Of the study cohort, 519/2190 (23.7%) had severe work impairment. In multiple linear regression analysis, work productivity was predicted by lower scores in activity/energy domain of CLDQ-HCV, physical well-being domain of FACIT-F, worry domain of CLDQ-HCV and role physical domain of SF-36 (all P < 0.0005). Furthermore, presenteeism was independently predicted by the activity/energy of CLDQ-HCV, physical well-being of FACIT-F, worry domain of CLDQ-HCV, role physical scale of SF-36 and fatigue scale of FACIT-F (P < 0.002). Finally, absenteeism was independently predicted by physical well-being scale of FACIT-F and role physical scale of SF-36 (all P < 0.002). Clinically, work productivity impairment was predicted by the presence of cirrhosis, anxiety, depression and clinically overt fatigue (P < 0.01). Thus, the most important drivers of WP in HCV are impairment of physical aspects of PROs and clinical history of depression, anxiety, fatigue and cirrhosis.
28676467<<>>Loss<<>>The Rules of Engagement: Perspectives on Secure Messaging From Experienced Ambulatory Patient Portal Users.<<>>BACKGROUND: Patient portals have shown promise in engaging individuals in self-management of chronic conditions by allowing patients to input and track health information and exchange secure electronic messages with their providers. Past studies have identified patient barriers to portal use including usability issues, low health literacy, and concerns about loss of personal contact as well as provider concerns such as increased time spent responding to messages. However, to date, studies of both patient and provider perspectives on portal use have focused on the pre-implementation or initial implementation phases and do not consider how these issues may change as patients and providers gain greater experience with portals. OBJECTIVE: Our study examined the following research question: Within primary care offices with high rates of patient-portal use, what do experienced physician and patient users of the ambulatory portal perceive as the benefits and challenges of portal use in general and secure messaging in particular? METHODS: This qualitative study involved 42 interviews with experienced physician and patient users of an ambulatory patient portal, Epic's MyChart. Participants were recruited from the Department of Family Medicine at a large Academic Medical Center (AMC) and included providers and their patients, who had been diagnosed with at least one chronic condition. A total of 29 patients and 13 primary care physicians participated in the interviews. All interviews were conducted by telephone and followed a semistructured interview guide. Interviews were transcribed verbatim to permit rigorous qualitative analysis. Both inductive and deductive methods were used to code and analyze the data iteratively, paying particular attention to themes involving secure messaging. RESULTS: Experienced portal users discussed several emergent themes related to a need for greater clarity on when and how to use the secure messaging feature. Patient concerns included worry about imposing on their physician's time, the lack of provider compensation for responding to secure messages, and uncertainty about when to use secure messaging to communicate with their providers. Similarly, providers articulated a lack of clarity as to the appropriate way to communicate via MyChart and suggested that additional training for both patients and providers might be important. Patient training could include orienting patients to the "rules of engagement" at portal sign-up, either in the office or through an online tutorial. CONCLUSIONS: As secure messaging through patient portals is increasingly being used as a method of physician-patient communication, both patients and providers are looking for guidance on how to appropriately engage with each other using this tool. Patients worry about whether their use is appropriate, and providers are concerned about the content of messages, which allow them to effectively manage patient questions. Our findings suggest that additional training may help address the concerns of both patients and providers, by providing "rules of engagement" for communication via patient portals.
29603147<<>>Loss<<>>Timely follow-up of positive cancer screening results: A systematic review and recommendations from the PROSPR Consortium.<<>>Timely follow-up for positive cancer screening results remains suboptimal, and the evidence base to inform decisions on optimizing the timeliness of diagnostic testing is unclear. This systematic review evaluated published studies regarding time to follow-up after a positive screening for breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancers. The quality of available evidence was very low or low across cancers, with potential attenuated or reversed associations from confounding by indication in most studies. Overall, evidence suggested that the risk for poorer cancer outcomes rises with longer wait times that vary within and across cancer types, which supports performing diagnostic testing as soon as feasible after the positive result, but evidence for specific time targets is limited. Within these limitations, we provide our opinion on cancer-specific recommendations for times to follow-up and how existing guidelines relate to the current evidence. Thresholds set should consider patient worry, potential for loss to follow-up with prolonged wait times, and available resources. Research is needed to better guide the timeliness of diagnostic follow-up, including considerations for patient preferences and existing barriers, while addressing methodological weaknesses. Research is also needed to identify effective interventions for reducing wait times for diagnostic testing, particularly in underserved or low-resource settings. CA Cancer J Clin 2018;68:199-216.

26685323<<>>Loss<<>>Study on the psychosocial aspects of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers in Japan: a preliminary report.<<>>OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the psychosocial aspects of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy in Japan. METHODS: The subjects were 16 patients who underwent risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy at the Cancer Institute Hospital. Worry about cancer, emotional state and cancer-specific distress level were evaluated using a four-point Likert scale, the Profile of Mood States-Short Form and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, respectively, before and 1 year after the surgery. In addition, the subjects were interviewed regarding their expectation for the risk-reducing surgery, the effects of the surgery, and the recovery from surgery, before the surgery and at 1, 6 and 12 months after the surgery. A t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for the analysis, and literal analects were prepared for the interview and the answers were organized per question item using NVIVO10. RESULTS: The results revealed that the total score for worry about breast cancer and ovarian cancer (P = 0.021) as well as the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (P = 0.021) were significantly lower 1 year after surgery, compared with the values before the surgery. Regarding the preoperative expectations for the surgery, the expectation for reducing the cancer risk was the highest. The reported effects of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy on life included the appearance of menopausal symptoms, a loss of motivation and poor concentration; more effects were reported at 1 year after surgery than at 6 months after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy can be effective for reducing worry about breast cancer and ovarian cancer and cancer-specific distress as well as contributing to a reduction in mortality from fallopian tube and ovarian related cancer.
28323747<<>>Loss<<>>Supporting a Youth with Cerebellar Ataxia into Adolescence.<<>>CASE: Zoe, a 13-year-old white girl, presents as a new patient to your pediatric clinic with complaints of frequent emesis, anxiety, and learning problems, and previous diagnosis of cerebellar ataxia. Parents accompany Zoe and state, "it is really hard for her to go out, she gets sick and falls easily." She was born full term by vaginal delivery without complications. Given globally delayed milestones, she received early intervention services. Feeding problems began at infancy, including gastroesophageal reflux and aspiration pneumonia.At age 2, Zoe saw a neurologist and brain MRI revealed cerebellar atrophy. She recently saw a geneticist and genetic studies are pending. Parents report receiving "little" information regarding prognosis; through their own research, they read about individuals having similar symptoms in adulthood, with a degenerative pattern. They worry that Zoe is "still very young and we do not know what her future will be like."Despite ongoing speech and feeding challenges, the parents report difficulty finding a speech and language therapist in their area. Zoe does see an otolaryngologist for frequent otitis media and hearing loss and an ophthalmologist for vision problems. Still, she continues to fall further behind in school. Furthermore, she is intensely afraid of falling at school and has few friends, resulting in the family being at a loss regarding "what to do about school."She lives with both parents and 2 healthy older sisters. Her mother has Crohn's disease and has been unable to work. Her maternal aunt is close to Zoe and has hypothyroidism. Her father works as an insurance agent and resources have been "tight." Zoe's mother describes "making" Zoe go out to the movies, "otherwise she just stays home." Zoe usually needs assistance to walk in public, to keep from stumbling. Parents share that simply being in a public place or meeting a new physician may trigger emesis. Zoe does enjoy interacting with neighborhood children and says she wants to be "normal," wear nail polish, and date. She seeks independence, often refusing to use her wheelchair. Parents feel she requires more intensive occupational and physical therapy.On examination, she is very slender with hypertelorism and nystagmus. Holding an emesis bag, she gags intermittently, producing clear secretions. She has a notable tremor and walks slightly stooped with wide-based gait. Her few words demonstrate articulation differences and cognitive expression characteristic of a younger child. She wears light make-up and age-appropriate clothes. She asks, "When can I go home?"At the end of the visit, parents share their worry that Zoe is "so young and we do not know anything, what to expect, or what to tell her." As the family's new medical home, they ask you to weigh in on what to do next to best support her? Where do you begin?
26490569<<>>Loss<<>>Gray and white matter volume abnormalities in generalized anxiety disorder by categorical and dimensional characterization.<<>>Increasing efforts have been made to investigate the underlying pathophysiology of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), but only limited consistent information is available on gray (GM) and white matter (WM) volume changes in affected adults. Additionally, few studies employed dimensional approaches to GAD pathology. This study compares structural brain imaging data from n=19 GAD subjects and n=24 healthy comparison (HC) subjects, all medication-free and matched on age, sex and education. Separate categorical and dimensional models were employed using voxel-based morphometry for GM and WM. Significantly higher GM volumes were found in GAD subjects mainly in basal ganglia structures and less consistently in the superior temporal pole. For WM, GAD subjects showed significantly lower volumes in the dlPFC. Largely consistent findings in dimensional and categorical models point toward these structural alterations being reliable and of importance for GAD. While lower volume in the dlPFC could reflect impaired emotional processing and control over worry in GAD, basal ganglia alterations may be linked to disturbed gain and loss anticipation as implicated in previous functional GAD studies. As perturbations in anticipation processes are central to GAD, these areas may warrant greater attention in future studies.
15589775<<>>Loss<<>>Validating a pencil-and-paper measure of perimenopausal menstrual blood loss.<<>>In the study presented here, we describe our efforts to develop and validate a new measurement tool for perimenopausal menstrual blood loss. We validate this simple-to-use, subjective pencil-and-paper scale, the Mansfield-Voda-Jorgensen Menstrual Bleeding Scale (MVJ), against an objective measure, the weight of used menstrual products. Thirty-one women from the Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN region saved all their used products over three menstrual cycles, storing them in airtight zip bags, and rated their menstrual fluid volume loss using the MVJ. The overall correlation between MVJ scores and log discharge rate was quite high (r = 0.683); all MVJ categories were statistically unique with the exception of categories "1" and "2." The overall fit, then, was particularly good at the heavy bleeding end of the scale. When five women with poor performance were removed, the correlations ranged from 0.480-0.894. The MVJ is a promising tool for identifying women with excessive menstrual bleeding. It is a simple-to-use, pencil-and-paper scale that offers an inexpensive and practical method to clinicians who work with perimenopausal women, the group most vulnerable to unnecessary worry and/or interventions when menorrhagia is incorrectly diagnosed.
27010424<<>>Loss<<>>Long-term effects of very low-carbohydrate and high-carbohydrate weight-loss diets on psychological health in obese adults with type 2 diabetes: randomized controlled trial.<<>>BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Very low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LC) diets are used for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) management, but their effects on psychological health remain largely unknown. This study examined the long-term effects of an LC diet on psychological health. METHODS: One hundred and fifteen obese adults [age: 58.5 +/- 7.1 years; body mass index: 34.6 +/- 4.3 kg m(-2) ; HbA1c : 7.3 +/- 1.1%] with T2DM were randomized to consume either an energy-restricted (~6 to 7 MJ), planned isocaloric LC or high-carbohydrate, low-fat (HC) diet, combined with a supervised exercise programme (3 days week(-1) ) for 1 year. Body weight, psychological mood state and well-being [Profile of Mood States (POMS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (SAI)] and diabetes-specific emotional distress [Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) Questionnaire] and quality of life [QoL Diabetes-39 (D-39)] were assessed. RESULTS: Overall weight loss was 9.5 +/- 0.5 kg (mean +/- SE), with no difference between groups (P = 0.91 time x diet). Significant improvements occurred in BDI, POMS (total mood disturbance and the six subscales of anger-hostility, confusion-bewilderment, depression-dejection, fatigue-inertia, vigour-activity and tension-anxiety), PAID (total score) and the D-39 dimensions of diabetes control, anxiety and worry, sexual functioning and energy and mobility, P < 0.05 time. SAI and the D-39 dimension of social burden remained unchanged (P >/= 0.08 time). Diet composition had no effect on the responses for the outcomes assessed (P >/= 0.22 time x diet). CONCLUSION: In obese adults with T2DM, both diets achieved substantial weight loss and comparable improvements in QoL, mood state and affect. These results suggest that either an LC or HC diet within a lifestyle modification programme that includes exercise training improves psychological well-being.
28990835<<>>Loss<<>>Children exposed to a natural disaster: psychological consequences eight years after 2004 tsunami.<<>>BACKGROUND: There is a need for studies that follow up children and adolescents for many years post disaster since earlier studies have shown that exposure during natural disasters constitutes a risk factor for poor psychological health. AIMS: The main aim was to examine whether there was an association between severity of exposures during a natural disaster experienced in childhood or adolescence and posttraumatic stress symptoms, psychological distress, self-rated health, diagnosis of depression, anxiety or worry, thoughts about or attempted suicide, physical symptoms or daily functioning eight years later in young adulthood. A second aim was to compare psychological distress and self-rated health of exposed young adults with a matched population-based sample. METHOD: Young adults, who experienced the 2004 tsunami as children between 10 and 15 years of age, responded to a questionnaire eight years post disaster. The results were compared to a matched population sample. RESULTS: The results showed that the likelihood for negative psychological outcomes was higher for those who had been exposed to several types of exposures during this natural disaster. CONCLUSIONS: The negative psychological impact on children and adolescents can still be present eight years post-disaster and seems to have association with the type of exposure; loss, physical presence and subjective experience. It is important for clinicians, who meet young adults seeking help, to be conscious about the impact as long as eight years post disaster and to be aware of possible clinical implications associated with severity of exposures.
19030692<<>>Loss<<>>Development assistance for health: should policy-makers worry about its macroeconomic impact?<<>>Many low-income countries need to substantially increase expenditure to meet universal coverage goals for essential health services but, because they have very low-incomes, most will be unable to raise adequate funds exclusively from domestic sources in the short to medium term. Increased aid for health will be required. However, there has long been a concern that the rapid arrival of large amounts of foreign exchange in a country could lead to an increase in inflation and loss of international competitiveness, with an adverse impact on exports and economic growth, an economic phenomenon termed 'Dutch disease'. We review cross-country and country-level empirical studies and propose a simple framework to gauge the extent of macroeconomic risks. Of the 15 low-income countries that are increasing aid-financed health spending, 7 have high macroeconomic risks that may constrain the sustained expansion of spending. These conditions also apply in one-quarter of the 42 countries not presently increasing spending. Health authorities should be aware of the multiple risk factors at play, including factors that are health-sector specific and others that generally are not. They should also realize that there are effective means for mitigating the risk of Dutch disease associated with increasing development assistance for health. International partners also have an important role to play since more sustainable and predictable flows of donor funding will allow more productivity enhancing investment in physical and human capital, which will also contribute to ensuring there are few harmful macroeconomic effects of increases in aid.
29529930<<>>Loss<<>>Exchange over the guidewire from non-tunneled to tunneled hemodialysis catheters can be performed without patency loss.<<>>PURPOSE: The exchange from a non-tunneled hemodialysis catheter to a tunneled one over a guidewire using a previous venotomy has been reported to be safe. However, some concerns that it may increase infection risk prevent its clinical application. This approach seems particularly useful for acute kidney injury patients requiring initial renal replacement therapy, in whom we frequently worry about the choice of non-tunneled versus tunneled catheters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March 2012 to February 2016, 88 cases to receive the over-the-guidewire exchange method from a non-tunneled to a tunneled catheter and 521 cases to receive de novo tunneled catheter placement from the hemodialysis vascular access cohort were compared retrospectively. RESULTS: The immediate complication, later catheter dysfunction requiring replacement, and infection rates were comparable between the two groups. Newly placed tunneled catheter survival in the over-the-guidewire exchange group was comparable with survival in the de novo tunneled catheter group (p = 0.24). In addition, when we compared the same two methods among only intensive care unit patients; they remained similar (p = 0.19). CONCLUSION: An exchange with the over-the-guidewire method from a non-tunneled to a tunneled catheter was comparable to a de novo catheter placement technique. Therefore, this method should be viewed more favorably and should especially be considered for acute kidney injury patients.
26946678<<>>Loss<<>>Galen's Anxious Patients: Lype as Anxiety Disorder.<<>>Galen describes a syndrome he associates with an emotion called lype, with specific symptoms and a course that may lead to humoral imbalance, disease, and death. Lype is an emotion that encompasses distress at a loss, as the death of a close friend or the destruction of one's books by fire; but Galen also associates it with chronic worry about a future threat, and a physiology between the emotions of worry and fear (that is, 'anxiety'). Lype can cause a progressive syndrome characterised by insomnia, fever, pallor, and weight loss that can kill patients or degenerate into psychotic illness. This syndrome can be described in modern terms as an anxiety disorder.
18595973<<>>Loss<<>>Universal newborn hearing screening: systematic review to update the 2001 US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation.<<>>OBJECTIVE: This review is an update for the US Preventive Services Task Force on universal newborn hearing screening to detect moderate-to-severe permanent, bilateral congenital hearing loss. We focus on 3 key questions: (1) Among infants identified by universal screening who would not be identified by targeted screening, does initiating treatment before 6 months of age improve language and communication outcomes? (2) Compared with targeted screening, does universal screening increase the chance that treatment will be initiated by 6 months of age for infants at average risk or for those at high risk? (3) What are the adverse effects of screening and early treatment? METHODS: Medline and Cochrane databases were searched to identify articles published since the 2002 recommendation. Data from studies that met inclusion criteria were abstracted, and studies were rated for quality with predetermined criteria. RESULTS: A good-quality retrospective study of children with hearing loss indicates that those who had early versus late confirmation and those who had undergone universal newborn screening versus none had better receptive language at 8 years of age but not better expressive language or speech. A good-quality nonrandomized trial of a large birth cohort indicates that infants identified with hearing loss through universal newborn screening have earlier referral, diagnosis, and treatment than those not screened. These findings are corroborated by multiple descriptive studies of ages of referral, diagnosis, and treatment. Usual parental reactions to an initial nonpass on a hearing screen include worry, questioning, and distress that resolve for most parents. Cochlear implants have been associated with higher risks for bacterial meningitis in young children. CONCLUSIONS: Children with hearing loss who had universal newborn hearing screening have better language outcomes at school age than those not screened. Infants identified with hearing loss through universal screening have significantly earlier referral, diagnosis, and treatment than those identified in other ways.
28190649<<>>Loss<<>>Factors associated with deciding between risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy and ovarian cancer screening among high-risk women enrolled in GOG-0199: An NRG Oncology/Gynecologic Oncology Group study.<<>>OBJECTIVES: Women at increased genetic risk of ovarian cancer (OC) are recommended to have risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) after completion of reproductive planning. Effective screening has not been established, and novel screening modalities are being evaluated. METHODS: Participants chose either RRSO or a novel OC screening regimen (OCS) as their risk management option, and provided demographic and other data on BRCA mutation status, cancer worry, perceived intervention risks/benefits, perceived cancer risk, and quality-of-life at enrollment. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses to evaluate factors influencing decision between RRSO and OCS. RESULTS: Of 2287 participants enrolled, 904 (40%) chose RRSO and 1383 (60%) chose OCS. Compared with participants choosing OCS, participants choosing RRSO were older (p<0.0001), more likely to carry deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations (p<0.0001), perceive RRSO as effective, be more concerned about surgical harms and OCS limitations, and report higher perceived OC risk and OC-related worry. OCS participants were more likely to perceive screening as effective, be more concerned about menopausal symptoms, infertility, and loss of femininity, and report better overall quality-of-life. Twenty-four percent of participants believed they would definitely develop OC, and half estimated their lifetime OC risk as >50%, both higher than objective risk estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer worry, BRCA1/2 mutation status, and perceived intervention-related risks and benefits were associated with choosing between RRSO and OCS. Efforts to promote individualized, evidence-based, shared medical decision-making among high-risk women facing management choices should focus on conveying accurate OC risk estimates, clarifying the current understanding of intervention-related benefits and limitations, and addressing OC worry.
28478692<<>>Loss<<>>Do I really want to be going on a bloody diet? Gendered narratives in older men with painful knee osteoarthritis.<<>>PURPOSE: Small reductions in body weight can decrease osteoarthritic knee pain. Intuitively this should provide a strong incentive for weight-loss. However many people undergoing knee joint replacement (KJR) are categorised as obese. Gender theories can help us to understand differential responses to illness and therefore make an important contribution to rehabilitation. We aimed to explore barriers to weight loss in a group of older men with osteoarthritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted 12 in-depth interviews, before and 1 year after surgery, with six obese men listed for KJR. Analysis was influenced by constructivist grounded theory. We abstracted conceptual themes from the data through constant comparison. RESULTS: We identified the following themes: (1) I am big and healthy and don't need to lose weight; (2) being this size isn't good for me; (3) men don't have to worry about that sort of thing; (4) I am not as active as I used to be; (5) I have worked hard all my life; (6) what is the point in trying anyway? CONCLUSIONS: Gendered narratives can make it challenging for men to lose weight. Healthcare professionals cannot ignore the influence of gender on rehabilitation and should consider gender specific strategies. Implications for rehabilitation Men may not associate being overweight with being unhealthy. Men may take pride in being in good shape and may respond better to weight loss strategies that focus on fitness not body size. Men may link weight gain with decrease in activity levels rather than overeating. Health care professionals should challenge the assumption that weight loss will follow surgery. Health care professionals cannot ignore the influence of gender on the success of rehabilitation.
27810567<<>>Loss<<>>Development of the EORTC QLQ-CAX24, A Questionnaire for Cancer Patients With Cachexia.<<>>CONTEXT: Cachexia is commonly found in cancer patients and has profound consequences; yet there is only one questionnaire that examines the patient's perspective. OBJECTIVE: To report a rigorously developed module for patient self-reported impact of cancer cachexia. METHODS: Module development followed published guidelines. Patients from across the cancer cachexia trajectory were included. In Phase 1, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) issues were generated from a literature review and interviews with patients in four countries. The issues were revised based on patient and health care professional (HCP) input. In Phase 2, questionnaire items were formulated and translated into the languages required for Phase 3, the pilot phase, in which patients from eight countries scored the relevance and importance of each item, and provided qualitative feedback. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients and 12 HCPs took part in Phase 1. The literature review produced 68 HRQOL issues, with 22 new issues arising from the patient interviews. After patient and HCP input, 44 issues were formulated into questionnaire items in Phase 2. One hundred ten patients took part in Phase 3. One item was reworded, and 20 items were deleted as a consequence of patient feedback. CONCLUSIONS: The QLQ-CAX24 is a cancer cachexia-specific questionnaire, comprising 24 items, for HRQOL assessment in clinical trials and practice. It contains five multi-item scales (food aversion, eating and weight-loss worry, eating difficulties, loss of control, and physical decline) and four single items.
30370826<<>>Loss<<>>"Suddenly Everyone's an Expert in Our Field": Campus Victim Advocates and the Promise and Perils of Professionalization.<<>>Changes in how campuses respond to sexual assault under Title IX may dramatically alter the experiences of survivors and the roles of responders. This exploratory study examines how the roles of campus-based sexual assault victim advocates are changing and the effects on advocacy and survivors. Although most advocates agree that Title IX has increased awareness and reporting of sexual assault, they are concerned about the loss of confidential outlets for reporting, conflicts with other responders, and devaluation of their role. Some advocates see professionalization as a solution, whereas others worry that professionalization might negatively affect their ability to serve survivors.
23471505<<>>Loss<<>>Association between depression and functional vision loss in persons 20 years of age or older in the United States, NHANES 2005-2008.<<>>IMPORTANCE: This study provides further evidence from a national sample to generalize the relationship between depression and vision loss to adults across the age spectrum. Better recognition of depression among people reporting reduced ability to perform routine activities of daily living due to vision loss is warranted. OBJECTIVES: To estimate, in a national survey of US adults 20 years of age or older, the prevalence of depression among adults reporting visual function loss and among those with visual acuity impairment. The relationship between depression and vision loss has not been reported in a nationally representative sample of US adults. Previous studies have been limited to specific cohorts and predominantly focused on the older population. DESIGN: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2008. SETTING: A cross-sectional, nationally representative sample of adults, with prevalence estimates weighted to represent the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 10 480 US adults 20 years of age or older. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression, as measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale, and vision loss, as measured by visual function using a questionnaire and by visual acuity at examination. RESULTS: In 2005-2008, the estimated crude prevalence of depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire score of >/=10) was 11.3% (95% CI, 9.7%-13.2%) among adults with self-reported visual function loss and 4.8% (95% CI, 4.0%-5.7%) among adults without. The estimated prevalence of depression was 10.7% (95% CI, 8.0%-14.3%) among adults with presenting visual acuity impairment (visual acuity worse than 20/40 in the better-seeing eye) compared with 6.8% (95% CI, 5.8%-7.8%) among adults with normal visual acuity. After controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, living alone or not, education, income, employment status, health insurance, body mass index, smoking, binge drinking, general health status, eyesight worry, and major chronic conditions, self-reported visual function loss remained significantly associated with depression (overall odds ratio, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.6-2.3]), whereas the association between presenting visual acuity impairment and depression was no longer statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Self-reported visual function loss, rather than loss of visual acuity, is significantly associated with depression. Health professionals should be aware of the risk of depression among persons reporting visual function loss.
27625085<<>>Loss<<>>Comparative Study between Robotic Total Thyroidectomy with Central Lymph Node Dissection via Bilateral Axillo-breast Approach and Conventional Open Procedure for Papillary Thyroid Microcarcinoma.<<>>BACKGROUND: A large proportion of the patients with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma are young women. Therefore, minimally invasive endoscopic thyroidectomy with central neck dissection (CND) emerged and showed well-accepted results with improved cosmetic outcome, accelerated healing, and comforting the patients. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of robotic total thyroidectomy with CND via bilateral axillo-breast approach (BABA), compared with conventional open procedure in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma. METHODS: One-hundred patients with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma from March 2014 to January 2015 in Jinan Military General Hospital of People's Liberation Army (PLA) were randomly assigned to robotic group or conventional open approach group (n = 50 in each group). The total operative time, estimated intraoperative blood loss, numbers of lymph node removed, visual analog scale (VAS), postoperative hospital stay time, complications, and numerical scoring system (NSS, used to assess cosmetic effect) were analyzed. RESULTS: The robotic total thyroidectomy with CND via BABA was successfully performed in robotic group. There were no conversion from the robotic surgeries to open or endoscopic surgery. The subclinical central lymph node metastasis rate was 35%. The mean operative time of the robotic group was longer than that of the conventional open approach group (118.8 +/- 16.5 min vs. 90.7 +/- 10.3 min, P < 0.05). The study showed significant differences between the two groups in terms of the VASs (2.1 +/- 1.0 vs. 3.8 +/- 1.2, P < 0.05) and NSS (8.9 +/- 0.8 vs. 4.8 +/- 1.7, P < 0.05). The differences between the two groups in the estimated intraoperative blood loss, postoperative hospital stay time, numbers of lymph node removed, postoperative thyroglobulin levels, and complications were not statistically significant (all P > 0.05). Neither iatrogenic implantation nor metastasis occurred in punctured porous channel or chest wall in both groups. Postoperative cosmetic results were very satisfactory in the robotic group. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic total thyroidectomy with CND via BABA is safe and effective for Chinese patients with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma who worry about the neck scars.
21218348<<>>Loss<<>>Uncertainty beyond probabilities of BSE: appraisals predicting worry and coping strategies in the Canadian public.<<>>The impact of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is not limited to the infection with the BSE agent but also affects psychosocial responses, such as worry and loss of confidence in public authorities. It was shown in past crises that these reactions depended upon the way the event was perceived by the public. Understanding the nature of the perceptions of BSE is therefore of great importance for risk management in all phases of the risk, including the period before the onset of a crisis, when BSE is still only a pending threat to human health. This study analyzed data from a representative national survey of Canadians (n = 1,517) on the perceived risk of prion diseases. Factor analysis revealed emerging dimensions of BSE appraisals and regression analysis identified variables that predicted worry and coping strategies. Results yielded three significant factors, each relating differently to reactions to BSE: (1) Perceived impact, which combined perceived risk for health and likelihood of occurrence of BSE crises, was the main predictor of worry about eating tainted beef; (2) perceived mastery, consisting of personal knowledge and control, predicted taking action to avoid the disease; and (3) perceived intricacy, composed of perceived complexity and uncertainty, uniquely predicted trying to ignore BSE-related risks. Further regression analysis and analysis of variance exposed a moderating role of perceived intricacy on the relationship between perceived impact of BSE crises and worry. The implications of these findings for risk communication and management are described.
28150383<<>>Loss<<>>Evaluation of a joint adult and pediatric clinic for cancer survivorship care.<<>>OBJECTIVES: The best model of care for long-term follow-up of survivors of childhood cancer is uncertain. We describe the care experience provided by the joint adult/pediatric AfterCare Clinic at the McMaster Children's Hospital. Secondary outcomes include an evaluation of cancer worry, self-management skills, and loss to follow-up rates. METHODS: AfterCare Clinic patients aged 19-29 years were approached for study participation between January and March 2016. Data were collected from a cross-sectional survey, consisting of the Cancer Care Experience Questionnaire (CCEQ), Cancer Worry Scale (CWS), and Self-Management Skills Scale (SMSS). Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Seventy-three (40%) patients participated in the survey, 17 (23%) anonymously. Demographic characteristics of the nonanonymous participants were representative of the total clinic cohort. Most respondents were satisfied with the quality of care and anticipatory guidance provided, demonstrated by the CCEQ responses. Respondents had a high degree of cancer worries (mean score 50.6 [+/-18.4]), but good self-management skills (72.0 [+/-10.9]). Our 5-year loss to follow-up rate was 3.8%. Sensitivity analyses showed no difference in responses between the total cohort and the nonanonymous participants. CONCLUSIONS: This sample of young adult survivors of childhood cancer had a higher degree of cancer worries and higher self-management skills scores than a younger cohort of survivors of childhood cancer in the literature. Given this, along with the positive care experience reported, and the low loss to follow-up rate, the joint adult/pediatric model of survivorship care appears to be meeting the needs of this population.
30717703<<>>Loss<<>>The frequency, clinical course, and health related quality of life in adults with Gilbert's syndrome: a longitudinal study.<<>>BACKGROUND: Gilbert syndrome (GS) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of bilirubin glucuronidation which has not been investigated in Egypt. This longitudinal study investigated the frequency, clinical course, genetic profile and health related quality of life in Egyptian adults. METHODS: An initial cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the frequency of Gilbert syndrome among Egyptian adults. Subjects fulfilling the criteria of GS were enrolled into the study and prospectively followed for the clinical features, risk factors for hyperbilirubinemia, health related quality of life [Short form-36 Health Survey version 2 (SF-36v2) and Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ)], vitamins assessment and UGT1A1 polymorphisms. RESULTS: One hundred and one subjects fulfilled the criteria of GS with a prevalence of 8.016%. Recurrent jaundice was the only presentation in 47 (56.627%) GS subjects and jaundice was associated with abdominal pain, dyspepsia or loss of appetite in 54 (53.465%) subjects. A significant difference in 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 levels was detected between GS patients and control subjects (P < 00001). Twelve subjects with GS developed significant unconjugated bilirubinemia during direct antiviral therapy (DAAs) therapy for HCV despite achieving sustained virologic response. Pregnancy was associated with significant exacerbation of unconjugated bilirubin which persisted through pregnancy. Risk factors for clinical jaundice included general anesthesia, pregnancy, fasting > 12 h, pregnancy, and low calorie weight losing plans, systemic infections, and intensive physical effort. During jaundice attacks, subjects with GS had significant differences in vitality, role emotional, social functioning, worry and general health domains of the SF-36v2 and CLDQ compared to controls. The homozygous polymorphism A(TA)7TAA was the most frequent polymorphism in Egyptians with GS. CONCLUSION: Gilbert syndrome is a frequent inherited disorder in Egypt. In a substantial percentage of subjects with GS, episodes of jaundice are associated with other symptoms and nutritional deficiencies which result in impairment of HRQOL. Screening, counseling, monitoring and individualized health care are recommended for subjects with GS in the setting of anesthesia, pregnancy, treatment with DAAs, deliveries, surgery and weight loss plans.
29327220<<>>Loss<<>>Patient Perceptions and Preferences for a Mealtime Insulin Delivery Patch.<<>>INTRODUCTION: A basal-bolus insulin regimen is needed to achieve glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) below 7.0% in people with type 1 (T1D) or type 2 (T2D) diabetes who have significant loss of beta-cell function. Nonadherence to therapy is common and negatively affects the ability to reach treatment goals. We examined patient assessment of a new, wearable mealtime insulin-delivery system (patch) relative to their current mealtime insulin-delivery system (syringe, pen, or pump). The patch is designed to deliver only boluses of fast-acting insulin (no basal insulin), mechanically controlled by the patient. METHODS: Adults (n = 101) with T1D or T2D assessed their current mealtime insulin-delivery system and then assessed simulated (no active medication) patch use over a 3-day period. Participants evaluated mealtime insulin-delivery systems using eight measures from five domains (convenience, interference with daily activities, diabetes-related worry, psychological well-being, and overall satisfaction/preference) on the self-administered Insulin Delivery System Rating Questionnaire. User ratings of their current insulin-delivery systems (syringe, pen, pump) were compared with those for the patch by repeated measure analysis of variance and one-sample t tests. RESULTS: Participants had significant (p < 0.05) preference for patch over syringe in all eight comparisons, and over pen in five out of eight comparisons, with no significant preference for pen. Although there was a preference for patch over pump in six out of eight comparisons, only one showed a significant preference for patch, and one for pump. Significantly more participants reported that they would like to switch to the patch than continue using a syringe (78% vs 22%) or pen (76% vs 24%) but this difference was not significant for the group using a pump (52% vs 48%). CONCLUSIONS: Participants preferred using the patch over pens and syringes. Its ease of use and discreet method of insulin delivery may contribute to improved patient adherence to mealtime insulin regimens among people currently using injection devices.

30475459<<>>Loss<<>>Construction of Soft Base Tongs on Separator to Grasp Polysulfides from Shuttling in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries.<<>>Rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries, which use sulfur as the cathode material, promise great potentials to be the next-generation high-energy system. However, higher-order lithium polysulfides, Li2 Sx (x = 4, 6, and 8), regardless of in charge or in discharge, always form first, dissolve subsequently in the electrolyte, and shuttle to the cathode and the anode, which is called "shuttle effect." The polysulfides shuttle effect leads to heavy loss of the active-sulfur materials. Literature works mostly "cover or fill" the pores to block polysulfides from shuttling, which also hinder the lithium ion transfer. Here a protocol is invented to grasp polysulfides based on the "soft and hard acid-base" theory. Tertiary amine layer (TAL) polymerized on a polypropylene separator selectively coordinates with the dissolved high-order Li2 Sx in the cathode. Meanwhile, the transportation of lithium cations is not interrupted because of enough pores left for their transportation. After 400 cycles of charge/discharge at 0.5C, the TAL modified separator battery still possesses a capacity of 865 mAh g(-1) , which is among the best of the state-of-the-art performances of lithium-sulfur batteries. The flexible "polysulfides tongs" construction method paves a new way for Li-S batteries to reach desired performances with less worry about polysulfides shuttle.

This study explored attitudes towards leisure noise, hearing protection, and perceived susceptibility to noise damage in young adults with no diagnosed hearing problems. Understanding attitudes and behaviours will assist with the future development of strategies to improve awareness and use of hearing protection. DESIGN: A qualitative study. STUDY SAMPLE: Four focus groups, with 28 adults aged 18-35 years (6 male; 22 female; mean age 23 years). RESULTS: Using framework analysis, five themes emerged. Earplug use occurred when participants had experienced previous temporary hearing damage (i.e. short-lived tinnitus or hearing loss). Others chose not to use earplugs because music venues are expected to be loud. Peer behaviours and opinions also had a strong influence over earplug use. A lack of knowledge of hearing-related damage resulted in a lack of concern for hearing health and other health conditions taking priority. CONCLUSIONS: The challenge is to present hearing health messages that are relevant and accessible to young adults. Music and entertainment venues must also take greater responsibility to protect the hearing of its customers by at least informing visitors of the dangers of loud music.

23205237<<>>Loss<<>>What do the patients want and worry in Korean patients who undergo arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery?<<>>BACKGROUND: To specify what patients want and worry preoperatively is important in orthopedic practice. The aim of the current study was to analyze the patient characteristics of rotator cuff disease in Korean population who were willing to undergo arthroscopic surgery, and to evaluate the differences in expectations and concerns by age and gender. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 303 patients who underwent rotator cuff surgery between April 2004 and August 2008. Three questionnaires were completed before surgery: the first one addressing preoperative patient's expectation, the second one focusing on concerns by covering 64 items using a visual analogue scale, and the third one evaluating patient's demographic characteristics. The characteristics of preoperative expectation, concern, and demographic data were evaluated according to gender and age group. RESULTS: Female patients had lower level of sports activity (p = 0.007) and lower levels of information (p = 0.028). Gender specific worries are about a caregiver during hospital stay, operating on the working side, fear about ugly scars, postoperative pain, applying makeup or combing hair. The older group responded that they can't be willing to change activities of daily living (p = 0.001), are not living with a spouse (p = 0.002), had previous shoulder operation history (p = 0.008), and had a lower level of information (p = 0.007). They especially worried about medical bills, worried about the physician being too young and inexperienced, postoperative pain, loss of arm function, and hospital food. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed what Korean patients wanted and were concerned about prior to rotator cuff surgery. This can empower patients to formulate realistic expectations and make informed decisions. We feel that we can achieve higher levels of postoperative satisfaction by analyzing expectations and concerns in depth and addressing these proactively.
19841949<<>>Loss<<>>Unmet supportive needs of cancer patients in an acute care hospital in Japan--a census study.<<>>PURPOSE: Little research has been done on supportive needs of cancer patients in acute hospitals in Japan. This study aims to comprehensively assess the unmet supportive needs of hospitalized cancer patients, as well as literacy and utilization of appropriate professional care. METHODS: All cancer patients (aged 20 to 80 years) who were hospitalized in a university hospital in Tokyo during the designated 3-day period between September 1 and October 31, 2007 were recruited for participation in the study. The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory, Brief Cancer-Related Worry Inventory, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were administered. Patients' knowledge and use of relevant services were evaluated. The results were compared with those of non-cancer patients in the same treatment settings. RESULTS: A total of 125 cancer patients and 59 non-cancer patients were enrolled. Cancer patients and non-cancer patients equally suffered from physical symptoms (15-26% had severe appetite loss, 18-19% had severe dry mouth, and 16-22% had severe pain); however, psychological distress of cancer patients exceeded that of non-cancer patients (28.0% vs 8.5%; p </= 0.05). Severe psychological distress was associated with severe worry about future prospects or interpersonal and social issues and presence of two or more severe symptoms. Two thirds of the patients with severe psychological distress knew about the psychiatric division, but only one third actually sought treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Needs related to psychological issues were more prevalent among cancer patients than among non-cancer patients, despite a similar level of physical distress. Special attention should be paid to cancer patients who worry over future prospects or interpersonal and social issues, and those who have two or more severe symptoms.
30779290<<>>Loss<<>>The lived experiences of elderly dementia patients in Taiwan.<<>>The lived experiences of elderly dementia patients are affected by their cultural beliefs. This study aims to explore the lived experiences of elderly dementia patients in Taiwan in order to understand how they view their lives given the cognitive impairments that they suffer from. A descriptive phenomenological approach was undertaken in 12 elderly dementia patients who were selected using purposive sampling. Data were analysed using Colaizzi's analysis method. Five main themes emerged from the narratives: (i) distress caused by inability to remember; (ii) counteracting memory loss; (iii) worry about being a burden to family; (iv) cherishing the current situation and gaining respect; and (v) adopting a dispassionate view about life and death. The traditions of filial piety in Chinese culture were reflected in the experiences of these elderly dementia patients. Elderly dementia patients experienced inconveniences in their daily lives due to marked impairments in memory functions, and they even doubted their own independent capabilities. To counteract their disease, many elderly dementia patients developed self-contained approaches to handle their loss of memories. While they were worried about being a burden to their families, they also valued their current situation. They were comforted by being taken care of by their children, and they adopted a dispassionate view about life and death issues. For the care of elderly dementia patients, besides reducing the inconveniences brought about by cognitive impairments, there is also a need to pay attention to the deterioration of their physical bodily functions in order to intervene in their lives holistically.
27076502<<>>Loss<<>>Should we worry about the clock? Relationship between time to ICSI and reproductive outcomes in cycles with fresh and vitrified oocytes.<<>>STUDY QUESTION: Is there an optimal time to perform ICSI with respect to the times of oocyte pick-up (OPU), in order to maximize the reproductive outcomes in cycles with fresh and vitrified/warmed donor oocytes? SUMMARY ANSWER: We found no significant differences in reproductive outcomes of ICSI cycles within a wide range of times between OPU and ICSI. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In assisted reproduction, the oocyte is subject to denudation, vitrification/warming and ICSI. As shorter interaction with cumulus cells, oocyte ageing in vitro and insufficient recovery after warming may all impact the resulting embryo developmental competence, strictly controlled times between procedures are often implemented. However, most protocols have not been tested with the aim to improve reproductive results, and little information is available on the ideal times to be followed during these steps in order to optimize fertilization rates and embryo quality, and to achieve the highest pregnancy rate. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Data from 3986 ICSI cycles performed between December 2012 and May 2014 were included (3178 with fresh and 808 with vitrified/warmed donor oocytes). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: ICSI was performed using donor oocytes and either partner or donor sperm. Exact times between OPU, denudation, vitrification, warming and ICSI were recorded automatically by a radiofrequency-based system. OPU was performed strictly 36 h after GnRH agonist trigger. Biochemical pregnancy was defined as a positive serum betaHCG 15 days after transfer, clinical pregnancy was defined as a visible embryo with heartbeat 5 weeks after transfer, and ongoing pregnancy was defined as a normally developing pregnancy at 12 weeks after transfer. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Times between OPU and ICSI (OPU-ICSI) ranged from 1 h 25 min to 17 h 13 min (averagefresh +/- SD = 4 h 58 m +/- 1 h; averagevitrified= 9 h 18 m +/- 2 h). We found no effect of OPU-ICSI time on fertilization rate (pfresh=0.39; pvitrified=0.86) or embryo quality at Days 2 and 3 (pfresh=0.08; pvitrified=0.22). There was no difference in average OPU-ICSI times between positive and negative pregnancies (biochemical, clinical, ongoing and live birth rates) in either fresh (P = 0.71, 0.43, 0.79, 0.96) or vitrified (P = 0.59, 0.33, 0.73, 0.87) oocytes, respectively. Data were adjusted for oocyte donor age, semen status, number of motile spermatozoa and sperm concentration, and no effect of OPU-ICSI time on pregnancy and live birth rates for either fresh (P = 0.57, 0.16, 0.11, 0.46) or vitrified (P = 0.80, 0.73, 0.91, 0.95) oocytes was found. Further analysis for linear trend using OPU-ICSI time categorized in deciles showed that pregnancy rates and live birth rates do not increase or decrease across deciles. We found no effect of time taken for denudation to vitrification, warming to ICSI and denudation to ICSI on pregnancy rates. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This is a study with automatically collected times from a high number of ICSI cases; however, its retrospective nature cannot exclude the influence of unaccounted for variables on the results. All oocytes came from oocyte donors (</=35 years old), so results cannot be extended to older or infertile women. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results indicate that the effective window of time for insemination by ICSI might be wider than previously thought. It therefore appears that, within appropriate time frames, the management of ICSI cycles involving oocytes from young women in embryology laboratories could be adjusted to accommodate caseloads and workflow with no loss of oocyte viability or cycle efficiency.
30783313<<>>Loss<<>>Sexual Dysfunction among Men in Rural Tamil Nadu: Nature, Prevalence, Clinical Features, and Explanatory Models.<<>>Background and Aim: There is a dearth of community data on nature, prevalence, clinical features, and explanatory models related to sexual dysfunction among men, particularly from rural India. This study attempted to examine different aspects of male sexual dysfunction and misconceptions in the community. Materials and Methods: Villages in Kaniyambadi Block, Vellore district were stratified, and four were randomly selected. Men living in these villages were recruited for the study. The following instruments were administered: (i) International Index of Erectile Function, (ii) Chinese Index of Premature Ejaculation (iii) Short Explanatory Model Interview, and (iv) Revised Clinical Interview Schedule. The data were analyzed using standard bivariate and multivariate statistics. Results: A total of 211 men were recruited. The majority were middle-aged (mean 40.73 years), literate (84.8%), married, and with children (72%), from nuclear families (99.6%), followed the Hindu religion (87.7%), reported satisfaction with their marriage (51.2%), had a single sexual partner (99.5%), and practised contraception (88.2%). A minority reported erectile dysfunction (29.9%), premature ejaculation (19.4%), and depression/anxiety (30.8%). Erectile dysfunction was associated with single marital status (P < 0.001), premature ejaculation (P < 0.001), worry about nocturnal emission and loss of semen (P < 0.02), and punishment by God as causal beliefs (P < 0.001). Premature ejaculation was associated with diabetes mellitus (P < 0.05), alcohol use (P < 0.05), anxiety and depression (P < 0.01), guilt about masturbation (P < 0.001), and belief that nocturnal emission is causal (P < 0.001) and erectile dysfunction (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Sexual misconception and dysfunction in men are significant problems in rural communities in India. They mandate the need for sex education in schools and the empowerment of physicians in primary and secondary care to manage such problems.
24845781<<>>Loss<<>>Who diets? Most people and especially when they worry about food.<<>>Dieting is generally not effective in establishing weight loss and research has focused on documenting these negative consequences of dieting. Much less is known about why people diet. The present study employed a large and representative community sample to determine the demographic and psychological correlates of dieting and to examine the hypothesis that food concerns are associated with considering oneself a dieter. Participants from a community sample (n = 1113) completed an internet survey on dieting (restraint scale of the DEBQ) and its demographic and psychological correlates, with a specific focus on food concerns. In addition, they completed a 7-day snack diary to determine their food intake. According to sex-specific norm scores, 63.2% of the men and 62.7% of the women qualified as a dieter, defined as having elevated scores on the DEBQ restraint scale. Women and older people more often reported to diet, as did people with higher weights. In line with our hypothesis, food concerns (weight concerns and concerns about the diet-health link) were most strongly associated with dieting. Considering oneself as a dieter was weakly related to actual snack consumption whereas food concerns were unrelated to the consumption of snacks. Considering oneself as a dieter in terms of endorsing items on a restraint scale is an expression of food concerns that is virtually unaccompanied by changes in food intake. These findings suggest a reinterpretation of the dieting concept in terms of a strategy for coping with food concerns which need consideration in future research.
28856136<<>>Loss<<>>Impact of a Genetic Risk Score for Coronary Artery Disease on Reducing Cardiovascular Risk: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Study.<<>>PURPOSE: We tested whether providing a genetic risk score (GRS) for coronary artery disease (CAD) would serve as a motivator to improve adherence to risk-reducing strategies. METHODS: We randomized 94 participants with at least moderate risk of CAD to receive standard-of-care with (N = 49) or without (N = 45) their GRS at a subsequent 3-month follow-up visit. Our primary outcome was change in low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) between the 3- and 6-month follow-up visits (DeltaLDL-C). Secondary outcomes included other CAD risk factors, weight loss, diet, physical activity, risk perceptions, and psychological outcomes. In pre-specified analyses, we examined whether there was a greater motivational effect in participants with a higher GRS. RESULTS: Sixty-five participants completed the protocol including 30 participants in the GRS arm. We found no change in the primary outcome between participants receiving their GRS and standard-of-care participants (DeltaLDL-C: -13 vs. -9 mg/dl). Among participants with a higher GRS, we observed modest effects on weight loss and physical activity. All other secondary outcomes were not significantly different, including anxiety and worry. CONCLUSION: Adding GRS to standard-of-care did not change lipids, adherence, or psychological outcomes. Potential modest benefits in weight loss and physical activity for participants with high GRS need to be validated in larger trials.
26440384<<>>Loss<<>>Predictors of Weight Loss in Young Adults.<<>>BACKGROUND: Increased understanding of weight loss among healthy young people in naturalistic settings could inform the development of effective weight control programs. The aim of this study was to describe loss in BMI over 7 years in a population-based sample of healthy young adolescents (mean age 17 years at beginning of follow-up) and identify determinants of BMI loss. DESIGN AND METHOD: Data were available for 681 participants in the Nicotine Dependence in Teens Study (1999-2012), a longitudinal investigation of adolescents in Montreal (Canada). Loss in BMI was assessed between age 17 and 24 years. Potential predictors of BMI loss including age, sex, mother's education, worry about weight, physical activity, screen time, and cigarette smoking were studied in multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Males and females gained 2.0 and 1.4 BMI units, respectively, on average, between age 17 and 24 years. However, 9% of males and 14% of females experienced a loss in BMI >/=1.0 unit. Female sex and a higher BMI at age 17 were associated with a higher probability of BMI loss, but none of age, mother's education, physical activity, screen time, or cigarette smoking were associated with BMI loss between ages 17 and 24. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas BMI increased on average between age 17 and 24 years in a population-based sample of healthy young people, 12% of participants experienced a loss in BMI >/=1 unit. Weight loss was highest among the heaviest persons and did not affect the prevalence of underweight. No single behavior at age 17 stands out as associated with predicting BMI loss.
10661001<<>>Loss<<>>Differences and similarities between obsessive intrusive thoughts and worry in a non-clinical population: study 1.<<>>Worry is the central characteristic of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and obsessions are a central feature of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). There are strong similarities between these disorders: repetitive cognitive intrusions, negative emotions, difficulty dismissing the intrusion and finally, loss of mental control. Direct comparisons between obsessions and worries are almost non-existent in the literature but key distinctions have been proposed. The study attempted to specify the differences between obsessive intrusive thoughts and worry in a nonclinical population across a series of variables drawn from current models (appraisal, general descriptors and emotional reactions). 254 students participated in the study. They first identified an obsession-like intrusion and a worry and then evaluated them with the Cognitive Intrusion Questionnaire. Within-subject comparisons demonstrated significant differences on several variables: frequency, duration, percentage of verbal and image content, interference, egodystonic nature, stimuli awareness, emotions, etc. Most of these differences remained significant after controlling for frequency of thought. Discriminant analysis demonstrated a low classification error rate when using nine variables to categorize thoughts as obsessions or worries. Results generally support the differences postulated in the literature with the exception that obsessive intrusive thoughts are better controlled. The egodystonic/egosyntonic dimension emerged as an important variable in understanding obsessions and worry.
30046425<<>>Loss<<>>Managing a patient with globus pharyngeus.<<>>A woman aged 47 years reported the feeling of a lump in her throat for the past year. The sensation was present intermittently and usually improved when she ate. She noted it was worse with dry swallows when she felt like a tablet was stuck in her throat. The sensation had become more persistent in recent weeks leading her to worry that she had cancer. She had no cough, sore throat or hoarseness. There were no precipitating factors and no symptoms of weight loss, dysphagia, odynophagia or change in her voice. She had smoked previously and rarely had heartburn. She had no other anxieties and was not under any unusual stress. She was initially assessed by an ear, nose and throat surgeon, who found no abnormalities on examination of her neck, throat and oral cavity. Nasolaryngoscopy was normal. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was organised and reported a hiatus hernia, but a 3-month trial of a proton pump inhibitor did not have any impact on her symptoms. The benign nature of her symptoms was discussed at her gastroenterology follow-up appointment. She was discharged back to primary care with a final diagnosis of 'globus'. A trial of speech therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy or amitriptyline would be recommended if her symptoms became more troublesome in future.
21649685<<>>Loss<<>>'They say Islam has a solution for everything, so why are there no guidelines for this?' Ethical dilemmas associated with the births and deaths of infants with fatal abnormalities from a small sample of Pakistani Muslim couples in Britain.<<>>This paper presents ethical dilemmas concerning the termination of pregnancy, the management of childbirth, and the withdrawal of life-support from infants in special care, for a small sample of British Pakistani Muslim parents of babies diagnosed with fatal abnormalities. Case studies illustrating these dilemmas are taken from a qualitative study of 66 families of Pakistani origin referred to a genetics clinic in Southern England. The paper shows how parents negotiated between the authoritative knowledge of their doctors, religious experts, and senior family members in response to the ethical dilemmas they faced. There was little knowledge or open discussion of the view that Islam permits the termination of pregnancy for serious or fatal abnormality within 120 days and there was considerable disquiet over the idea of ending a pregnancy. For some parents, whether their newborn baby would draw breath was a main worry, with implications for the baby's Muslim identity and for the recognition of loss the parents would receive from family and community. This concern sometimes conflicted with doctors' concerns to minimize risk to future pregnancies by not performing a Caesarean delivery if a baby is sure to die. The paper also identifies parents' concerns and feelings of wrong-doing regarding the withdrawal of artificial life-support from infants with multiple abnormalities. The conclusion considers some of the implications of these observations for the counselling and support of Muslim parents following the pre- or neo-natal diagnosis of fatal abnormalities in their children.
27539501<<>>Loss<<>>What does the literature say about the needs of veterans in the areas of health?<<>>This paper reports on a systematic review undertaken in 2013 aimed at identifying evidence and dismissing some of the myths surrounding the needs of the veteran community. Papers were retrieved from a wide range of sources to ensure that literature covered the key areas of health concerns and focused also on time spent in service. Of the twenty eight papers reviewed categories relating to mental health (including PTSD and suicide), the use of alcohol, trauma, hearing loss, cancer and obesity were identified. Outcomes from the review established that while early service leavers were the most vulnerable there were also aspects within service that had an impact on future life events such as the type of leadership experienced, the cohesion of the unit and facing combat situations. The use of alcohol as a coping mechanism is also considered prevalent with adverse effects as is the worry of family situations at home. The impact of service life on the veteran, especially if suffering trauma will have long lasting psychological and physical outcomes, although it is recognised that veterans in the main have excellent physical and psychological strength and many physical illnesses are not greatly exaggerated from that of the general public.
27031318<<>>Loss<<>>Amenorrhea in the Female Athlete: What to Do and When to Worry.<<>>Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea is a diagnosis of exclusion that is common in female athletes, particularly those participating in aesthetic sports (ballet, other dance genres, figure skating, and gymnastics) and endurance sports (cross-country running). Although common, it should be considered abnormal even in the high-level elite athlete. Amenorrhea in combination with low energy availability and low bone density is labeled "the Female Athlete Triad." Studies have demonstrated numerous long-term consequences of athletes suffering from all or a portion of this triad, including increased rate of musculoskeletal injuries, stress fractures, abnormal lipid profiles, endothelial dysfunction, potential irreversible bone loss, depression, anxiety, low self- esteem, and increased mortality. This article provides the clinician with the tools to evaluate an athlete with secondary amenorrhea, reviews the recommended treatment options for affected athletes, and discusses when to return to the activity in an effort to facilitate "healthy" participation.
25892060<<>>Loss<<>>Comparison of quality of life and worry of cancer recurrence between endoscopic and surgical treatment for early gastric cancer.<<>>BACKGROUND: The quality of life (QOL) of patients who survive early gastric cancer (EGC) is an area of increasing interest. OBJECTIVE: To compare the QOL and degree of worry of cancer recurrence in EGC patients who underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) or surgery. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTINGS: A tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: A total of 565 patients with EGC who received ESD or surgery. INTERVENTION: Questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: QOL was evaluated using the Short-form Health Survey and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QOL questionnaires (QLQ-C30 and EORTC-QLQ-STO22). Mood disorders and the worry of cancer recurrence were estimated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Worry of Cancer Scale, respectively. RESULTS: Questionnaires were completed by 55.7% of the ESD (137/246) and 58.9% of the surgery (188/319) patients. The surgery group had more QOL-related symptomatic and functional problems, including fatigue (P=.044), nausea/vomiting (P=.032), appetite loss (P=.023), diarrhea (P<.001), pain (P=.013), reflux symptoms (P=.005), eating restrictions (P<.001), anxiety (P=.015), taste impairment (P=.011), and poor body image (P<.001). The ESD group had significantly higher worry of cancer recurrence scores after adjusting for covariates, especially when visiting their physicians. The HADS results did not differ between the groups. LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional design. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic treatment for EGC provides a better QOL, but stomach preservation might provoke cancer recurrence worries. Endoscopists should address this issue for relieving a patient's concern of cancer recurrence during follow-up period after ESD. ( CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: WHO ICTRP KCT0000791.).
24918824<<>>Loss<<>>Risk factors for delay in symptomatic presentation: a survey of cancer patients.<<>>BACKGROUND: Delay in symptomatic presentation leading to advanced stage at diagnosis may contribute to poor cancer survival. To inform public health approaches to promoting early symptomatic presentation, we aimed to identify risk factors for delay in presentation across several cancers. METHODS: We surveyed 2371 patients with 15 cancers about nature and duration of symptoms using a postal questionnaire. We calculated relative risks for delay in presentation (time from symptom onset to first presentation >3 months) by cancer, symptoms leading to diagnosis and reasons for putting off going to the doctor, controlling for age, sex and deprivation group. RESULTS: Among 1999 cancer patients reporting symptoms, 21% delayed presentation for >3 months. Delay was associated with greater socioeconomic deprivation but not age or sex. Patients with prostate (44%) and rectal cancer (37%) were most likely to delay and patients with breast cancer least likely to delay (8%). Urinary difficulties, change of bowel habit, systemic symptoms (fatigue, weight loss and loss of appetite) and skin symptoms were all common and associated with delay. Overall, patients with bleeding symptoms were no more likely to delay presentation than patients who did not have bleeding symptoms. However, within the group of patients with bleeding symptoms, there were significant differences in risk of delay by source of bleeding: 35% of patients with rectal bleeding delayed presentation, but only 9% of patients with urinary bleeding. A lump was a common symptom but not associated with delay in presentation. Twenty-eight percent had not recognised their symptoms as serious and this was associated with a doubling in risk of delay. Embarrassment, worry about what the doctor might find, being too busy to go to the doctor and worry about wasting the doctor's time were also strong risk factors for delay, but were much less commonly reported (<6%). INTERPRETATION: Approaches to promote early presentation should aim to increase awareness of the significance of cancer symptoms and should be designed to work for people of the lowest socioeconomic status. In particular, awareness that rectal bleeding is a possible symptom of cancer should be raised.
19893869<<>>Loss<<>>[Body weight perception and dieting behaviour in Spanish population].<<>>INTRODUCTION: A high percentage of the population initiate or keep diets to lose weight independently of suffering or not overweight/obesity. Nevertheless, exists a great unknowledge on the more convenient guidelines to achieve this aim. OBJECTIVE: To analyze weight perception and types of behavior to control the corporal weight in Spanish adults in order to be able to start the campaigns most adapted to provide a correct nutritional information to the population. METHODS: 2,168 subjects (18 +/- 50 years) of 5 Spanish provinces were studied. Anthropometric and information about the worry about corporal weight data was obtained. RESULTS: 65.6% of subjects declare a desire to lose weight and 44.9% have followed diets with this purpose in some moment (especially in female population). 63.9% of subjects increase physical activity to control weight, 23.9% consumes dietetic products or medicinal herbs and 48.0% compensate the excesses when they try to lose weight. Sweets (24.5%), fats (15.4%), pastries (11.4%) and bread (11.4%) are avoided and fruits and vegetables consumption is increased (specially by women) when try to lose weight. CONCLUSIONS: Weight loss practices use to be inadequate due to the desire to lose weight quickly and to the unknowledge about the most adecuate diet to achieve this aim. It is necessary to avoid this type of practices and to improve the knowledge on nutrition in the population.
24064686<<>>Loss<<>>Acute severe hypercalcemia after traumatic fractures and immobilization in hypophosphatasia complicated by chronic renal failure.<<>>CONTEXT: Hypophosphatasia (HPP) features deficient activity of the "tissue-nonspecific" isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) due to loss-of-function mutation(s) within the TNSALP gene. Consequently, inorganic pyrophosphate, a TNSALP substrate and inhibitor of mineralization, accumulates extracellularly. This can cause rickets or osteomalacia. OBJECTIVE: We report a 55-year-old man with HPP and chronic renal failure (CRF) requiring hemodialysis who developed severe hypercalcemia acutely after traumatic fractures and immobilization. He manifested HPP in childhood and in middle age received hemodialysis for CRF attributed to hypertension and anti-inflammatory medication. He took 2 g of calcium carbonate orally each day to bind dietary phosphorus, but never aluminum hydroxide or any form of vitamin D. Pretrauma serum levels of calcium spanned 8.4-10.7 mg/dL (normal [Nl], 8.6-10.3), inorganic phosphate 5.8-6.4 mg/dL (Nl, 2.5-4.5), and PTH 63-75 pg/mL (Nl, 10-55). RESULTS: Rapid succession falls fractured multiple major bones. Six hours later, he became confused. Serum calcium was 14.9 mg/dL, ionized calcium was 7.4 mg/dL (Nl, 4.5-5.1), and PTH was 16 pg/mL. Hemodialysis quickly corrected his hypercalcemia and confusion. Low serum alkaline phosphatase persisted, and follow-up skeletal histopathology showed that his osteomalacia was severe. CONCLUSION: Hemodialysis does not heal the skeletal disease of HPP. During sudden fracture immobilization in HPP, sufficient calcium can emerge from bone, perhaps from a rapidly exchangeable calcium pool, to cause acute severe hypercalcemia if the kidneys cannot compensate for the mineral efflux. Hence, we worry that acute hypercalcemia might accompany sudden immobilization in CRF patients without HPP if they have adynamic bone disease.
27919389<<>>Loss<<>>Older patients' use of technology for a post-discharge nutritional intervention - A mixed-methods feasibility study.<<>>BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is frequent in older people and a precursor for morbidity and hospitalisation; furthermore low intake and weight loss during and after hospitalisation is well-described. Such patients are often excluded from technology projects on account of lack of skills. This is a barrier for their access to many current and future health care offers. OBJECTIVES: To test the acceptability, feasibility and preliminary efficacy of technology-supported energy- and protein-enforced homedelivered meals for older patients discharged from hospital. DESIGN: Mixed method design including a quasi-experimental controlled feasibility trial and embedded qualitative interviews. PARTICIPANTS: Older medical patients (mean age 79.4 years; women 66.7%) at nutritional risk and discharged to own home were included consecutively to first the control group (n=18) and later the intervention group (n=18). Nine intervention and 16 control group patients completed the project. METHODS: Intervention: group received: 1) enriched meals delivered to participants' homes 12 weeks after discharge, and 2) a tablet computer combining goal setting for intake with self-monitoring and feedback. Control group were treated as usual. Data collection was done at baseline, and at six and 12 weeks follow-up. Feasibility evaluation focused on 1) inclusion and retention and 2) acceptability and functionality of the intervention. Efficacy primary endpoint: Muscle strength and BMI. Secondary: Health related quality of life (HRQoL), depression; readmissions, mortality. RESULTS: Technology challenges were related to immaturity of the out-of hospital app version; however, participants were motivated and capable of using the device. Inclusion and retention was challenged by the acceptability of the nutritional intervention and exhaustion among patients. Mortality was high. Although weaker at baseline the intervention group increased their muscle strength more consistently than did the control group: Handgrip strength with 2.5kg vs 0.9kg and chairto-stand-test with 3.3 vs. 1.8 times. They also improved their depression score and HRQoL more, and patients reported increased intake, appetite, and energy in the interviews. Relatives confirmed this and also reported positive impact on their level of worry and on the relationship with the older person. CONCLUSION: The study provided valuable insight into appropriate methods and procedures as well as older people's preferences and views on barriers to successful intervention and use of technology in health care. This will guide the design of a future sufficiently powered study. Effect evaluation provided guidance for future sample size calculation.
24272197<<>>Loss<<>>Therapy in endocrine disease: treatment of hirsutism in the polycystic ovary syndrome.<<>>Hirsutism is a common medical complaint among women of reproductive age, and it affects the majority of women with the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Increased rate of androgen production and its availability in tissue represent the main pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for hirsutism. In addition, androgens may be generated de novo in the hair follicle; therefore, circulating androgen levels do not quantify the real exposure of the hair follicle to androgens, as a quota is locally generated. Hirsutism is a clinical sign and not a disease in itself; its presence does not therefore necessarily require treatment, particularly in mild-to-moderate forms, and when an affected woman does not worry about it. Physicians should decide whether hirsutism is to be treated or not by evaluating not only the severity of the phenomenon but also the subjective perception of the patient, which does not necessarily correspond to the true extent of hair growth. In any case, a physician should manage a woman with hirsutism only on the basis of a diagnosis of the underlying cause, and after a clear explanation of the efficacy of each therapeutic choice. Cosmetic procedures and pharmacological intervention are commonly used in the treatment of hirsutism and are discussed in this paper. Importantly, there are different phenotypes of women with hirsutism and PCOS that may require specific attention in the choice of treatment. In particular, when obesity is present, lifestyle intervention should be always considered, and if necessary combined with pharmacotherapy.
19862680<<>>Loss<<>>Psychosocial adjustment of siblings of children with cancer: a systematic review.<<>>OBJECTIVES: To promote a broader understanding of the psychosocial impact of childhood cancer on siblings, a systematic review was undertaken. Directions for future research are proposed and clinical strategies are suggested for addressing the needs of these children. METHODS: Searches of Medline, PsycINFO and CINAHL revealed 65 relevant qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods' papers published between 1997 and 2008. These papers were rated for scientific merit and findings were extracted for summary. RESULTS: Siblings of children with cancer do not experience elevated mean rates of psychiatric disorders, but a significant subset experiences post-traumatic stress symptoms, negative emotional reactions (e.g. shock, fear, worry, sadness, helplessness, anger, and guilt), and poor quality of life in emotional, family, and social domains. In general, distress is greater closer to time of diagnosis. School difficulties are also evident within 2 years of diagnosis. Qualitative studies reveal family-level themes such as loss of attention and status as well as positive outcomes including increased sibling maturity and empathy. CONCLUSIONS: Research regarding siblings of children with cancer continues to be methodologically limited. The conclusions of qualitative and quantitative studies differ considerably. We propose a research agenda to propel this field forward including greater attention to alterations in normative development (as opposed to psychiatric conditions), development of more appropriate quantitative measures, examination of potential moderators of adaptation, and use of prospective longitudinal designs. Siblings of children with cancer are a psychosocially at-risk group and should be provided with appropriate supportive services.
22427954<<>>Loss<<>>The personal and health service impact of falls in 85 year olds: cross-sectional findings from the Newcastle 85+ cohort study.<<>>INTRODUCTION: Falls are common in older people and increase in prevalence with advancing old age. There is limited knowledge about their impact in those aged 85 years and older, the fastest growing age group of the population. We investigated the prevalence and impact of falls, and the overlap between falls, dizziness and blackouts, in a population-based sample of 85 year olds. METHODS: DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from Newcastle 85+ Cohort Study. SETTING: Primary care, North-East England. PARTICIPANTS: 816 men and women aged 85 years. MEASUREMENTS: Structured interview with research nurse. Cost-consequence analysis of fall-related healthcare costs. RESULTS: Over 38% (313/816) of participants had fallen at least once in the previous 12 months and of these: 10.6% (33/312) sustained a fracture, 30.1% (94/312) attended an emergency department, and 12.8% (40/312) were admitted to hospital. Only 37.2% (115/309) of fallers had specifically discussed their falls problem with their general practitioner and only 12.7% (39/308) had seen a falls specialist. The average annual healthcare cost per faller was estimated at pound202 (inter-quartile range pound174- pound231) or US$329 ($284-$377). 'Worry about falling' was experienced by 42.0% (128/305) of fallers, 'loss of confidence' by 40.0% (122/305), and 'going out less often' by 25.9% (79/305); each was significantly more common in women, odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for women: men of 2.63 (1.45-4.55), 4.00 (2.27-7.14), and 2.86 (1.54-5.56) respectively. Dizziness and blackouts were reported by 40.0% (318/796) and 6.4% (52/808) of participants respectively. There was marked overlap in the report of falls, dizziness and blackouts. CONCLUSIONS: Falls in 85 year olds are very common, associated with considerable psychological and physical morbidity, and have high impact on healthcare services. Wider use of fall prevention services is needed. Significant expansion in acute and preventative services is required in view of the rapid growth in this age group.
22754284<<>>Loss<<>>Grief and mourning gone awry: pathway and course of complicated grief.<<>>Complicated grief is a recently recognized condition that occurs in about 7% of bereaved people. People with this condition are caught up in rumination about the circumstances of the death, worry about its consequences, or excessive avoidance of reminders of the loss. Unable to comprehend the finality and consequences of the loss, they resort to excessive avoidance of reminders of the loss as they are tossed helplessly on waves of intense emotion. People with complicated grief need help, and clinicians need to know how to recognize the symptoms and how to provide help. This paper provides a framework to help clinicans understand bereavement, grief, and mourning. Evidence-based diagnostic criteria are provided to help clinicians recognize complicated grief, and differentiate it from depression as well as anxiety disorder. We provide an overview of risk factors and basic assumptions and principles that can guide treatment.
22265225<<>>Loss<<>>A history of mental health problems may predict maternal distress in women postpartum.<<>>AIM: to elucidate the effects of prior mental disorders on newly delivered women's mental health and to compare the outcome of different instruments to screen for maternal distress and depression after childbirth. The sample of 232 Stockholm women responded to a questionnaire on background data and three questionnaires, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Postpartum Depression Symptoms Rating Scale (PPDS) at 4-6 weeks and 10-12 weeks after childbirth. RESULTS: show that maternal distress was experienced by 20% of the women as assessed by the BDI and the EPDS at 4-6 weeks postpartum, and by 13-16% of the women at 10-12 weeks after childbirth. A regression analysis showed that a history of mental health problems influenced maternal self-assessment at both points-in-time. The following background data showed a small but significant impact on maternal self-assessment; younger age, lower educational level, and a short-term partner relationship. The most important emotional responses were sadness, guilt and self-blame across all three instruments at both points in time. Loss of pleasure, self-accusations, irritability, anger, worry and somatic symptoms such as muscular tension, headaches and stomach cramps also occurred. CONCLUSION: women with prior mental health problems are more vulnerable for maternal distress and midwives at the antenatal health clinics should encourage pregnant women to express emotional issues during their transition to motherhood in order to offer appropriate professional support and care.
28220089<<>>Loss<<>>Emotion Regulation Therapy: A Mechanism-Targeted Treatment for Disorders of Distress.<<>>"Distress disorders," which include generalized anxiety disorder and major depression are often highly comorbid with each other and appear to be characterized by common temperamental features that reflect heightened sensitivity to underlying motivational systems related to threat/safety and reward/loss. Further, individuals with distress disorders tend to utilize self-referential processes (e.g., worry, rumination, self-criticism) in a maladaptive attempt to respond to motivationally relevant distress, often resulting in suboptimal contextual learning. Despite the success of cognitive behavioral therapies for emotional disorders, a sizable subgroup of patients with distress disorders fail to evidence adequate treatment response. Emotion Regulation Therapy (ERT) is a theoretically derived, evidence based, treatment that integrates principles (e.g., skills training, exposure) from traditional and contemporary therapies with findings from basic and translational affective science to offer a framework for improving intervention by focusing on the motivational responses and corresponding regulatory characteristics of individuals with high levels of chronic distress. Open and randomized controlled trials have demonstrated preliminary support for the utility of ERT as reflected by strong effect sizes comparable to and exceeding established intervention approaches. In addition, pilot findings support the role of underlying proposed mechanisms in this efficacious response. This article presents the functional model associated with ERT and describes the proposed mechanisms of the treatment. Additionally, a clinical case is presented, allowing the reader to gain a greater applied understanding of the different components of the ERT model and treatment.
22083180<<>>Loss<<>>[Risk management in ambulatory anti-cancer therapy, focusing on nausea and vomiting].<<>>Patients who receive ambulatory-based chemotherapy worry about nausea and vomiting leading to appetite loss, decreased activity, and finally, the lowering of QOL. The management of nausea and vomiting also prevents decreased body weight loss, encourages compliance with chemotherapy treatments, and promotes social activity. Recently, NCCN, ASCO, MASCC as well as JSCO guideline for antiemesis were updated and approved for delayed antiemetic drugs in Japan. According to these guidelines, we should administer antiemetic drugs appropriately to prevent anticipatory emesis. Last year, in a retrospective analysis of head and neck cancer, in a comparison of before and after the use of aprepitant, the use can improved the dose intensity of CDDP and one-year survival after chemotherapy. We need to have prospective analyses, but appropriate use of antiemetic drugs and management of chemotherapy lead to a better clinical outcome and safety.
21522060<<>>Loss<<>>Determinants of altered life perspectives among older-adult long-term cancer survivors.<<>>BACKGROUND: In the recent literature on cancer survivorship, positive changes are emphasized in the aftermath of trauma. However, there is insufficient research on older-adult survivors and more complex transformations. OBJECTIVE: Consistent with nursing researchers' views about the duality of cancer survivor experiences, this research examined both positive and negative posttraumatic transformations (PTTs) among long-term survivors. Demographic, stress, and appraisal-related predictors of transformations were considered. METHODS: Using cross-sectional survey design, interviews were conducted with 288 survivors of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer. The sample, obtained from a hospital tumor registry, was 58% female, 33% African American, and 67% white (mean age, 72.5 [SD, 7.6] years). Demographic characteristics, cumulative stress exposure, appraisals of stress, and self-reported PTTs were measured. RESULTS: Most respondents reported diverse transformations attributed to their illness experience. Demographic characteristics and stress appraisals were more strongly associated with PTT outcomes than was cumulative stress exposure. Appraisals of the cancer experience as stressful, as generating worry, and as stigmatizing were significantly associated with diverse PTT outcomes. CONCLUSION: Many long-term older cancer survivors report PTT reflecting altered perspectives on life. Posttraumatic transformations are related to the view that cancer is a continuing worrisome and stigmatizing experience. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurses have a unique opportunity to discuss with patients the potentially life-changing nature of the cancer experience in a manner that allows for understanding and acceptance of complex changes, incorporating benefit finding along with acknowledgement of loss and suffering. This type of discussion can enhance cancer survivors' mental health.
21986193<<>>Loss<<>>Comparison of a sleep item from the General Health Questionnaire-12 with the Jenkins Sleep Questionnaire as measures of sleep disturbance.<<>>BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to examine whether a widely available single-item measure of sleep disturbances is an acceptable alternative to a multi-item sleep questionnaire. METHODS: Data were derived from Finnish Helsinki Health Study postal questionnaires administered in 2000-2002 (n = 7777, response rate 67%). The measures were the 4-item Jenkins Sleep Questionnaire (JSQ) on difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep, and nonrestorative sleep, and an item on sleep loss due to worry, from the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analyses were done to compare the predictive performance of the GHQ-12 item with the JSQ scale. Using the above 2 measures of sleep, logistic regression models were used to examine associations between sociodemographic factors, working conditions, health-related factors, and sleep disturbance. RESULTS: The estimated area under the ROC curve was 0.68 among both women and men, which suggests that the ability of the GHQ-12 item to discriminate true positives from false positives was modest. However, the associations of sleep disturbance with its key determinants were largely similar using the GHQ-12 and the JSQ. CONCLUSIONS: A widely available, GHQ-12-based, single-item sleep measure was not an adequate substitute for a multi-item measure of overall sleep disturbance. Although the measures produced largely similar associations for key determinants of poor sleep, the discrepancies between responses must be considered when analyzing data from a measure that uses a single sleep item.
27000795<<>>Loss<<>>A cross-sectional study of parental awareness of and reasons for lack of health insurance among minority children, and the impact on health, access to care, and unmet needs.<<>>BACKGROUND: Minority children have the highest US uninsurance rates; Latino and African-American children account for 53 % of uninsured American children, despite comprising only 48 % of the total US child population. The study aim was to examine parental awareness of and the reasons for lacking health insurance in Medicaid/CHIP-eligible minority children, and the impact of the children's uninsurance on health, access to care, unmet needs, and family financial burden. METHODS: For this cross-sectional study, a consecutive series of uninsured, Medicaid/CHIP-eligible Latino and African-American children was recruited at 97 urban Texas community sites, including supermarkets, health fairs, and schools. Measures/outcomes were assessed using validated instruments, and included sociodemographic characteristics, uninsurance duration, reasons for the child being uninsured, health status, special healthcare needs, access to medical and dental care, unmet needs, use of health services, quality of care, satisfaction with care, out-of-pocket costs of care, and financial burden. RESULTS: The mean time uninsured for the 267 participants was 14 months; 5 % had never been insured. The most common reason for insurance loss was expired and never reapplied (30 %), and for never being insured, high insurance costs. Only 49 % of parents were aware that their uninsured child was Medicaid/CHIP eligible. Thirty-eight percent of children had suboptimal health, and 2/3 had special healthcare needs, but 64 % have no primary-care provider; 83 % of parents worry about their child's health more than others. Unmet healthcare needs include: healthcare, 73 %; mental healthcare, 70 %; mobility aids/devices, 67 %; dental, 61 %; specialty care, 57 %; and vision, 46 %. Due to the child's health, 35 % of parents had financial problems, 23 % cut work hours, and 10 % ceased work. Higher proportions of Latinos lack primary-care providers, and higher proportions of African-Americans experience family financial burden. CONCLUSIONS: Half of parents of uninsured minority children are unaware that their children are Medicaid/CHIP-eligible. These uninsured children have suboptimal health, impaired access to care, and major unmet needs. The child's health causes considerable family financial burden, and one in 10 parents ceased work. The study findings indicate urgent needs for better parental education about Medicaid/CHIP, and for improved Medicaid/CHIP outreach and enrollment.
24020426<<>>Loss<<>>"It gave me something big in my life to wonder and think about which took over the space ... and not MS": managing well-being in multiple sclerosis through art-making.<<>>BACKGROUND AND AIM: Individuals living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) often face progressive loss of function, uncertainty and disruption to self-image and valued roles. Previous studies show that creative self-expression is valued by some people living with long-term illness, yet its meaning for people living with MS is unclear. This research study explored the meanings of leisure-based visual art-making for people living with MS. METHOD: This qualitative study followed guidelines for Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Single semi-structured interviews were conducted with five adults (2 males; 3 females; 40-65 years), recruited from MS Ireland. FINDINGS: Participants valued art-making for contributing to a more satisfying way of life; for filling occupational voids and using time well. Deep immersion offered respite from worry about illness. Creative classes offered social camaraderie and opportunities for learning and development. Art-making processes and products were highly affirmative, increasing emotional well-being and promoting self-worth. Most felt that they expressed valued aspects of self through their art. Art-making appeared to assist with identity maintenance, accommodating functional losses associated with MS whilst opening "new doors". CONCLUSION: Art-making offered a multi-faceted means of supporting identity and increasing fulfilment in lives that were restricted in many ways by MS.
17147098<<>>Loss<<>>The role of meta-cognitions and thought control techniques in predisposition to auditory and visual hallucinations.<<>>OBJECTIVES: This study examines the relationship between a predisposition to hallucinations and meta-cognitive variables and thought-control techniques, controlling for the possible effect of anxiety. In order to do so, we start out with the hypothesis that anxiety does not, in itself, explain the association between meta-cognitions and a predisposition to auditory and visual hallucinations. DESIGN: A within-participants correlational design was employed. METHODS: Four psychometric tests relating to predisposition to hallucinations, anxiety, meta-cognitions and thought-control techniques were administered to 150 participants. RESULTS: It was found that, after controlling for participants' anxiety levels, the 'loss of cognitive confidence' factor predicted the score on the scale of predisposition to both auditory and visual hallucinations. Thought-control strategies based on worry were also found to be predictive of a greater predisposition to hallucinations, regardless of whether or not participants' anxiety level was controlled. CONCLUSIONS: Meta-cognitive variables of cognitive confidence and thought control through worry are positively associated with a predisposition to hallucinations. LIMITATIONS: The correlational nature of the design does not allow inferences about causal relationships.
18831309<<>>Loss<<>>Maternal distress and women's reentry into family and community life.<<>>This paper advances conceptualization of maternal distress following incarceration. We utilized a multiple case study methodology based on interviews with 10 mothers who demonstrated various permutations of "the triple threat" (depression, domestic violence, and substance abuse; Arditti & Few, 2006). Findings suggest that depressive symptomology persisted and worsened for mothers in our study and that maternal distress was indicative not only of women's psychological state, but also a relational and situational construct that embodied women's core experience. Maternal distress was largely characterized by health challenges, dysfunctional intimate relationships, loss related trauma, guilt and worry over children, and economic inadequacy. Further, maternal distress seemed to be intensified by the punitive traumatic context of prison and lessened by rehabilitation opportunities as well as support by kin and probation officers after reentry. Recommendations for clinicians and professionals who work with reentry mothers center around the need to alleviate maternal distress and better address women's emotional and physical health needs during incarceration and reentry.
27199271<<>>Loss<<>>Child's symptom burden and depressive symptoms among caregivers of children with cancers: an argument for early integration of pediatric palliative care.<<>>BACKGROUND: Childhood cancers evoke various emotional reactions in caregivers which can impair their well-being and roles. Little is known about caregiving and which cancer-associated factors are related to caregiver's depression in resource-restricted settings. We sought to investigate if child's symptom burden is related to depressive symptoms in caregivers. METHODS: Seventy-two caregivers and children with cancers were administered questionnaires to elicit socio-demographic and disease-related data. Subsequently, the child's symptoms were profiled with Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS 7-12); while screening for depressive symptoms in caregivers was done using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised (CES-DR). RESULTS: All the caregivers were parents, and largely mothers (83.7%). The mean ages of caregivers and children were 39+/-2 and 10+/-2 years respectively. Majority of caregivers (90.3%) were either ignorant or attributed spiritual causation to the cancers. The common symptoms with prevalence >50% in the children included pain, nausea, worry, and lack of energy (LE); symptoms' prevalence ranged from LE (68%) to itching (32%). Approximately, one-third each of the children reported hair and weight loss which were considered 'unusual' in the design of MSAS 7-12. The symptoms showed variability in distress, frequency and intensity. In particular, pain, lack of appetite (LA) and feeling sad (FS) were reported as most burdensome in >50% of the children. More than one-third of caregivers (38.2%) screened positive for significant depressive symptoms. The global symptom burden (r=0.58) and individual symptom correlated positively with depressive symptoms in caregivers (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the need for improved awareness creation on childhood cancers to obviate late presentations and poor access to care. Again, early integration of pediatric palliative care in childhood cancer care to ensure symptom management as well as its extended benefits on caregivers' wellbeing is desirable. The pattern of certain "unusual" symptoms in children with cancer in our work suggests the need to put into consideration 'novel' symptoms which were not captured in existing instruments. Future research on supportive care in pediatric cancers is indicated.
20077992<<>>Loss<<>>Improving caregivers' well-being by using technology to manage nighttime activity in persons with dementia.<<>>This article reports the qualitative arm of a mixed-methods study designed to test an in-home nighttime monitoring system (NMS) that tracks the nighttime activity of persons with dementia. Fourteen caregiver interviews were analyzed using grounded theory/full conceptual description methods to determine the issues associated with providing care at night and to explore the benefits of using the NMS. Caregivers not using the NMS experienced sleep disruption, overwhelming worry, and loss of personal space, leading to decreased energy and changes in mood. When the NMS was used, caregivers reported improved "peace of mind." The fear and uncertainty associated with worry was alleviated by reliable alerts regarding the whereabouts of the person with dementia. Some caregivers were able to better balance needs for personal space with needs to remain in contact with the person with dementia. Generally, caregivers reported improved quality of sleep, although some caregivers reported more awakenings due to the system alerts.
19425317<<>>Loss<<>>The 2009 Retirement Confidence Survey: economy drives confidence to record lows; many looking to work longer.<<>>RECORD LOW CONFIDENCE LEVELS: Workers who say they are very confident about having enough money for a comfortable retirement this year hit the lowest level in 2009 (13 percent) since the Retirement Confidence Survey started asking the question in 1993, continuing a two-year decline. Retirees also posted a new low in confidence about having a financially secure retirement, with only 20 percent now saying they are very confident (down from 41 percent in 2007). THE ECONOMY, INFLATION, COST OF LIVING ARE THE BIG CONCERNS: Not surprisingly, workers overall who have lost confidence over the past year about affording a comfortable retirement most often cite the recent economic uncertainty, inflation, and the cost of living as primary factors. In addition, certain negative experiences, such as job loss or a pay cut, loss of retirement savings, or an increase in debt, almost always contribute to loss of confidence among those who experience them. RETIREMENT EXPECTATIONS DELAYED: Workers apparently expect to work longer because of the economic downturn: 28 percent of workers in the 2009 RCS say the age at which they expect to retire has changed in the past year. Of those, the vast majority (89 percent) say that they have postponed retirement with the intention of increasing their financial security. Nevertheless, the median (mid-point) worker expects to retire at age 65, with 21 percent planning to push on into their 70s. The median retiree actually retired at age 62, and 47 percent of retirees say they retired sooner than planned. WORKING IN RETIREMENT: More workers are also planning to supplement their income in retirement by working for pay. The percentage of workers planning to work after they retire has increased to 72 percent in 2009 (up from 66 percent in 2007). This compares with 34 percent of retirees who report they actually worked for pay at some time during their retirement. GREATER WORRY ABOUT BASIC AND HEALTH EXPENSES: Workers who say they very confident in having enough money to take care of basic expenses in retirement dropped to 25 percent in 2009 (down from 40 percent in 2007), while only 13 percent feel very confident about having enough to pay for medical expenses (down from 20 percent in 2007. Among retirees, only a quarter (25 percent, down from 41 percent in 2007) feel very confident about covering their health expenses. HOW WORKERS ARE RESPONDING: Among workers who have lost confidence in their ability to secure a comfortable retirement, most (81 percent) say they have reduced their expenses, while others are changing the way they invest their money (43 percent), working more hours or a second job (38 percent), saving more money (25 percent), and seeking advice from a financial professional (25 percent). Among all workers, 75 percent say they and/or their spouse have saved money for retirement, one of the highest levels ever measured by the RCS. IGNORANCE STILL A MAJOR FACTOR: Many workers still do not have a good idea of how much they need to save for retirement. Only 44 percent of workers report they and/or their spouse have tried to calculate how much money they will need to have saved by the time they retire--and an equal proportion (44 percent) simply guess at how much they will need for a comfortable retirement.
16569301<<>>Loss<<>>Maternal anxiety following newborn hearing screening: the moderating role of knowledge.<<>>OBJECTIVES: To describe the impact upon maternal anxiety of newborn hearing screening and examine the Possible moderating role of knowledge. METHODS: Questionnaires assessing maternal state anxiety, worry and certainty about the baby's hearing, and knowledge about screening, were sent to four groups of mothers three weeks after screening: Group 1 consisted of mothers whose babies had clear responses on a first or second screening test (n=103); Group 2 consisted of mothers whose babies had clear responses on the third screening test (n=81); Group 3 consisted of mothers whose babies did not have clear responses in one ear at the third screening test and were referred for audiological assessment (n=105); and Group 4 consisted of mothers whose babies did not have clear responses in either ear at the third hearing test and were referred for audiological assessment (n=55). RESULTS: Although mean anxiety levels were in the normal range, there was a significant trend for anxiety to rise as testing increased (F(1,327)=4.280, P<0.05). Worry increased significantly (F(1,337)=70.432, P<0.001) and certainty decreased significantly (F(1,339)=27.474, P=0.001) as the number of tests increased. Although total knowledge did not significantly moderate anxiety (R(2)=0.016, P=0.096), there was a significant interaction between mothers' group and one knowledge item, understanding that receipt of no clear responses was unlikely to mean that the baby had a hearing loss: mothers in Group 4 who understood this had lower anxiety (F(3,323)=4.791, P<0.01) and lower worry (F(3,332)=3.565, P<0.01) compared with mothers who did not. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the meaning of being recalled following screening may avoid some of the anxiety associated with this.
22226572<<>>Loss<<>>Short-term efficacy and safety of zonisamide as adjunctive treatment for refractory partial seizures: a multicenter open-label single-arm trial in Korean patients.<<>>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjunctive zonisamide (ZNS) therapy in Korean adults with uncontrolled partial epilepsy. METHODS: Study patients had an average of at least one seizure per 4-week (averaged over a 12-week historical baseline) despite the use of one to three antiepileptic drugs. The starting dose of ZNS was 100mg/day, and was increased to 200mg/day after 2weeks. During the 12-week maintenance period, the dose of ZNS was adjusted to 200-400mg/day based on the physicians' discretion. The global evaluation scale (GES) and quality of life (QOLIE-31) were also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 121 patients were enrolled, of which 88 patients completed the study. The median percent reduction in weekly seizure frequency over the treatment period was 59.0%. The >/=50% and >/=75% responder rates were 57.3% and 38.5%, respectively. Seizure freedom over the treatment period was observed in 25 patients, but seizure freedom throughout the 16-week treatment period was attained in only 16 patients. On investigator's GES, 84 patients were considered improved, with 33 patients showing marked improvement. In QOLIE-31 scale, seizure worry improved significantly but emotional well-being deteriorated. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were reported in 80 patients. The most common AEs were dizziness (28.1%), somnolence (24.0%), anorexia (18.2%), headache (14.0%), nausea (13.2%), and weight loss (10.7%). Twenty-two patients discontinued the trial due to drug-related AEs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that adjunctive ZNS therapy for the treatment of refractory partial epilepsy, though efficacious, is associated with significant tolerability problems.
24072335<<>>Loss<<>>Online access to doctors' notes: patient concerns about privacy.<<>>BACKGROUND: Offering patients online access to medical records, including doctors' visit notes, holds considerable potential to improve care. However, patients may worry about loss of privacy when accessing personal health information through Internet-based patient portals. The OpenNotes study provided patients at three US health care institutions with online access to their primary care doctors' notes and then collected survey data about their experiences, including their concerns about privacy before and after participation in the intervention. OBJECTIVE: To identify patients' attitudes toward privacy when given electronic access to their medical records, including visit notes. METHODS: The design used a nested cohort study of patients surveyed at baseline and after a 1-year period during which they were invited to read their visit notes through secure patient portals. Participants consisted of 3874 primary care patients from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA), Geisinger Health System (Danville, PA), and Harborview Medical Center (Seattle, WA) who completed surveys before and after the OpenNotes intervention. The measures were patient-reported levels of concern regarding privacy associated with online access to visit notes. RESULTS: 32.91% of patients (1275/3874 respondents) reported concerns about privacy at baseline versus 36.63% (1419/3874 respondents) post-intervention. Baseline concerns were associated with non-white race/ethnicity and lower confidence in communicating with doctors, but were not associated with choosing to read notes or desire for continued online access post-intervention (nearly all patients with notes available chose to read them and wanted continued access). While the level of concern among most participants did not change during the intervention, 15.54% (602/3874 respondents, excluding participants who responded "don't know") reported more concern post-intervention, and 12.73% (493/3874 respondents, excluding participants who responded "don't know") reported less concern. CONCLUSIONS: When considering online access to visit notes, approximately one-third of patients had concerns about privacy at baseline and post-intervention. These perceptions did not deter participants from accessing their notes, suggesting that the benefits of online access to medical records may outweigh patients' perceived risks to privacy.
26600705<<>>Loss<<>>Symptoms experienced by cancer patients and barriers to symptom management.<<>>BACKGROUND: People living with cancer experience wide variety of symptoms. If symptoms are not managed well, it may hamper an individual's ability to continue his or her activities of daily life. Treatment of symptoms relieves suffering and improves the rate of recovery as well as the quality of life. OBJECTIVES: To assess the symptoms of suffering among cancer patients and to identify the perceived barriers to their symptom management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out among 768 cancer patients selected by stratified sampling with a proportionate selection from each stratum. Data were collected from cancer patients by interview technique using structured validated questionnaire. RESULTS: Majority of the samples (30.2%) belonged to the age group of 51-60 years, most of them were diagnosed with head and neck cancer (40.1%) and 57.7% had stage III disease. The majority of the patients studied had pain (77%), tiredness (96.5%), disturbed sleep (96.4%), weight loss (63.3%), and irritability (85.7%). Most of the patients had lack of appetite (89.4%), feeling of sadness (96.6%), worry (94.5%), and feeling of nervousness (82.8%). Majority of the patients had some misconception regarding symptoms, that is, increasing pain signifies disease progression (92.7%), medicine to control pain may weaken the immune system (89.9%) and pain is inevitable for cancer patients (78.5%). Seventy-seven percent of samples reported that the anxiety or depression is expected after the diagnosis of cancer. CONCLUSION: This study provides an overview of symptoms among cancer patients and barriers experienced by them.
14695502<<>>Loss<<>>Current concepts in universal newborn hearing screening and early hearing detection and intervention programs.<<>>Newborns are routinely screened for hearing loss; screening typically occurs in the newborn nursery and newborn intensive care unit. Understanding the process and outcomes of initial hearing screening and ongoing early hearing detection and intervention programs (EHDI) are important roles of the newborn/neonatal intensive care (NICU) nurse. Infants that require NICU care are at higher risk of hearing loss and need close follow-up and repeat hearing testing throughout their first 3 years of life. Parents experience anxiety and worry related to potential hearing loss problems and need guidance, education, and information on infant hearing to ensure the best possible outcome for their infant.
18431552<<>>Loss<<>>Quality of life one year after chemoradiotherapy for localized primary gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.<<>>We assessed the quality of life (QOL) at least one year after sequential chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of localized gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We used the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire for Stomach Cancer (EORTC QLQ-STO22). Among the 45 patients available at the one-year follow-up after radiation therapy, 40 patients completed the EORTC QLQ-STO22 questionnaire. Their median age was 54.5 (range, 20-70 years). Social functioning was most adversely affected among the respondents with a score of 59, whereas other functions and the global scales were preserved above a score of 70 by linearly transformed values. Fatigue, the financial impact and specific emotional problems such as "thinking about their illness" (STO-ANX) and "worry about weight loss or future health" (STO-BI) were persistently bothersome for some patients. Other stomach-related symptoms such as dysphagia, pain, or reflux were negligible at 1 year after treatment. Therefore, this organ-preserving combined approach was effective for the maintenance of the QOL and minimization of stomach abnormalities in patients with gastric lymphoma.
28869033<<>>Loss<<>>Life course of children with parental multiple sclerosis.<<>>BACKGROUND: The majority of persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience onset of MS between the ages of 20 and 40. Since two-thirds of the persons with MS are young women of childbearing age, parenthood is an essential issue during this period of life. The potential influence of parental MS on children arises from the varied symptoms of the chronic illness, which affect physical and cognitive abilities. MS disabilities and fatigue can restrict daily life and result in less energy for activities or job loss and thus worse conditions for the family. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: This PhD thesis was designed to investigate whether parental MS influences children in different areas throughout the children's life course (i.e. education, employment, disability pension, and income) as well as to explore the experiences of having a parent with MS. We investigated the research question using two distinct METHODS: A quantitative method based on nationwide population-based Danish registers comparing a group of children with one biological parent with MS (termed 'MS offspring') with a matched group of children of parents without MS (termed 'reference cohort') up to 58 years of age (Papers I-II). A qualitative method based on phenomenological face-to-face interviews with young adults with parental MS (Paper III). The nationwide register-based epidemiological method complemented by a phenomenological interview method, the long time-span and the age groups of 'children' up to age 58 are original within this area of research. RESULTS: In Paper I, we investigated the educational achievements of 4,177 MS offspring compared with 33,416 reference children. MS off-spring achieved a higher grade point average in the final class of basic school, at age 15, although they achieved similar educational levels as did the reference children at ages 15 to 58. There was a trend toward more MS offspring women attaining health-related educations than did reference women at ages 21 to 58. In Paper II, we investigated employment and income of 2,456 MS offspring compared with 19,648 reference children. At age 30, the MS offspring were less often employed, and at ages 30 and 40 MS offspring more often received disability pension than did reference children. The mean income at the age interval of 45 to 49 years was similar. Analyzing whether the MS offspring earned more than DKK 250,000 annually (~ EUR 33,650), which is approximately double the level defined as poverty in Denmark in 2012, they earned above this level in annual gross personal in-come less frequently than did reference children. This income level was only sufficient for the bare necessities. In Paper III, we explored the experiences of children growing up with a parent with MS by interviewing 14 young adults between 18 and 25 years. The results in the interview study showed two essential themes: 'Caring' and 'Restraint'. Each essential theme emerged from four subthemes. Caring: Assuming responsibility; worry and guilt; choosing health-related educations; advantage of being responsible. Restraint: Concealing feelings and desires; anxiety and depression; shame; lack of openness and knowledge. All the young adults had experiences of the essential themes of caring and restraint. Half of the participants in the interview study were enrolled in a health-related education. CONCLUSION: Growing up with a parent with MS can have both beneficial and adverse influences on children late into adulthood. On the one hand, the educational achievements of MS offspring are either better or similar to those of reference children because they attained better grades and similar educational levels. Also, some of the young adults interviewed found advantages to having learned to be responsible. On the other hand, we found an ad-verse association regarding employment, disability pension, and income. Also, the young adults interviewed had experiences of caring for and of practicing restraint toward the parent with MS, the other parent, and siblings, with most participants continuing this pattern toward friends and partners. The results of caring and restraint might partly explain some of the associations found in the register-based studies. The children might continue taking care of their parents and striving to find a balance between helping others and fulfilling their own desires. This caregiver challenge might also partly explain the beneficial association between parental MS on education and the adverse association on employment. Thus, having a parent with MS might be associated with long-term socioeconomic influence on education, employment, disability pension, income, and social relations in children's life course: Parental MS influences children far into adulthood.
17927921<<>>Loss<<>>Acceptability, benefit and costs of early screening for hearing disability: a study of potential screening tests and models.<<>>OBJECTIVES: To show that hearing loss has such a high prevalence in the older population to justify screening, if effective and acceptable methods are available; and that population take-up and benefit can make a measurable outcome difference in quality of life. DESIGN: A population study of people aged 55-74 years was undertaken. A clinical effectiveness study of differently organised screening programmes was carried out using a controlled trial to identify those who might benefit from intervention (and the extent of the benefit). A retrospective case-control study examined the very long-term (more than 10 years) compliance of patients in using their hearing aids after early identification and determined the extent to which early-identified hearing-impaired people have better outcomes than equivalent people identified later. An examination of the costs and cost-effectiveness of different potential screening programmes was also undertaken. SETTING: A population study was designed in the UK, with specific stages being conducted in more depth on a sample of people from Nottingham and Southampton. The clinical effectiveness study was conducted in general practices in Nottingham and Bath using a systematic or opportunistic screen. The retrospective case-control study compared a group of early-identified hearing aid users, with control matched for age, gender and occupation, in Cardiff, Glasgow and Manchester. PARTICIPANTS: In Great Britain responses were obtained for 34,362 individuals from the postal questionnaire as part of a population study, 506 were interviewed, 351 were assessed for benefit from amplification and 87 were fitted with a hearing aid. The clinical effectiveness study received 1461 replies from the first-stage questionnaire screen, with 306 people assessed in the clinic, of whom 156 were fitted with hearing aids. The retrospective case-control study traced 116 previously fitted hearing aid users, who had been identified by a screen, and then conducted a case-control using 50 of these for whom complete data were available, matching with two control groups of 50 people. INTERVENTIONS: The major prospective interventions were to introduce amplification through offering people, with minimal hearing impairment, hearing aid(s) in a rehabilitative setting. In the population study, aids were offered as a monaural in-the-ear (ITE) hearing aid and in the clinical effectiveness study people who met the criteria were randomised to be offered two different ITE hearing aids to be fitted bilaterally. The retrospective case-control study used unilateral and bilateral hearing aids. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of hearing problems and degree to which services meet need in 55-74-year age group. Public acceptability and individual benefits of hearing screening and intervention as a function of demographic and hearing domain-specific characteristics. Improvement in quality of life. Screening costs and cost-effectiveness as a function of proposed programmes. RESULTS: It was found that 12% of people aged 55-74 years have a hearing problem that causes moderate or severe worry, annoyance or upset, 14% have a bilateral hearing impairment of at least 35 dB hearing level (HL) and only 3% currently receive intervention, through the use of hearing aids. Good amplification was shown to benefit about one in four of this 55-74-year-old population and the degree of hearing loss predicted benefit well. Overall, there was a strong correlation between benefit from amplification and from using hearing aids. Questionnaires and audiometric screens gave good screening operating characteristics. The systematic screening programme was more acceptable and gave a better response than the opportunistic. About 70% of those who were offered an aid accepted a bilateral fitting. This increased to 95% for those with > or =35 dB HL (averaged over 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz in the better ear). The retrospective case-control study showed that long-term hearing aid use was low, unless hearing impairment was quite high (e.g. >35 dB HL). Those identified early had greater benefit through additional years of use/better adaptation to use than those of the same age and hearing impairment who were fitted with hearing aids later. Different screening programmes were modelled. The 35 dB HL better ear average hearing impairment level was found to be a good, robust and justifiable target group for screening and here the most efficient and practicable method was to use two questions in primary care concerning hearing problems and a hearing screen using a pure tone at 3 kHz 35 dB HL. The average cost of the screening programme was 13 pounds per person screened or about 100 pounds if treatment costs were included. Making the conservative assumption that identification gives an extra 9 years using hearing aids, the costs of screening and intervention were in the range of 800-1000 pounds per quality-adjusted life-year when using the Health Utilities Index and about 2500 pounds using the Short Form 6 Dimensions metric. CONCLUSIONS: A simple systematic screen, using an audiometric screening instrument, has been shown to be acceptable to people in the age range 55-74 years, is likely to provide substantial benefit and may be cost-effective to those in that target group. Hearing screening appears to meet the National Screening Committee's criteria in most respects, provided screening is targeted at those with at least 35 dB HL better ear average. Based on the research carried out here there is sufficient evidence to support a larger and more definitive study of hearing screening. Further research into who should be referred for and benefit from audiological assessment and provision of hearing aid in a primary care trust setting is needed as is investigation into screening devices and the various aspects of introducing such a programme.
23013843<<>>Loss<<>>DiAlert: a prevention program for overweight first degree relatives of type 2 diabetes patients: results of a pilot study to test feasibility and acceptability.<<>>BACKGROUND: Prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasing due to lifestyle changes, particularly affecting those genetically at risk. We developed DiAlert as a targeted group-based intervention aimed to promote intrinsic motivation and action planning for lifestyle changes and weight loss in first degree relatives of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.The main objective of the pilot of the DiAlert intervention was to assess fidelity, feasibility and acceptability prior to starting the randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Individuals with a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus were self-identified and screened for eligibility. DiAlert consists of two group sessions. Feasibility, fidelity, acceptability and self-reported perceptions and behavioral determinants were evaluated in a pre-post study using questionnaires and observations. Determinants of behavior change were analyzed using paired-samples t tests and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. RESULTS: DiAlert was delivered to two groups of first degree relatives of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (N = 9 and N = 12). Feasibility and fidelity were confirmed. Overall, the DiAlert group sessions were positively evaluated (8.0 on a scale of 1 to 10) by participants. The intervention did not impact perceived susceptibility or worry about personal diabetes risk. Action planning with regard to changing diet and physical activity increased. CONCLUSIONS: DiAlert proved feasible and was well-accepted by participants. Positive trends in action planning indicate increased likelihood of actual behavior change following DiAlert. Testing the effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial is imperative. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherlands National Trial Register (NTR): NTR2036.
27943570<<>>Loss<<>>Telephone-delivered individual cognitive behavioural therapy for cancer patients: An equivalence randomised trial.<<>>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate Telephone-Delivered Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (T-CBT) compared to CBT face to face treatment as usual (TAU-CBT), in cancer patients with high psychological needs, in terms of mental health and coping. METHOD: A prospective randomised equivalence trial with Patient Reported Outcome (PRO's), measured pre- and post-therapy including; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale: Helpless/Hopeless subscale only (MAC H/H), Checklist of Cancer Concerns (CLCC) and the Cancer Coping Questionnaire (CCQ). A study-specific Service Evaluation Questionnaire (SEQ) was include. RESULTS: Assessment of change scores, in n = 118 randomised patients referred for psychological care, indicate significant improvements (P < 0.01 or greater) for both therapy groups pre- and post-therapy in HADS anxiety, depression and total scores and cancer concerns (CLCC). Overall, for the groups combined, there is a significant shift towards reduction of CCQ stress (P = 0.028) and worry (P = 0.003) post-therapy when compared to baseline levels. Median number of therapy sessions was four. For cancer coping (CCQ) and for Mental Adjustment to Cancer (MAC) there were significant change scores only for Positive Focus and Helpless/hopeless scores respectively, in the TAU-CBT group. Although equivalence was not observed, the data demonstrate that T-CBT was non-inferior to TAU-CBT. CONCLUSIONS: Delivery of CBT to patients with clinician identified high need can be offered according to patient choice without loss of mental health benefit. Both TAU-CBT and T-CBT are effective at reducing mental health problems on the specific outcome measures.
18512998<<>>Loss<<>>Treating depression in terminally ill patients can optimize their physical comfort at the end of life and provide them the opportunity to confront and prepare for death.<<>>The dying process is characterized by feelings of sadness and fear. It is normal for patients at the end of life to worry and grieve the loss of their health. However, when these feelings become excessive and interfere with all aspects of the patient's life, they are abnormal responses to the stress of terminal illness. Screening for depression in terminally ill patients can optimize their physical comfort at the end of life and provide them the opportunity to confront and prepare for death.
20497281<<>>Loss<<>>Trends in adolescent emotional problems in England: a comparison of two national cohorts twenty years apart.<<>>BACKGROUND: Evidence about trends in adolescent emotional problems (depression and anxiety) is inconclusive, because few studies have used comparable measures and samples at different points in time. We compared rates of adolescent emotional problems in two nationally representative English samples of youth 20 years apart using identical symptom screens in each survey. METHODS: Nationally representative community samples of 16-17-year-olds living in England in 1986 and 2006 were compared. In 1986, 4524 adolescents and 7120 parents of young people participated in the age-16-year follow-up of the 1970 British Cohort Study. In 2006, 719 adolescents and 734 parents participated in a follow-up of children sampled from the 2002/2003 Health Surveys for England. Adolescents completed the Malaise Inventory and 12-item General Health Questionnaire. Parents completed the Rutter-A scale. Individual symptoms of depression and anxiety were coded combining across relevant questionnaire items. Young people also reported frequency of feeling anxious or depressed. RESULTS: Youth- and parent-reported emotional problems were more prevalent in 2006 for girls, and rates of parent-reported problems increased for boys. Twice as many young people reported frequent feelings of depression or anxiety in 2006 as in 1986. Some symptoms showed marked change in prevalence over time (e.g., worry, irritability, fatigue), whereas others showed no change (e.g., loss of enjoyment, worthlessness). There was no evidence of differential trends in emotional problems for young people from socially advantaged and disadvantaged or intact and non-intact families. Changes in family structure and ethnic composition did not account for trends in youth emotional problems. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides evidence for a substantial increase in adolescent emotional problems in England over recent decades, especially among girls.
24848262<<>>Loss<<>>The impact of gastrostomy in motor neurone disease: challenges and benefits from a patient and carer perspective.<<>>OBJECTIVES: This study explores the experience of gastrostomy insertion from the perspective of the patients and their informal carers. Gastrostomy feeding is commonly used to support motor neurone disease (MND) patients with dysphagia. However, there is lack of information describing patient and carer experiences following gastrostomy insertion. The effect of gastrostomy on quality of life for these patients and their family is currently not well understood. METHODS: Retrospective qualitative exploration using semistructured interviews with patients and their informal carers to elicit in-depth descriptions of their experiences and views following gastrostomy. RESULTS: 27 patients consented to the study; of these, 23 underwent a successful gastrostomy. 10 patients and 8 carers were interviewed, approximately 3 months following a successful gastrostomy. Participants described clinical complications, practical issues, time restrictions imposed by strict feeding regimens and psychological issues, which adversely impacted on quality of life. However, the establishment of a safe alternative route for feeding and medication, and the reduced worry over difficult meals and weight loss, were described by all as outweighing these negative impacts. Participants also described having received education/training on gastrostomy feeding both in hospital and in the community, which helped them to cope during the transition from oral to gastrostomy feeding. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the challenges and benefits of gastrostomy as well as the importance of education and information provision. Emphasis should be given to education before and after insertion along with support and care in the community. While the significant impact of gastrostomy on patients and carers should not be underestimated, the potential benefits were described as outweighing these concerns.
18929341<<>>Loss<<>>Acute chest pain emergencies - spouses' prehospital experiences.<<>>The call to the Emergency Medical Dispatch Centre is often a person's first contact with the health-care system in cases of acute illness or injury and acute chest pain is a common reason for calling. The aim was to illuminate how spouses to persons with acute chest pain experienced the alarm situation, the emergency call and the prehospital emergency care. Interviews were conducted with nineteen spouses. A phenomenological-hermeneutic approach was used for the analyses. The themes responsibility and uneasiness emerged as well as an overall theme of aloneness. Being a spouse to a person in need of acute medical and nursing assistance was interpreted as "Being responsible and trying to preserve life" and "Being able to manage the uneasiness and having trust in an uncertain situation." When their partners' life was at risk the spouses were in an escalating spiral of worry, uncertainty, stress, fear of loss, feeling of loneliness and desperation. They had to manage emotional distress and felt compelled to act to preserve life, a challenging situation.
17618467<<>>Loss<<>>The influence of xerostomia after radiotherapy on quality of life: results of a questionnaire in head and neck cancer.<<>>INTRODUCTION: Xerostomia is a common complication of radiotherapy for head and neck cancer because irreparable damage is caused to the salivary glands if they are included in the radiation fields. The aim of the study was to evaluate the degree of xerostomia in survivors of head and neck cancer and to determine its impact on quality of life. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A xerostomia questionnaire consisting of three parts (xerostomia score, quality of life survey, and visual analogue scale) was completed by 75 head and neck cancer patients, more than 6 months after radiotherapy and without evidence of disease. RESULTS: The majority of patients (93%) suffered from a dry mouth, and 65% had moderate to severe xerostomia (grade 2 to 3). Both dysphagia (65%) and taste loss (63%) were common, although oral pain was less frequent (33%). The emotional impact of xerostomia was significant, causing worry (64%), tension (61%), or feelings of depression (44%). Furthermore, patients reported problems with talking to (60%) or eating with (54%) other people and to feel restricted in amount and type of food (65%). Quality of life was influenced by T classification, clinical stage, a higher radiation dose or the use of concomitant chemotherapy, but was independent of the interval since the end of radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Xerostomia after radiotherapy for head and neck cancer is extremely common and significantly affects quality of life. No recuperation is seen over time, and the use of concomitant chemotherapy significantly increases the oral complications of radiation. These results warrant the continuing efforts put into the development of salivary gland-sparing radiotherapy techniques and effective treatments of radiation-induced xerostomia.
19919550<<>>Loss<<>>Prevention, adaptation, and threat denial: flooding experiences in the Netherlands.<<>>Delta areas such as the Netherlands are more and more at risk of future flooding due to global climate change. Motivating residents living in flood-prone areas to effectively cope with local floods may lead to minimization of material losses and loss of life. The aim of this research was to investigate whether the extent to which residents had been exposed to flooding in the past was a key factor in motivating residents to effectively cope with future flooding. We also focused on the psychological variables that mediated this relationship. We conducted a survey (N = 516) among flood victims and nonvictims. We assessed subjective experiences due to past flooding, affective and cognitive appraisals, and coping responses. Results show that victims reported stronger emotions (negative and positive), and the receipt of more social support due to past flooding than did nonvictims. Moreover, victims worry more about future flooding, perceive themselves as more vulnerable to future flooding, perceive the consequences of future flooding as more severe, and have stronger intentions to take adaptive actions in the future than nonvictims. Structural equation modeling reveals that the latter effect was fully mediated by specific experiences and appraisals. Insights into factors and processes that have the potential to motivate residents to effectively cope with future floods may prove helpful in developing interventions to inform residents how to act effectively in case of an imminent flood.
11754134<<>>Loss<<>>Anxiety, depression, and the content of worries.<<>>Worry content as assessed by using a modified Worry Domains Questionnaire (WDQ) was compared among participants diagnosed with a depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and both a depressive disorder and GAD. A discriminant function analysis of worry domains yielded two significant functions. The worry domains Lack of Confidence, Aimless Future, Relationships, and Financial Concerns loaded significantly on Function 1, which was termed "Depressive Worries." The worry domain Loss of Control loaded significantly on Function 2, which was termed "Anxious Worries." The three participant groups differed in their pattern of worries in a way that lends support to the content-specificity hypothesis for both depression and anxiety. In addition, multiple regression analysis indicated that WDQ domain scores (in particular the Aimless Future domain) predicted the severity of depressive symptoms even after the variance contributed by anxiety symptoms was removed from the analysis. These findings suggest that the content of a person's worries may be significantly associated with the presence of depression, anxiety, or comorbid depression and anxiety.
26991024<<>>Loss<<>>Nursing implications: symptom presentation and quality of life in rectal cancer patients.<<>>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the changes in symptoms experienced by rectal cancer patients during preoperative chemoradiotherapy, with a specific focus on fatigue and to explore how symptoms impact the quality of life. BACKGROUND: Rectal cancer continues to be a healthcare issue internationally, despite advances in management strategies, which includes the administration of preoperative chemoradiotherapy to improve locoregional control. It is known that this treatment may cause adverse effects; however, there is a paucity of literature that specifically examines fatigue, symptoms and quality of life in this patient cohort. DESIGN: A prospective, quantitative correlational design using purposive sampling was adopted. METHODS: Symptoms and quality of life were measured with validated questionnaires in 35 patients at four time points. RESULTS: Symptoms that changed significantly over time as examined using rm-anova include fatigue, bowel function issues, nutritional issues, pain, dermatological issues and urinary function issues. Findings indicate that fatigue leads to poorer quality of life, with constipation, bloating, stool frequency, appetite loss, weight worry, nausea and vomiting, dry mouth and pain also identified as influencing factors on quality of life. CONCLUSION: Findings have highlighted the importance of thorough symptom assessment and management of patients receiving preoperative chemoradiotherapy, particularly midway through treatment, in order to optimise quality of life and minimise interruptions to treatment. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Close monitoring of symptoms during preoperative chemoradiotherapy, particularly at week 4, will enable the implementation of timely interventions so that interruptions to treatment are prevented and the quality of life is optimised, which may hasten postoperative recovery times.
28126098<<>>Loss<<>>Losing ground, losing sleep: Local economic conditions, economic vulnerability, and sleep.<<>>Medical research shows that healthy sleep has benefits for human wellbeing. We contribute to the emerging social-epidemiological literature on the social determinants of sleep by considering how living in an area with poor economic circumstances can result in sleep loss through financial worry, uncertainty and stress. We use multilevel regression models and nationally-representative data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey (n = 9181) and find that individuals who live in areas with high unemployment rates or experience individual-level economic vulnerability sleep less than comparable individuals in areas with low unemployment rates, or who do not experience financial hardships. The negative association between local economic conditions and sleep duration is substantially stronger amongst economically vulnerable individuals. This highlights the importance of considering multiple levels in the analysis of health inequalities, as status and location can intersect to produce and reproduce disadvantage systems.
22575329<<>>Loss<<>>Functional MRI of the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis during conditions of uncertainty in generalized anxiety disorder.<<>>Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by constant worry or anxiety over every day life activities and events. The neurobiology of the disorder is thought to involve a wide cortical and subcortical network that includes but is not limited to the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). These two regions have been hypothesized to play different roles in stress and anxiety; the amygdala is thought to regulate responses to brief emotional stimuli while the BNST is thought to be involved in more chronic regulation of sustained anxiety. In this study, we exposed medication-free GAD patients as well as non-anxious controls to a gambling game where one of the conditions involved non-contingent monetary loss. This condition of high uncertainty was intended to elicit a stressful response and sustained anxiety. Functional MRI scans were collected simultaneously to investigate BOLD activity in the amygdala and BNST during performance of this task. Compared to controls, we found that GAD patients demonstrated decreased activity in the amygdala and increased activity in the BNST. Skin conductance measures showed a consistent early versus late effect within block where GAD patients demonstrated higher arousal than controls late in the task blocks. Based on these results, we hypothesize that GAD patients disengage the amygdala and its response to acute stress earlier than non-anxious controls making way for the BNST to maintain a more sustained response. Future studies are needed to investigate the temporal dynamics of activation and deactivation in these regions.
18558909<<>>Loss<<>>What do general practitioners think depression is? A taxonomy of distress and depression for general practice.<<>>OBJECTIVE: To create a taxonomy of distress and depression for use in primary care, that mirrors the thinking and practice of experienced general practitioners. DESIGN: Qualitative study, using an ethnomethodological approach, with observation of videotaped routine GP-patient consultations and in-depth interviews with GPs. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted in metropolitan Melbourne in 2005. Fourteen GPs conducted 36 patient consultations where depression was a focus; nine GPs participated in in-depth interviews to elicit details of how they recognised and diagnosed depression in their patients. RESULTS: GPs consider distress and depression in three steps. In the first step, a change in a group of symptoms and signs is observed (eg, facial expression, loss of drive). The second step categorises the syndrome according to whether or not there is an identifiable environmental cause (reactive or "endogenous"), with the final step categorising the reactive syndromes according to their most prominent symptoms: either anxiety and worry, or helplessness and hopelessness. The resulting taxonomy includes: endogenous depression (a chronic and perhaps characterological depression characterised by a lack of interest and motivation); anxious depressive reaction (stress or worry); and hopeless depressive reaction (demoralisation). CONCLUSION: This simple and parsimonious taxonomy has validity based on its derivation from within the primary care setting.
18808300<<>>Loss<<>>Life after placement: experiences of older rural caregivers after placing a family member into residential care.<<>>INTRODUCTION: The community care philosophy in Australia has led to a number of older people remaining in their own homes, dependant on others for the majority of their care needs. A small number of older people being cared for by a family member or friend will move into residential aged care facilities for full-time care. This article describes a qualitative study that explored the meanings that older rural Australian caregivers gave to their day-to-day lives after their care-receiver had entered full-time residential aged care. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with seven older caregivers were conducted to gain understandings about their 'life after placement'. Thematic analysis was employed to identify common themes. Quality of life concepts provided the boundaries to the research questions. RESULTS: The sample included four men and three women. In the study, the men reported spending more time continuing their carer role, while the women reported being more focussed on reconnecting with the community. Both men and women reported that their own health was a major constraint in being able to maintain these two tasks. The findings mirrored those of similar studies with one notable exception: this study highlighted the meanings that caregivers gave to their lives after placement in a more holistic way, as opposed to focussing on caregivers in relation to the residential aged care facility context alone. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that there are differences found in relation to gender and tasks after in-home caring roles have ended. Worry about loss of driving ability was a major concern in the caregivers' lives. The experiences of the caregivers in this study give a better understanding of what life is like for caregivers after in-home caring has ceased. Understanding of 'life after placement' expands our knowledge about carers and the role of carer. The findings suggest a need for funding and programs for caregivers after their in-home carer role has ended to assist caregivers (particularly men) in reconnecting with people and activities outside their immediate family. The findings may direct rural community development workers to appreciate the challenges that older rural caregivers face when their in-home caring role ends and visiting and socializing is dependant on their ability to drive. This study also offers a perspective for residential aged care staff to consider as they work with families placing an older family member into full-time care. If aged care staff recognise the value of the continuing caring role of the caregiver and integrate them into the care plan, enhanced positive outcomes could transpire for both caregiver and care-recipient.
18207694<<>>Loss<<>>Interventions to improve risk communication in clinical genetics: systematic review.<<>>OBJECTIVE: Effective risk communication may enable clients to participate effectively in decision-making about their health and health care. A systematic review of existing literature on risk communication in genetics, and its effects on key outcomes for clients, was undertaken. METHOD: Systematic searching of six electronic databases and data extraction from included studies; narrative synthesis of results. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were included, principally from cancer genetics. Sixteen communication interventions have been evaluated, generally showing improvements in cognitive outcomes for users, such as knowledge, understanding and risk perception, and without adverse effects on anxiety, cancer-related worry and depression. However, often it was the supportive or emotional elements of counselling that provided benefits to users, rather than the informational or educational elements. Similar results were found in 12 further studies of decision aids which also appear to achieve shorter consultations that can focus more on the supportive elements of counselling. CONCLUSION: For both communication models and decision aids, the supportive or emotional elements of counselling provided more benefits to users than the informational or educational elements. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Debate is required on how to strike a balance between the medical model, its agenda and perceived requirements to disclose or discuss a range of issues and the sometimes competing goals of addressing users' concerns, needs for support, issues of loss and relationship problems.
19036534<<>>Loss<<>>[Effects of mobile phones and radar radiofrequencies on the eye].<<>>The increasing applications of microwaves, mainly in mobile phones and radar, induce a higher rate of exposed people, sometimes cause of worry. Eyeballs are hotspots of radiofrequency field radiation because of their anatomy and composition. We propose a review of the various effects on the eye. The studies are hardly comparable because the exposure systems, power densities and dosimetries are different. While the thermal effects on the eye are well known including cataracts, corneal edema, endothelial cell loss and retinal degeneration, the non-thermal effects are still controversial. Cell cycle abnormalities, early apoptosis were reported in experimental conditions likely due to oxidative stress, but the studies could not show any significant effect on human eyes when exposed to long-term and low-dose radiation. Next studies need to be closer to human exposure.
18321028<<>>Loss<<>>Sexual deception as a social-exchange process: development of a behavior-based sexual deception scale.<<>>The use of deception in association with sexual encounters may take many forms, ranging from outright lies to more subtle, evasive manipulations. To address such deceptions, a behavior-based sexual deception scale was developed utilizing social exchange theory. Participants were 267 individuals associated with two large universities who were surveyed regarding different aspects of their sexual deceptive behaviors. In addition, items addressing sexually related behaviors and attitudes were assessed for validation purposes. Principal components analysis identified three components of sexual deception, labeled Blatant Lying, Self-Serving, and Avoiding Confrontation. Confirmatory factor analysis verified the resulting structure, and promising validity was noted. In general, those using any of these deceptions reported more sexual partners and one-night stands. Those telling blatant lies to have sex were more likely to report greater needs for sex, while those using self-serving lies or having sex to avoid confrontation experienced greater worry about partner loss. Men were more likely to use blatant lies to have sex, while women were more likely to have sex to avoid confrontation. Results support sexual deception as an exchange process, with sex for pleasure and positive relationship outcomes acting as rewards, and unwanted sex and deception consequences as costs. Implications for health interventions and primary prevention applications are discussed.
17666380<<>>Loss<<>>Habitat fragmentation may not matter to species diversity.<<>>Conservation biologists worry that fragmenting a bloc of natural habitat might reduce its species diversity. However, they also recognize the difficulty and importance of isolating the effect of fragmentation from that of simple loss of area. Using two different methods (species-area curve and Fisher's alpha index of diversity) to analyse the species diversities of plants, tenebrionid beetles and carabid beetles in a highly fragmented Mediterranean scrub landscape, we decoupled the effect of degree of fragmentation from that of area loss. In this system, fragmentation by itself seems not to have influenced the number of species. Our results, obtained at the scale of hectares, agree with similar results at island and continent scales.
23750563<<>>Loss<<>>Chronic pain and the development of a symptom checklist: a pilot study.<<>>BACKGROUND: There is currently no instrument to systematically assess the range of symptoms/problems and their bothersomeness in patients with chronic non-cancer pain (CNPN). Systematic assessment and prioritizing may target treatments and improve outcomes. METHODS: The authors developed a checklist of symptoms and problems, the Copenhagen Symptom Checklist (CSC), presented clinically by patients. Fifty-three items representing biological, psychological and social areas were selected. Symptom/problem severity was rated on a 5-point scale anchored at 0 = 'not at all' and 4 = 'severe'. Patients ranked the five most bothersome symptoms/problems and could add five open-ended items. Patients completed the CSC after the first visit at the multidisciplinary pain centre. RESULTS: One hundred and twelve consecutive patients completed the CSC. Eighty-nine percent scored pain as rather severe or very severe (score = 3 plus score = 4), followed by reduction in physical activity (67%), fatigue (66%) and sleep disturbance (53%). Pain and fatigue, but not reduction in physical activity, were given highest priority. Cognitive problems were important to a third of the patients. Depressive symptoms, cognitive problems and worry explained 17.5% of the total variance. Patients filled in the CSC without important loss of information, but a minority prioritized more than three areas or used the free text alternative. CONCLUSIONS: Patients prioritized pain and fatigue as the most burdensome symptoms, but reduction in physical activity and sleep problems were also highly ranked. Patients were positive to the idea of symptom reporting; however, the 53-item number in this version of CSC is larger than may be necessary.

Psychological Assessment, 20, 248-259. doi:10.1037/a0012570) produce 8 distinguishable depressive symptom dimensions: dysphoria (anhedonia, sadness, psychomotor disturbance, worthlessness, worry, and cognitive difficulty), lassitude (anergia and hypersomnia), suicidality (self-harm thoughts/behaviors), ill temper (anger), well-being (positive thinking), appetite loss, appetite gain, and insomnia. The present study examined common and unique relations of IDAS depression subdimensions to (a) smoking rate (cigarettes perday), (b) tobacco dependence, and (c) smoking motivation. METHODS: Secondary analysis of cross-sectional associations in baseline data collected from 338 daily smokers enrolled in a larger cessation study. RESULTS: In individual models examining each symptom dimension in isolation, each symptom dimension was significantly with associated smoking rate, tobacco dependence, and/or various aspects of smoking motivation (e.g., subjective addiction, habit, appetite control, affect modulation). In combined models including all 8 dimensions as simultaneous regressor variables, dysphoria was the only dimension to retain most of its significant associations to smoking characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Relations of depressive symptoms to tobacco dependence, smoking rate, and motivation may be explained by (a) variance specific to dysphoria symptoms and (b) shared variance across depressive symptom subdimensions. Dysphoria symptoms, which contain core DSM-IV depression criteria, may be central to depression-smoking comorbidity, whereas other symptoms may play a less prominent role.
26247699<<>>Loss<<>>Health-Related Quality of Life in Community-Dwelling Persons Living With Enterocutaneous Fistulas.<<>>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to measure health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of community-dwelling patients with enterocutaneous fistulas (ECFs). DESIGN: The study was nonexperimental and used mixed methods, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative techniques to guide data collection and analysis. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Participants were recruited using a nonprobability, convenience sampling strategy. Patients living with ECFs in the community were identified by an ET nurse at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. INSTRUMENT: The questionnaire incorporated a modified version of the Stoma Quality of Life Scale (SQOLS); specifically, the term stoma was replaced with enterocutaneous fistula. The SQOLS is divided into 2 sections: The first queries overall satisfaction with life, and the second section queries 5 domains related to HRQOL, work/social functioning, sexual/body image, stoma (altered to query ECF) function, financial concerns, and skin irritation. This modified version of the SQOLS underwent face and content validation from clinicians with expertise in ECF management. METHODS: Questionnaires were distributed to eligible participants over a 20-month period in 2009 to 2010. Sixteen questionnaires were completed and returned yielding a response rate of 47.1%. RESULTS: Health-related quality of life was negatively affected by an ECF, as evidenced by low scores across all domains. The median scores for overall satisfaction with life in general in the past month were low (median scores 2.75 and 2.25, respectively) out of a possible score of 10. Respondents' median scores on 5 HRQOL domains queried by the SQOLS were also low at 25 to 39.59 out of 100. Thematic analysis of patient comments revealed a loss of normalcy, constant worry about the ECF and management of adjacent skin, depression and anxiety, and discomfort associated with presence of the ECF. The few positive comments primarily focused on support provided by family and caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study reveal that an ECF exerts a markedly negative impact on HRQOL that may be partially ameliorated by support from family and caregivers.
31062863<<>>Loss<<>>Does Removal of Work Stress Explain Improved Sleep Following Retirement? The Finnish Retirement and Aging (FIREA) study.<<>>STUDY OBJECTIVES: Relief from work stress has been hypothesized to explain improvements in sleep duration and quality following retirement, but this has not been confirmed with longitudinal studies. By using repeat sleep data, we examined the role of removal of work-related stressors in changes in sleep at retirement. METHODS: The study population consisted of 2,053 participants from the Finnish Retirement and Aging study. Participants' sleep duration, sleep difficulties (difficulties falling asleep, difficulties maintaining sleep, waking up too early in the morning, nonrestorative sleep), daytime tiredness, and sleep loss due to worry were assessed using surveys conducted once a year before and after retirement (average number of repeat surveys 3.5 [range 2-5] per participant). We used Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations to examine the associations between work-related stressors (job strain, low work time control, effort-reward imbalance, and organizational injustice) and changes in sleep at retirement. RESULTS: An increase in sleep duration and decrease in waking up too early in the morning, nonrestorative sleep, daytime tiredness, and sleep loss due to worry were observed shortly after retirement. No systematic associations across the work-related stressors and changes in sleep characteristics were observed. Higher number of work-related stressors before retirement was not associated with a greater magnitude of favorable changes in any of the post-retirement sleep characteristics investigated. CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal study suggests that perceived sleep improves shortly after retirement, and that these changes are mainly driven by factors other than relief from work stress.

Individuals worry about the presence of Alzheimer's disease, but the presence of other intact intellectual abilities is reassuring to these people. We do not know the cause of Alzheimer's disease. There are now 5.4 million confirmed cases in the United States. We know that the disease is an age-related, non-reversible brain disorder that develops over many years. Investigation is helped with the use of structural imaging (magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography). Functional imaging is also valuable. Therapy for the problem involves various drugs; these help but do not cure the difficulty.
8204711<<>>Loss<<>>Community worry about heart disease: a needs survey in the Coalfields and Newcastle areas of the Hunter region.<<>>A needs survey was administered by mail in the Coalfields area of the Hunter region (a lower socioeconomic area around Cessnock) and in a higher socioeconomic area of Newcastle. The purpose was to assist planning for Coalfields Healthy Heartbeat--a community-action heart disease prevention program. Response rates from random samples of residents were 435/897 (49 per cent) for the Coalfields and 565/875 (65 per cent) for Newcastle. In both study areas heart attack was ranked eleventh from a list of 17 potential community worries, well below drugs, crime, road safety, the environment, cancer and 'loss of health'. Coalfields respondents were more worried about all issues on the list than were the residents in Newcastle and were less likely to have heard about recent health promotion campaigns. Coalfields respondents felt that heart disease prevention was the responsibility of the individual, the family, and the medical profession, in that order, and much less the responsibility of local community groups. Results suggest that health promotion strategies incorporating values, language and symbols that are meaningful to distinct subgroups may be more successful than disease-specific programs aimed at the general population.
27891021<<>>Loss<<>>Progress in Medicine: Compensation and medical negligence in India: Does the system need a quick fix or an overhaul?<<>>In a recent judgment on medical negligence, the Supreme Court awarded compensation amounting to Rs. 11 crore to a victim, which was to be paid by the doctors and the private hospital deemed responsible for the wrongful death of a patient. This landmark decision was by far the largest compensation award in the history of Indian medical negligence litigation. Hence, the process of calculating compensation for medical negligence has received great attention and debate, largely due to the impact that it is going to have on the practice of medicine within the country, in the near future. However, the method of calculation of compensation is unpredictable as it varies hugely across different cases, courts and tribunals resulting, in a loss of faith in the system, protracted litigation, and frequent appeals. With over 80% of India's healthcare being provided by the private sector, predictability and uniformity in the regulation of compensation in medical negligence would benefit the victims and the doctors concerned. A basic knowledge of how medical negligence compensation is calculated and adjudicated in the judicial courts of India will aid a doctor in planning his/her professional indemnity insurance, as well as in practicing his/her profession without undue worry about facing litigation for alleged medical negligence. This article addresses the merits and demerits of large compensation awards, and also discusses whether the system is broken, needs a quick fix, or a massive overhaul.
20535083<<>>Loss<<>>Our world was rocked.<<>>CASE: Nicole is a beautiful 14-month wide-eyed girl who presents for routine health care maintenance in your office. Since her 9 month visit, her weight has fallen from the 25th percentile to significantly less than the 5th percentile. Her height has dropped from the 10th percentile to slightly less than the 5th percentile, while her head circumference has remained at about the 25th percentile. Her language, motor, cognitive, and social development are normal. She is 2 months late for this visit as her family has recently had significant family loss because of the earthquake in Haiti. When you take a feeding history, she seems to eat age-appropriate foods--macaroni, chicken pieces--but her mother notes that she tends to be restless and fidgety while eating and will no longer sit still in her mother's lap while she feeds her. Her stools tend to be frequent, with particles of food seen. Urine is normal. There are no symptoms of respiratory or neurological disease, and her review of systems is otherwise negative. She has been a healthy child and this is the first time they have fallen behind in routine health care maintenance visits. Her medical history is entirely unremarkable. She was born at term, weighing 3.5 kg, without any perinatal complications. The family has lived in the United States for the last 10 years. Mother recalls that there were other children in her family who were deemed small as young children but who caught up later in childhood. Mother describes a history of increased sadness and worry in the last 2 months. They receive phone calls from family in Haiti several times per week and she admits to being upset during and after these calls. When asked how the event has impacted her family, she states, "It has rocked our entire world but Nicole is just a baby who won't eat!" Parents are married, and there is no history of abuse or violence in the household. Her physical examination is essentially normal. Her anterior fontanelle is still open, roughly 2 cm. Two teeth (one just emerging) are present. She is alert and interactive and appears to relate well with her mother. You update her vaccinations and then struggle with where to head next.
19635661<<>>Loss<<>>Patients' and health care professionals' evaluation of health-related quality of life issues in bone metastases.<<>>The objective of this study was to examine the agreement between health care professionals' (HCPs) and patients' evaluation of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) issues for cancer patients with bone metastases. A total of 413 patients and 152 HCPs were interviewed across five centres worldwide. Mean scores were almost always higher for HCPs than for patients. Patients and HCPs agreed that four issues affect HRQOL of bone metastases patients profoundly: 'long-term (chronic) pain', 'difficulty in carrying out usual daily tasks', 'able to perform self-care' and 'able to perform role functioning'. A substantial difference was found with respect to the perceived importance of psychosocial and somatic issues. Patients emphasised psychosocial issues with a particular focus on 'worry' about loss of mobility, dependence on others and disease progression, HCPs however rated 'symptom' issues as more important, specifically those related to 'pain'. In conclusion, patients and HCPs agreed that pain and physical/role functioning are important to the HRQOL of cancer patients with bone metastases, but patients also emphasized the importance of psychosocial issues to HRQOL. This information has been an important component in the development of a health-related quality of life questionnaire for patients with bone metastases (EORTC QLQ-BM 22).
25186250<<>>Loss<<>>Associating a prototypical forbidden food item with guilt or celebration: relationships with indicators of (un)healthy eating and the moderating role of stress and depressive symptoms.<<>>The increase in obesity and the many educational messages prompting us to eat a healthy diet have heightened people's concerns about the effects of food choice on health and weight. An unintended side effect may be that such awareness fuels feelings of guilt and worry about food. Although guilt has the potential to motivate behaviour change, it may also lead to feelings of helplessness and loss of control. The current study examined the relationship between a default association of either 'guilt' or 'celebration' with a prototypical forbidden food item (chocolate cake), indicators of healthy eating and choosing food for mood regulation reasons. Following a 'diathesis-stress' perspective, the moderating roles of depressive symptoms and stress were examined. Although a default association of guilt was found to be harmless under some circumstances (i.e. under low stress), those who associated chocolate cake with guilt (vs. celebration) reported unhealthier eating habits and lower levels of perceived behavioural control over healthy eating when under stress, rated mood regulation reasons for food choice as important irrespective of their current affective state, and did not have more positive attitudes towards healthy eating. Implications for public health messages and interventions will be discussed.
24302820<<>>Loss<<>>A study to assess the emotional disorders with special reference to stress of medical students of agartala government medical college and govinda ballabh pant hospital.<<>>BACKGROUND: Stress is very common psychological phenomena where medical students faced in day to day activities. Epidemiological studies have asserted that about 70-80% of the diseases may be related to stress. Research related to this stress especially among medical students is essential, considering their learning, role and responsibilities as a future physician and health intervention programs. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of stress and identify stressors among medical students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Cross-sectional study was carried out among undergraduate medical students and self administered GHQ-12 and stressor questionnaire were used to collect information regarding stress. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to calculate odds ratio (OR). RESULTS: Prevalence of stress was 94.52% and more common among females. 33.56% students felt constantly under strain and 25.34% had loss of sleep over worry. Majority of the students of all semesters had stress (P > 0.05) and stressors viz. 'competition for marks' (P = 0.005), 'frequent examination' (P = 0.001), 'difficulty in finding time for recreation' (P = 0.014) and 'being away from home' (P = 0.027) were predominantly experienced by the 1(st) year medical students. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed the causal effect of main parameter on the GHQ caseness and students who found difficulties in following teaching language among the caseness had 81.59% higher chance of developing stress (OR = 8.159, CI = 1.228-54.213). CONCLUSION: The stress experience was more common due to academics and seen among all year of medical students. Strategy development for eliminating stressors is necessary for promoting healthy life.
21486707<<>>Loss<<>>It is time to remove the 'benign' from the essential tremor label.<<>>In recent years, studies of essential tremor (ET) have demonstrated that the disease is associated with functionally-relevant cognitive abnormalities, a mood disturbance and other psychiatric co-morbidities, a functionally significant gait disorder, hearing deficits, and a variety of types of tremor. The tremor has been shown to be progressive in nature and quite disabling for a large number of sufferers. Also, recent clinical-epidemiological studies have linked prevalent ET to other neurodegenerative diseases and at least one study has demonstrated an increased risk of mortality in an ET cohort. While many of these studies are derived from clinic-based samples, population-based studies have also substantiated these findings, suggesting that even in the general population, the disease is associated with disability and with co-morbidity. Based on these available studies, it would seem inaccurate to append the word "benign" to ET. Not unlike the word "essential" itself, the word "benign" is an antiquated and outdated term that reflects an era where little was understood about ET. Historically, the general doctors who frequently encountered the disorder would educate patients that it was a benign, non-progressive condition not associated with any co-morbidity or risk of long-term worry. This notion, conceived by prior generations of physicians, is now known to be inaccurate. It is therefore our recommendation that the medical community open the dialog to consider formally discontinuing this nosology ("benign essential tremor") and to adopt the use of the term "essential tremor." Use of the word "benign" is a mischaracterization of the disease course, and could be prove misleading especially in the evolving doctor-patient relationship. In those cases with currently-mild tremor, the nosology "mild essential tremor" would be a more accurate reflection of disease.
24748992<<>>Loss<<>>Developing a Model of the Benefits and Burdens of Research Participation in Cancer Clinical Trials.<<>>BACKGROUND: Recruiting and retaining human participants in cancer clinical trials is challenging for many investigators. Although we expect participants to identify and weigh the benefits and burdens of research participation for themselves, it is not clear what burdens adult cancer participants perceive in relation to benefits. We identify key attributes and develop an initial conceptual framework of benefit and burden based on interviews with individuals enrolled in cancer clinical research. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 32 patients enrolled in cancer clinical trials at a large northeastern cancer center. Krueger's guidelines for qualitative methodology were followed. RESULTS: Respondents reported a range of benefits and burdens associated with research participation. Benefits such as access to needed medications that subjects otherwise might not be able to afford, early detection and monitoring of the disease, potential for remission or cure, and the ability to take control of their lives through actively participating in the trial were identified. Burdens included the potentiality of side effects, worry and fear of the unknown, loss of job support, and financial concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Both benefit and burden influence research participation, including recruitment and retention in clinical trials. Dimensions of benefit and burden include physical, psychological, economic, familial, and social. Understanding the benefit-burden balance involved in the voluntary consent of human subjects is a fundamental tenet of research and important to ensure that subjects have made an informed decision regarding their decision to participate in clinical research.
20803202<<>>Loss<<>>Derivation of a T2-weighted MRI total colonic inflammation score (TCIS) for assessment of patients with severe acute inflammatory colitis-a preliminary study.<<>>OBJECTIVE: To derive an MRI score for assessing severity, therapeutic response and prognosis in acute severe inflammatory colitis. METHODS: Twenty-one patients with acute severe colitis underwent colonic MRI after admission and again (n = 16) after median 5 days of treatment. Using T2-weighted images, two radiologists in consensus graded segmental haustral loss, mesenteric and mural oedema, mural thickness, and small bowel and colonic dilatation producing a total colonic inflammatory score (TCIS, range 6-95). Pre- and post-treatment TCIS were compared, and correlated with CRP, stool frequency, and number of inpatient days (therapeutic response marker). Questionnaire assessment of patient worry, satisfaction and discomfort graded 1 (bad) to 7 (good) was administered RESULTS: Admission TCIS correlated significantly with CRP (Kendall's tau=0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.11-0.79, p = 0.006), and stool frequency (Kendall's tau 0.39, 95% CI 0.14-0.64, p = 0.02). TCIS fell after treatment (median [22 range 15-31]) to median 20 [range 8-25], p = 0.01. Admission TCIS but not CRP or stool frequency was correlated with length of inpatient stay (Kendall's tau 0.40, 95% CI 0.11-0.69, p = 0.02). Patients reported some discomfort (median score 4) during MRI. CONCLUSIONS: MRI TCIS falls after therapy, correlates with existing markers of disease severity, and in comparison may better predict therapeutic response.
22464284<<>>Loss<<>>Minimising phosphorus losses from the soil matrix.<<>>Phosphorus loss from land, due to agricultural intensification, can impair water quality. The quantity lost is a function of runoff and availability, which is affected by inputs and the ability of the soil to retain P. Losses are exacerbated if surface runoff or drainage occurs soon after P inputs (e.g. fertiliser and/or manure and dung). Strategies to mitigate P losses depend on the farming system. The first step is to maintain a farm P balance (inputs-outputs) close to zero and the agronomic optimum. The next step is to use mitigation strategies in areas that lose the most P, but occupy little of the farm or catchment's area. Focusing on these areas, termed critical source areas, is more cost-effective than farm or catchment-wide strategies. However, the worry is that mitigation strategies may not keep pace with losses due to increasing intensification. Therefore, a proactive approach is needed that identifies areas resilient to P inputs and unlikely to lose P if land use is intensified.
28856721<<>>Loss<<>>Focus group study to identify the central facets of fear of hypoglycaemia in people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.<<>>AIMS: To determine key worries about hypoglycaemia among insulin-using adults with Type 2 diabetes using a focus group approach. METHODS: Thirteen focus groups were conducted in three diabetes outpatient care units and one peer support group was set up, in Germany. A total of 64 insulin-dependent adults with Type 2 diabetes (36.5% women, mean age 65.2 +/- 11.0 years) discussed their worries about hypoglycaemia. The qualitative results were assigned into thematic categories using a bottom-up coding procedure. Participants completed the Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey and demographic measures were recorded. The results of the Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey were contrasted with the focus group findings to evaluate how accurately the Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey comprehensively captures features of fear of hypoglycaemia in Type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: Eight themes were identified: 'unconsciousness/death'; 'aloneness/ helplessness', 'fear of hurting somebody'; 'shame'; 'loss of physical control'; 'long-term complications'; 'diabetes self-management issues'; and 'impaired awareness'. A total of 30 participants (46.9%) scored >/=3 on at least one item of the Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey worry subscale, indicating elevated worries. The Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey comprehensively captured all identified themes. Self-efficacy with regard to diabetes self-management seemed to play an important role in fear of hypoglycaemia in Type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Given that even subclinical worries can have negative effects on quality of life and diabetes self-management, emphasis should be placed on diabetes education; in particular, to help patients to develop self-efficacy concerning diabetes self-management. The Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey comprehensively captures hypoglycaemia worries in Type 2 diabetes. Additional assessment of self-efficacy might be beneficial to identify people at risk of developing hypoglycaemia worries.
27637486<<>>Loss<<>>Symptoms and Functional Limitations in the First Year Following a Myocardial Infarction: A Qualitative Study.<<>>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This qualitative interview study was designed to highlight the symptoms and functional limitations experienced by patients in the year following a myocardial infarction (MI). This information can support the use or development of patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments in the post-MI population. METHODS: Individual face-to-face interviews were conducted with 38 participants who had experienced an MI (with or without ST segment elevation) within the past month to <6 months (n = 17), or 6 months to </=12 months (n = 21). Using content and thematic analysis, patient reports of symptoms and functional limitations were coded and then grouped into categories. The specific content and frequency of the symptom and functional limitation reports were summarized. RESULTS: Nearly half of all symptom expressions were related to fatigue. Within this fatigue category, patients reported experiencing general tiredness, as well as a loss of physical energy, mental energy, and/or motivation. Chest pain and discomfort, sleep disruption, and shortness of breath were also frequently reported. Additionally, patients reported emotional effects, including worry and depression, as well as a negative impact on relationships and social activities. CONCLUSIONS: Patients reported a wide variety of symptoms and functional limitations after an MI. Fatigue was the most commonly reported symptom and included several specific dimensions related to tiredness. Consideration of these concepts associated with the patient's experience following an MI may yield novel endpoints for use in clinical trials and better therapies.
18085072<<>>Loss<<>>Lifestyles, flying and associated health problems in flight attendants.<<>>AIMS: This study was conducted in order to investigate the effect of flying on Indian male and female flight attendants (FAs), flying for over 10 years and up to 30 years. METHODS: The FAs selected for this study were subjected to the same set of conditions, such as number of hours flown per month and flight routes. Questionnaires were prepared, based on complaints heard on a regular basis, and also after talking to a small sample of FAs. Nearly 100 completed questionnaires were returned, from 500 delivered directly to FAs by post. In addition to this, we met 130 FAs either before their departure or after their arrival and secured completed questionnaires from them, being sure to maintain anonymity. RESULTS: According to this study there are five major problems faced by the FAs: Stress (88.85%). Back pain (72.65%). Loss of memory (67.47%). Headaches (58.42%). Loss of hearing (51.37%). 88.85% of FAs have reported feeling stressed 'often' or 'sometimes'. Many participants felt that if the work environment were more employee-friendly their stress level might come down. Back pain was reported by 72.65% of FAs which, according to them, could be largely remedied by being provided with better equipment and user-friendly galleys. Loss of memory was prevalent in 67.47% of FAs studied. 58.42% of FAs suffer from headaches. Stress, loss of memory and headaches seem to share the same etiology such as hypoxia, jetlag and irregular sleep. Diminished hearing, prevalent in 51.37% of FAs, was not a major cause of worry but was largely perceived as an inconvenience. CONCLUSIONS: These occupational health problems of flight attendants require serious and immediate attention.
22027080<<>>Loss<<>>Behavioral aspects of vestibular rehabilitation.<<>>Behavioral factors are an integral part of the overall morbidity of patients with vertigo, dizziness, and balance disorders. Anxiety, depression, and more importantly, loss of balance confidence and sense of debility and handicap beleaguer patients with acute and chronic vestibular symptoms. Vestibular rehabilitation originated as a physical therapy, but a careful look at its research development and clinical applications show it to be as much, or perhaps more, a behavioral intervention. More patients referred for vestibular rehabilitation require habituation to chronic vestibular symptoms and motion sensitivity than compensation for active peripheral or central vestibular deficits. Vestibular rehabilitation may exert a positive effect on behavioral morbidity, but the benefits are somewhat uneven and do not always correlate with physical improvements. Health anxiety (i.e., excessive worry about the cause and consequences of physical symptoms) is an emerging concept in clinical psychiatry and psychology. It may offer an important key to understanding the debility and handicap experienced by many patients with vestibular symptoms and enhance the ability of vestibular rehabilitation to ameliorate their suffering.
20003516<<>>Loss<<>>An exploration of social determinants of health amongst internally displaced persons in northern Uganda.<<>>Social determinants of health describe the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age and their influence on health. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power and resources at global, national and local levels, which are themselves influenced by policy choices. Armed conflict and forced displacement are important influences on the social determinants of health. There is limited evidence on the social determinants of health of internally displaced persons (IDPs) who have been forced from their homes due to armed conflict but remain within the borders of their country. The aim of this study was to explore the social determinants of overall physical and mental health of IDPs, including the response strategies used by IDPs to support their health needs. Northern Uganda was chosen as a case-study, and 21 face-to-face semi-structured interviews with IDPs were conducted in fifteen IDP camps between November and December 2006.The findings indicated a number of key social determinants. Experiencing traumatic events could cause "over thinking" which in turn could lead to "madness" and physical ailments. Respondents also attributed "over thinking" to the spirit (cen) of a killed person returning to disturb its killer. Other social determinants included overcrowding which affected physical health and contributed to an emotional sense of loss of freedom; and poverty and loss of land which affected physical health from lack of food and income, and mental health because of worry and uncertainty. Respondents also commented on how the conflict and displacement and led to changes in social and cultural norms such as increased "adultery", "defilement", and "thieving". Response strategies included a combination of biopsychosocial health services, traditional practices, religion, family and friends, and isolating.This study supports work exploring the political, environmental, economic, and socio-cultural determinants of health of IDPs. Addressing these determinants is essential to fundamentally improving the overall physical and mental health of IDPs.
19697245<<>>Loss<<>>International case studies of psychosocial ripple effects of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in European countries.<<>>The public is increasingly concerned about risks associated with food. Food-borne diseases can easily mobilize public concerns and create strong emotional, behavioral, and political reactions with significant negative economic and psychosocial outcomes. This was observed in various countries globally experiencing the presence of prion disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). This study highlights case-study material from various countries for key psychosocial impacts such as the public's worry and fear vis-a-vis beef consumption and the loss of confidence and trust in authorities stemming from the occurrence and management of the BSE crisis. These psychosocial impacts and resultant public behavioral responses are presented at a number of levels including individual, family, community, and societal for several European countries, with special emphasis on the UK case study. Given failures to identify the scope of individual concern about prion diseases, and to address these concerns in decision-making processes and risk communication strategies, there remains a need for further systematic research and psychosocial monitoring of the ripple effects of BSE.
22276999<<>>Loss<<>>Communicating to young adults about HPV vaccination: consideration of message framing, motivation, and gender.<<>>This research examines the influence of message framing (gain vs. loss), motivational orientation (approach vs. avoidance), and gender on intentions to receive human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and HPV-/HPV vaccine-related risk perceptions among young adults ages 18-26 years. Results of an experiment show an interaction between message framing and motivational orientation in predicting intentions to receive HPV vaccination. Loss-framed messages are more persuasive than gain-framed messages for avoidance-oriented individuals, whereas both frames are equally effective for approach-oriented individuals. Gender differences in intentions to get HPV vaccination and worry about vaccine safety are found.
17057049<<>>Loss<<>>Outcomes of pharmacist-managed diabetes care services in a community health center.<<>>PURPOSE: The outcomes of pharmacist-managed diabetes care services in a community health center were studied. METHODS: Eligible patients were over age 18 years and had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients were randomly assigned by the clinical pharmacist and nurse to the intervention group (n = 76) or control group (n = 73). Patients in the intervention group were enrolled in a pharmacist-managed diabetes care program. Patients in the control group received the standard diabetes care. The primary endpoint was reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)); secondary outcome measures included weight loss, an improved body mass index, decreased blood pressure, and an improved lipid panel. Quality-of-life measures (health level, satisfaction, impact, worry about disease, and worry about social and vocational issues) were also assessed. RESULTS: Demographic differences between groups were not remarkable. Mean HbA(1c) levels fell significantly (p < 0.05) from baseline to nine months in both groups. A difference of 1.0 was reported between the groups' HbA(1c) levels (95% confidence interval, 0.08-1.78; p < 0.05). Satisfaction level improved from 63.7 to 77.4 in the intervention group, which was significant when compared with the control group, whose satisfaction score improved from 57.0 to 63.4 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who received pharmacist-managed diabetes care demonstrated improved HbA(1c), systolic blood pressure, and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels and quality-of-life measures and met treatment goals more often than patients receiving standard care.
22103803<<>>Loss<<>>Higher-order structure in the trajectories of depression and anxiety following sudden involuntary unemployment.<<>>Recent work on comorbidity finds evidence for hierarchical structure of mood and anxiety disorders and symptoms. This study tests whether a higher-order internalizing factor accounts for variation in depression and anxiety symptom severity and change over time in a sample experiencing a period of major life stress. Data on symptoms of depression, chronic worry, and social anxiety were collected five times across seven months from 426 individuals who had recently lost jobs. Growth models for each type of symptom found significant variation in individual trajectories. Slopes were highly correlated across symptom type, as were intercepts. Multilevel confirmatory factor analyses found evidence for a higher-order internalizing factor for both slopes and intercepts, reflective of comorbidity of depression and anxiety, with the internalizing factor accounting for 54% to 91% of the variance in slopes and intercepts of specific symptom sets, providing evidence for both a general common factor and domain-specific factors characterizing level and change in symptoms. Loadings on the higher order factors differed modestly for men and women, and when comparing African American and White participants, but did not differ by age, education, or history of depression. More distal factors including gender and history of depression were strongly associated with internalizing in the early weeks after job loss, but rates of change in internalizing were associated most strongly with reemployment. Findings suggest that stressors may contribute in different ways to the common internalizing factor as compared to variance in anxiety and depression that is independent of that factor.
18721640<<>>Loss<<>>The impact of pretrauma analogue GAD and posttraumatic emotional reactivity following exposure to the September 11 terrorist attacks: a longitudinal study.<<>>The relation between analogue generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) assessed the day before the events of September 11, 2001 (9/11) and long-term outcome was examined in 44 young adults who were directly exposed the following day to the terrorist attacks in New York City. After controlling for high exposure to the attacks, preattack analogue GAD was associated with greater social and work disability, loss of psychosocial resources, anxiety and mood symptoms, and worry, but not symptoms of posttraumatic stress, assessed 12 months after 9/11. Fear and avoidance of emotions assessed 4 months after 9/11 statistically mediated the relation between preattack analogue GAD and social and work disability, loss of psychosocial support, mood and anxiety symptoms, and worry at 12-month follow-up. Avoidance of emotions 4 months after 9/11 also mediated the relation between preattack analogue GAD and posttraumatic stress symptoms 12 months after 9/11.
25643004<<>>Loss<<>>Psychometric Evaluation of the Ostomy Adjustment Scale in Chinese Cancer Patients With Colostomies.<<>>BACKGROUND: The Ostomy Adjustment Scale (OAS) has been widely used to measure the adjustment to an ostomy. Although the instrument had been used among subjects from various backgrounds, psychometric properties had never been evaluated. OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to test the psychometric properties of the OAS among Chinese colostomy patients, and the secondary aim was to examine the predictors of colostomy adjustment. METHODS: The translated OAS was tested using a convenience sample of 207 colostomy patients from a university-affiliated cancer center in China. RESULTS: The content validity of the OAS was 0.91. Four items were removed during the process of validity and reliability testing. The final Chinese version of the OAS consisted of 30 items (OAS-C-30) with 4 subscales as follows: negative affect, normal functioning, therapy attitude, and life worry. The Cronbach's alpha, the intraclass correlation, and a split-half Spearman-Brown coefficient for the total scale were 0.915, 0.902 and 0.871, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that stoma self-efficacy, stoma acceptance, excessive aerofluxus, constipation, family relationship, and body image loss were the predictors of adjustment among Chinese colostomy patients. CONCLUSION: The OAS-C-30 has been proven to be a valid and reliable measure to assess the adjustment among colostomy patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The OAS-C-30 is a useful instrument to assess and monitor the level of adjustment among patients with permanent colostomies. The identified predictor variables for adjustment also provide insights to clinicians to assist them in planning interventions to facilitate the adjustment of colostomy patients.
25356311<<>>Loss<<>>Examining sexual dysfunction in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer: results of cross-sectional mixed-methods research.<<>>INTRODUCTION: More than 70,000 new cases of bladder cancer are diagnosed in the United States annually; with 75% being non-muscle-invasive (NMIBC). Research examining sexual dysfunction in bladder cancer survivors is limited, and previous studies have focused on cystectomy patients. AIMS: To evaluate the impact of sexual dysfunction on NMIBC survivors. METHODS: Mixed-methods data collection integrated a quantitative survey (Study 1; n = 117) and semi-structured qualitative interviews (Study 2; n = 26) from a non-overlapping sample of NMIBC survivors. We performed descriptive and classification and regression tree (CART) analyses of survey data and qualitative analysis of interviews. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported sexual activity, interest in sex, and physiologic symptoms (e.g., male erectile/ejaculatory difficulties, female vaginal dryness) over the previous 4 weeks; partner communication about sexuality; contamination concerns; illness intrusiveness. RESULTS: Participants in these studies averaged 65 years of age (mean and median) and were male (77%), white (91%), and married (75%). Survey (Study 1) results linked NMIBC treatment to sexual symptoms and relationship issues. Many participants reported sexual inactivity (38.8%). Sexually active participants reported erectile difficulties (60.0%), vaginal dryness (62.5%), and worry about contaminating partner with treatment agents (23.2%). While almost one-half reported the usefulness of talking with partners about sexual function, only one-fifth of participants reported sharing all concerns with their partners. CART analysis supported the importance of communication. One-half of interviewees (Study 2) reported sexual dysfunction. Two-thirds reported negative impacts on their relationships, including perceived loss of intimacy and divorce; over one-third were sexually inactive for fear of contaminating their partner or spreading NMIBC. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors' sexual symptoms may result from NMIBC, comorbidities, or both. These results inform literature and practice by raising awareness about the frequency of symptoms and the impact on NMIBC survivors' intimate relationships. Further work is needed to design symptom management education programs to dispel misinformation about contamination post-treatment and improve quality of life.

26905329<<>>Loss<<>>Health-Related Quality of Life and Sociodemographic Characteristics as Prognostic Indicators of Long-term Survival in Disease-Free Cervical Cancer Survivors.<<>>OBJECTIVES: Health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) issues of cancer patients are considered an important clinical outcome. We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of HRQOL on long-term survival outcomes in disease-free cervical cancer survivors (CCSs). METHODS: The study sample consisted of 860 disease-free CCSs from 6 Korean cancer hospitals recruited for HRQOL survey during 2005 (median time from diagnosis, 5.9 years). Health-related quality-of-life measures included the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and its Cervical Cancer Module (CX24). Survival data were retrieved from the Korean Statistical Office after 6 years from the survey. Health-related quality-of-life domains along with sociodemographic and clinicopathologic variables were analyzed as prognostic factors for survival from the date of survey. RESULTS: During the median follow-up period of 6.3 years after the survey, 30 (3.5%) patients died from all causes. Age, time since diagnosis, and physical activity were independent prognostic factors, which constituted the baseline model along with cancer stage. When HRQOL domains were tested separately against the baseline model, functional scales (physical, role, social, and emotional functioning), global health status, symptom scales (pain and appetite loss), and cervical cancer module items (body image, sexual inactivity, and sexual worry) were significantly associated with survival (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that, in addition to well-known prognostic factors, including age, time since diagnosis, and physical activity, HRQOL scores obtained from disease-free CCSs are associated with survival.
8419717<<>>Loss<<>>Headache to worry about.<<>>The headache to worry about is one that is unique or different from headaches which the patient has suffered in the past. The association with the headache of meningismus or of focal neurologic symptoms of oculoparesis, other cranial nerve palsies, hemiparesis, or loss of consciousness are particularly worrisome, especially if onset is recent and acute. Headaches related to arteritis or vasculitis usually have a slower subacute course but may also produce focal neurologic deficits. For subjects over 50 years old, temporal arteritis is always a consideration and any new type of headache requires testing of the sedimentation rate to rule out this treatable but potentially devastating problem.
22316641<<>>Loss<<>>Diabetes-specific quality of life after a low-carbohydrate and low-fat dietary intervention.<<>>PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to examine the impact of a 12-month weight loss intervention with either a low-carbohydrate or a low-fat diet on quality of life (QOL) among obese patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Participants were enrolled in a randomized trial comparing a low-carbohydrate to a low-fat diet in type 2 diabetes. QOL was assessed with the Diabetes-39 questionnaire, which measures QOL within 5 distinct scales: anxiety and worry, diabetes control, energy and mobility, social burden, and sexual functioning. Repeated measures ANOVA compared change in QOL scales at baseline and 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: Forty-six participants completed all measures. Following 12 months, there was a significant reduction in the scores related to sexual function and energy and mobility, suggesting improvement in QOL related to these domains. These changes were not significantly different between dietary arms. Changes in weight, A1C, and dietary composition were not significantly correlated with changes in QOL. CONCLUSIONS: Participants with diabetes have various options for weight loss. Dietary interventions with either low-carbohydrate or low-fat diets may lead to some improvements in QOL in patients with type 2 diabetes.
26598937<<>>Loss<<>>The Impact of Trachomatous Trichiasis on Quality of Life: A Case Control Study.<<>>BACKGROUND: Trachomatous trichiasis is thought to have a profound effect on quality of life (QoL), however, there is little research in this area. We measured vision and health-related QoL in a case-control study in Amhara Region, Ethiopia. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We recruited 1000 adult trichiasis cases and 200 trichiasis-free controls, matched to every fifth trichiasis case on age (+/- two years), sex and location. Vision-related quality of life (VRQoL) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were measured using the WHO/PBD-VF20 and WHOQOL-BREF questionnaires. Comparisons were made using linear regression adjusted for age, sex and socioeconomic status. Trichiasis cases had substantially lower VRQoL than controls on all subscales (overall eyesight, visual symptom, general functioning and psychosocial, p<0.0001), even in the sub-group with normal vision (p<0.0001). Lower VRQoL scores in cases were associated with longer trichiasis duration, central corneal opacity, visual impairment and poor contrast sensitivity. Trichiasis cases had lower HRQoL in all domains (Physical-health, Psychological, Social, Environment, p<0.0001), lower overall QoL (mean, 34.5 v 64.6; p<0.0001) and overall health satisfaction (mean, 38.2 v 71.7; p<0.0001). This association persisted in a sub-group analysis of cases and controls with normal vision. Not having a marriage partner (p<0.0001), visual impairment (p = 0.0068), daily labouring (p<0.0001), presence of other health problems (p = 0.0018) and low self-rated wealth (p<0.0001) were independently associated with lower overall QoL scores in cases. Among cases, trichiasis caused 596 (59%) to feel embarrassed, 913 (91.3%) to worry they may lose their remaining eyesight and 681 (68.1%) to have sleep disturbance. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Trachomatous trichiasis substantially reduces vision and health related QoL and is disabling, even without visual impairment. Prompt trichiasis intervention is needed both to prevent vision loss and to alleviate physical and psychological suffering, social exclusion and improve overall well-being. Implementation of the full SAFE strategy is needed to prevent the development of trachomatous trichiasis.
26026952<<>>Loss<<>>Concussion in rugby: knowledge and attitudes of players.<<>>BACKGROUND: Concussion is a traumatic brain injury, resulting in the alteration of mental status with or without loss of consciousness. There is increasing awareness that recurrent concussion may contribute to long-term neurological complication. AIMS: To determine player knowledge and attitudes regarding concussion. To identify sources of information and medical care, and to estimate the incidence of concussion in this group. To determine if player gender and grade of competition are associated with differences in knowledge, attitudes, medical care, and incidence. METHODS: Five rugby teams were recruited and players invited to complete a paper-based questionnaire. The questionnaire sought information on player demographics, knowledge level, attitudes and concussion experience. RESULTS: 90.8 % of players knew they should not continue playing when concussed. 75 % of players would continue an important game even if concussed. Of those concussed, 39.1 % have tried to influence medical assessment with 78.2 % stating it is possible or quite easy to do so. Males are less likely to worry about long-term effects of concussion (chi (2) = 9.23, p = 0.026). Club players are less likely to have medical care at training (chi (2) = 28.2, p < 0.001) or matches (chi (2) = 19.47 p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Despite good knowledge of concussion complications, management players engage in unsafe behaviour with little difference between gender and competition grades. Information regarding symptoms and management should be available to all players, coaches, and parents. Provision of medical care should be mandatory at every level of competition.
19647506<<>>Loss<<>>Women's experiences of being induced for post-date pregnancy.<<>>AIM: To explore the women's experiences of being booked for induction of labour for a pregnancy greater than 41 weeks gestation. PARTICIPANTS: 23 primigravidae who were booked for induction: 18 were induced (induction group) and 5 went into spontaneous labour (comparison group). METHOD: Data were collected by a series of interviews from booking to after birthing: interpretative techniques analysed verbatim transcriptions. FINDINGS: Two dimensions of being in the process of induction were identified: (1) a sense of "Time's Up," when the natural, temporal aspects of pregnancy end with an imposed birth date and sequenced induction procedures and, (2) a required "Shift in Expectations" from the women's original plan for labour and birth. The women varied in their responses from welcoming the end of pregnancy to feeling that their body or their baby was not ready for birth. A lack of meaningful information regarding the process of induction was also identified. The comparison group focused their worry on the impact of induction on the baby whereas the induction group expressed concern about the effect on themselves and loss of a natural birth. Worries in both groups were dissipated by successfully birthing a healthy baby. IMPLICATIONS AND OUTCOMES: The findings sensitise midwives to women's possible responses to being booked for induction. Antenatal educators can use this knowledge to prepare women and their partners for required shifts in their birthing plan when induction is deemed necessary. Midwives can help women adapt their birth plans during the induction process.
20063397<<>>Loss<<>>An exploration of the burden experienced by spousal caregivers of individuals with Parkinson's disease.<<>>Although previous research has attempted to identify the needs of caregivers for individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), most has focused on the demands associated with the physical needs of the patient, and not on "mental burden." This study used the repertory grid method to capture the full range of caregivers' subjective experience, quantify their perceptions, and to acquire information that might be useful in directing remediation attempts. Within this sample, caregivers reported far greater burden from "mental stress" (e.g., worrying about individual's safety) than from "physical stress" (e.g., lifting individual into bed). Specifically, caregivers were primarily concerned about spousal safety, as this requires continuous vigilance and constant worry. Caregivers also reported experiencing "little deaths" as the disease progresses, related to a loss of independence for the couple, and the steady diminishment of social networks. Increasing attention on the mental burden experienced by spousal caregivers promises to increase quality of care, and quality of life for individuals with PD, by improving quality of life for the caregiver.
24164549<<>>Loss<<>>The attitude toward xenocorneal transplantation in wait-listed subjects for corneal transplantation in Korea.<<>>Shortage of donor cornea is a significant problem in Asia, and xenocorneal transplantation is being actively studied to alleviate this problem. However, the attitudes of subjects who await corneal transplants toward xenocorneal transplantation are not known at all. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the attitudes of subjects on the waiting lists for corneal transplants, toward corneal xenotransplantation. A telephone questionnaire survey comprising six items was conducted in 132 subjects among the wait-listed individuals (n = 590) who were awaiting corneal transplantation or had undergone corneal transplantation at Seoul National University Hospital from July, 2003 to August, 2012. Among six inquiries, four questions were used to analyze attitudes toward corneal xenotransplantation. Each question pertained to (1) the acceptance of xenocorneal transplantation, (2) willingness to participate in clinical trials, (3) worries in xenocorneal transplantation, and (4) the concern of self-identity or social life after xenocorneal transplantation. To analyze demographic factors influencing the question, the subjects were arbitrarily divided into two groups: the young (age < 60 yr, n = 58) and the elderly (age >/= 60 yr, n = 74) or the less-educated (n = 53) and the well-educated with high school diploma, college graduation, or higher education (n = 79). Collected demographic data were analyzed as influencing factors on each question using a chi-square and logistic regression tests. In this study, 42.4% of the subjects (n = 56) expressed favorable views on xenocorneal transplantation using porcine corneas to cure visual loss from corneal blindness. Among those subjects expressing favorable views (n = 56), the willingness to participate in clinical trials, knowing they and their spouses must undergo long-term surveillance, was 62.5% (n = 35). There were 76.5% of subjects (n = 101) expressing worries regarding xenocorneal transplantation, while 28.8% of subjects (n = 38) expressed their concerns about self-identity or social life after xenotransplantation. Younger subjects expressed more worry about xenotransplantation than elderly subjects. The well-educated expressed less concern over self-identity and social life than the less-educated. This survey among subjects who are wait-listed for corneal transplant or who have received a corneal transplant demonstrates that there is an interest in xenocorneal transplantation as an alternate procedure, although there are worries about the procedure that should be further explored in educational campaigns and future studies of the general population.
20220670<<>>Loss<<>>In sickness and in health: experience of caring for a spouse with MS.<<>>BACKGROUND People are not expected to die from multiple sclerosis although, as the condition progresses over a period of time, some people become increasingly disabled and will require assistance with all activities of daily living. Their partners invariably carry out these tasks. OBJECTIVE To gain a deeper understanding of the experiences of the partner living with and caring for a spouse disabled by multiple sclerosis. METHODOLOGY In a qualitative study, eight partners who live and care for a person with multiple sclerosis were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire to explore their experience of their role. RESULTS The interview transcripts were analyzed using a thematic framework approach. Codes, themes and five categories were identified, which were worry, planning, frustrations, commitment to marriage and coping strategies. These categories were examined using quotes from the transcripts as evidence. CONCLUSION This qualitative study identified that these couples had been married for at least 20 years before disability of the spouse significantly affected their lifestyle. Partners felt obliged to continue in their caring role due to a sense of duty and commitment of marriage. Partners felt a sense of loss as they prioritized the health and needs of their spouse above their own and, finally, partners lost their identity as husband/wife as they were called 'the carer'. Partners felt out of control due to the unpredictable and progressive nature of MS and because it consumed their life 24 hours every day. Partners often felt guilty at not being satisfied with their life and wanting some independence.
22683166<<>>Loss<<>>Quality of life characteristics inpatients with cervical cancer.<<>>AIM: Annually about 500,000 women worldwide are diagnosed with cervical cancer. For many patients, young age at the time of diagnosis and a good prognosis regarding the disease imply a long life with the side-effects and sequels of various treatment options. The present study investigated the extent to which different quality of life (QoL) domains in patients during and after treatment for cervical cancer are affected according to menopausal status, treatment status and treatment modality. METHODS: QoL data from 346 cervical cancer patients from 14 countries who were included in a cervical cancer module validation study of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of life Group were analysed according to menopausal status, treatment status and treatment modality. QOL was assessed using the EORTC Quality of life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 and the QLQ-CX24 module. Statistical analyses were performed using descriptive statistics and analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Active treatment had the strongest negative impact on 13 different QoL domains: physical, role, emotional, cognitive, social functioning, global health/QoL, fatigue, nausea and emesis, pain, appetite loss, constipation, symptom experience and sexual enjoyment. Irradiation alone +/- other therapy was associated with most symptoms of diarrhoea. Age had the most negative impact on sexual activity and the strongest positive effect on sexual worry. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that patients with cervical carcinoma had different side-effects with different impacts on QOL depending on the menopausal status and therapy modalities. Patients should be informed about the possibility that therapy may have a negative impact on QoL.
25006191<<>>Loss<<>>Recommended patient-reported core set of symptoms to measure in adult cancer treatment trials.<<>>BACKGROUND: The National Cancer Institute's Symptom Management and Health-Related Quality of Life Steering Committee held a clinical trials planning meeting (September 2011) to identify a core symptom set to be assessed across oncology trials for the purposes of better understanding treatment efficacy and toxicity and to facilitate cross-study comparisons. We report the results of an evidence-synthesis and consensus-building effort that culminated in recommendations for core symptoms to be measured in adult cancer clinical trials that include a patient-reported outcome (PRO). METHODS: We used a data-driven, consensus-building process. A panel of experts, including patient representatives, conducted a systematic review of the literature (2001-2011) and analyzed six large datasets. Results were reviewed at a multistakeholder meeting, and a final set was derived emphasizing symptom prevalence across diverse cancer populations, impact on health outcomes and quality of life, and attribution to either disease or anticancer treatment. RESULTS: We recommend that a core set of 12 symptoms--specifically fatigue, insomnia, pain, anorexia (appetite loss), dyspnea, cognitive problems, anxiety (includes worry), nausea, depression (includes sadness), sensory neuropathy, constipation, and diarrhea--be considered for inclusion in clinical trials where a PRO is measured. Inclusion of symptoms and other patient-reported endpoints should be well justified, hypothesis driven, and meaningful to patients. CONCLUSIONS: This core set will promote consistent assessment of common and clinically relevant disease- and treatment-related symptoms across cancer trials. As such, it provides a foundation to support data harmonization and continued efforts to enhance measurement of patient-centered outcomes in cancer clinical trials and observational studies.
30958101<<>>Loss<<>>Predicting Colorectal Cancer Screening among Adults Who Have Never Been Screened: Testing the Interaction between Message Framing and Tailored Risk Feedback.<<>>Providing adults tailored risk estimates of getting colorectal cancer (CRC) can increase screening. A concern is that receipt of lower risk estimates will demotivate screening; this effect may be curbed by matching level of risk with message framing. Theoretically, pairing lower risk estimates with gain-frame messages, and higher risk estimates with loss-frame messages, should increase screening and screening intentions more than pairing lower risk estimates with loss-frame messages/higher risk estimates with gain-frame messages. These effects may be mediated by how screening is construed (e.g., to find health problems vs. to reaffirm one is healthy). These predictions were tested experimentally among 560 men and women ages 50-75 who have never screened. Participants at baseline received online a tailored comparative risk estimate with gain- or loss-frame information on screening. Screening was assessed six months later. Among the 400 reached at six months, 9.5% reported screening. There were no main effects or interactions between risk feedback and framing predicting construals, screening intentions, or screening. Worry about getting CRC and screening intentions predicted screening. While hypothesized interactions were not found, future research should explore further mechanisms through which online interventions utilizing risk feedback and framing motivate screening among adults who have never screened.
16600981<<>>Loss<<>>Experience of parental cancer in childhood is a risk factor for psychological distress during genetic cancer susceptibility testing.<<>>BACKGROUND: This study explores the effect of age at the time of parental cancer diagnosis or death on psychological distress and cancer risk perception in individuals undergoing genetic testing for a specific cancer susceptibility. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cancer-related distress, worry and risk perception were assessed in 271 applicants for genetic testing of an identified mutation in BRCA1/2 (BReast CAncer) or a HNPCC (Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer) related gene before, one week after, and six months after genetic test disclosure. The course of distress and risk perception were compared between individuals having witnessed parental cancer or loss due to cancer in childhood, adolescence, adulthood and having unaffected parents. RESULTS: Individuals with parental cancer in childhood (under age 13) reported the highest level of cancer related distress, worry and risk perception. Women having their mother affected by breast cancer in puberty (aged 10-13 years) perceived higher breast cancer risks than women with an affected mother in adulthood or without an affected mother. Individuals with an affected parent perceived cancer risks as higher than individuals without an affected parent, but were not more distressed. CONCLUSIONS: Experience of parental cancer in childhood is a risk factor for psychological distress during the genetic testing process.
24973486<<>>Loss<<>>Waiting for a specialist consultation for a new condition in Ontario: impacts on patients' lives.<<>>As leading barriers to specialist care, wait times are at the forefront of the Canadian healthcare policy agenda. However, knowledge is limited about how wait times affect patients' lives. We utilized the 2010 Canadian Community Health Survey to examine the experience of patients requiring a consultation with a medical specialist for a new condition. Multivariate logistic regression predicted the likelihood that a respondent self-reported his or her life was affected. Subsequent cross-tabulations determined the ways in which life was affected. Females, middle-aged respondents, new immigrants and those with low income and poor health status were more likely to report their life was affected. Worry, stress and anxiety were the most frequently reported impacts, followed by pain, stress on family/friends, deterioration of health and loss of work. Our research demonstrates a need to address the impacts of wait times on health and well-being, with a focus on particular subpopulation groups.
27896390<<>>Loss<<>>[Assisted suicide in the movies - what is (not) shown?]<<>>Whereas changes to the existing legal situation regarding assisted suicide have been a topic of controversial debate in Germany for the last few years, this issue has long been of interest for international film-makers. Since the mid-1980s, the theme of assisted suicide has repeatedly been taken up by cinema, predominantly as central to a relationship drama. A sick person asks somebody close to them for help. Often this somebody is a physician or a nurse, ultimately an obvious way of solving the practical problem of how the assistant is to gain access to a lethal substance. At the same time, this constellation enables a physician or nurse to be forced into a dramatic conflict between professional ethics and a personal obligation towards a loved one.Alongside more classic clinical pictures such as terminal cancer, recent films about assisted suicide have featured neurodegenerative diseases and physical disabilities. Another new development is that elderly patients are no longer alone in requesting assistance; films also and increasingly portray young adults. Besides a fear of unbearable pain, more recent films have also increasingly addressed the worry that permanent nursing might be required, as well as the subjectively experienced loss of dignity. The possibilities offered by palliative care hardly play a role in feature films. However, we should not forget, that movies are fictional and orchestrated, or, in other words, they are neither educational nor documental. They neither need nor want to portray reality, although they do wish to draw upon real experiences. They exploit highly emotional and ethically controversial themes to create tensions and stir up emotions in the audience, but ultimately they seek to entertain. Movies about death and dying are always "die-tainment".
19968725<<>>Loss<<>>Transformational experiences in adult-to-adult living-donor liver transplant recipients.<<>>AIM: This paper is a report of a study conducted to explore the transformational experiences of adult-to-adult living-donor liver transplant recipients. BACKGROUND: Living-donor liver transplant was developed to overcome the shortage of cadaveric livers available for transplantation. However, living-donor liver transplant generates multifaceted psychosocial problems for recipients. METHOD: Data were collected from 2002 to 2004 through in-depth interviews and participant observations. We adopted a phenomenological approach that examined the experience of 30 recipients. FINDINGS: We classified the experiences into three types: common, innate and unrealized. Analysis of the transcripts revealed four themes, all with associated sub-themes. The first theme, guilt and concrete issues, includes anguish when thinking about survival by hurting a potential donor and problems associated with donor and cost. The second theme, let it happen includes leave it to fate; ambivalence; and worry about the donor candidate and whether he/she will change their mind. The third theme, pain, includes extreme physical and mental pain for me and the donor; and worry about cost. The fourth theme, balancing gains and losses, includes grateful for and hoping to enjoy my new life; burden of new body; difficulty in adapting to modified life plan; and changes in family relationships. CONCLUSION: Nursing practice should be developed to (1) give support to patients and their families during decision-making; (2) give support for the dramatic life change; (3) help recipients accept the reality of the transplant; and (4) help achieve the essential balance between feelings of attainment and loss.
21933393<<>>Loss<<>>A validity-driven approach to the understanding of the personal and societal burden of low back pain: development of a conceptual and measurement model.<<>>INTRODUCTION: While the importance and magnitude of the burden of low back pain upon the individual is well recognized, a systematic understanding of the impact of the condition on individuals is currently hampered by the lack of an organized understanding of what aspects of a person's life are affected and the lack of comprehensive measures for these effects. The aim of the present study was to develop a conceptual and measurement model of the overall burden of low back pain from the individual's perspective using a validity-driven approach. METHODS: To define the breadth of low back pain burden we conducted three concept-mapping workshops to generate an item pool. Two face-to-face workshops (Australia) were conducted with people with low back pain and clinicians and policy-makers, respectively. A third workshop (USA) was held with international multidisciplinary experts. Multidimensional scaling, cluster analysis, participant input and thematic analyses organized participants' ideas into clusters of ideas that then informed the conceptual model. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-nine statements were generated. Considerable overlap was observed between groups, and four major clusters were observed--Psychosocial, Physical, Treatment and Employment--each with between two and six subclusters. Content analysis revealed that elements of the Psychosocial cluster were sufficiently distinct to be split into Psychological and Social, and a further cluster of elements termed Positive Effects also emerged. Finally, a hypothesized structure was proposed with six domains and 16 subdomains. New domains not previously considered in the back pain field emerged for psychometric verification: loss of independence, worry about the future, and negative or discriminatory actions by others. CONCLUSIONS: Using a grounded approach, an explicit a priori and testable model of the overall burden of low back pain has been proposed that captures the full breadth of the burden experienced by patients and observed by experts.
22396683<<>>Loss<<>>Development and validation of a screening scale for depression in Korea: the Lee and Rhee Depression Scale.<<>>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a culturally sensitive instrument that addressed how individuals express and experience depression to detect this disorder in Koreans. We also assessed the validity, reliability, and diagnostic utility of this scale (Lee and Rhee Depression Scale; LRDS). METHODS: The sample consisted of 3,697 normal adults selected from 12 administrative districts (Do) and 448 Korean patients diagnosed with depression using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders (SCID-I). Reliability was calculated using Cronbach's alpha. Construct validity, discriminant validity, and concurrent validity were also measured. Receiver-operator-characteristic (ROC) analysis was employed to evaluate diagnostic efficiency. RESULTS: The LRDS was found to be a reliable instrument (Cronbach's alpha=0.95) consisting of six factors: negative thinking about the future, negative thinking about the self, worry and agitation, depressed mood, somatization, and loss of volition. Comparison of LRDS scores discriminated the group of patients with depression from the normal individuals in the control group. The measure showed good concurrent validity in that scores were significantly and strongly correlated with scores on established scales such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), and the D scale of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-second edition (MMPI-2). Diagnostic efficiency was 77.7%, and the cut-off scores were 65 for males and 70 for females. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to develop a depression-screening scale on the basis of Korean patients' complaints about the disorder. As a culturally sensitive tool, the LRDS will be useful in clinical and research settings in Korea.

21073775<<>>Loss<<>>Perceptions of emergency medicine residents and fellows regarding competence, adverse events and reporting to supervisors: a national survey.<<>>OBJECTIVE: We sought to characterize the perceptions of emergency medicine (EM) residents and fellows of their clinical and procedural competence, as well as their attitudes, practices and perceived barriers to reporting these perceptions to their supervisors. METHODS: A Web-based survey was distributed to residents and fellows, via their residency directors, in all Canadian EM residency programs outside of Quebec. RESULTS: Of 220 residents and fellows contacted in 9 of 10 EM programs of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and 12 of 13 EM programs of The College of Family Physicians of Canada, 82 (37.3%) completed all or part of the survey. Response rates varied slightly by question; 25 of 82 re-spondents (30.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 19.9%-41.1%]) agreed with the statement, "I sometimes feel unsafe or un-qualified with undertaking unsupervised responsibilities or procedures, but I do not report this to my senior physician" and 32 of 81 (39.5% [95% CI 28.2%-50.8%]) had felt this within the past 6 months. Moreover, 34 of 82 (41.5% [95% CI 30.2%-52.7%]) reported their lack of competence to a supervisor half the time or less. Trainees reported worry about loss of trust, autonomy or respect (38/80, 47.5% [95% CI 35.9%-59.1%]) or reputation (32/80, 40.0% [95% CI 28.6%-51.4%]). Nights on-call (30/79, 38% [95% CI 26.6%-49.3%]), admission decisions (13/79, 16.5% [7.6%-25.3%]) and central line insertion (13/79, 16.5% [95% CI 7.6%-25.3%]) were reported to be frequently undertaken despite not feeling competent. Suggestions to improve reporting included encouragement to report without penalty (41/82, 50.0% [95% CI 38.6%-61.4%]) and a less judgmental environment (32/82, 39.0% [95% CI 27.9%-50.2%]). CONCLUSION: Emergency medicine trainees report that they frequently do not feel competent when undertaking responsibilities without supervision. Barriers to reporting these feelings or reporting adverse events appear to relate to social pressures and authority gradients. Modifications to the training culture are encouraged to improve patient safety.
24282148<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Threat-related attentional bias in anorexia nervosa.<<>>OBJECTIVE: Attentional bias (AB) modification treatment targeting general or social anxiety has been recently highlighted as a potential novel approach for the treatment of anorexia nervosa (AN). The purpose of this study was to examine threat-related AB in patients with ANand healthy control participants (HC) and the relationship between AB and eating disorder and other psychopathology. METHOD: Forty-nine female outpatients with AN or Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, Anorexia Type (EDNOS-AN), and 44 female HC completed a dot-probe task with threat words and a range of self-report measures assessing eating disorder symptoms and other psychopathology. RESULTS: There was no evidence for a differential threat-related AB in AN patients despite elevated anxiety in this group. The AB-index, a parameter of the magnitude of attention allocation when two competing stimuli are presented, did not correlate with any of the self-report measures. However, patients with AN responded significantly more slowly to the probe as compared to controls, regardless of the valence or position of the stimuli. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that the AB in AN patients may be specific to eating disorder-relevant anxieties.
29781628<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Early life stress impairs contextual threat expression in female, but not male, mice.<<>>Early life stress (ELS) is associated with altered processing of threat signals, and increased lifetime risk of anxiety and affective pathology, disorders that disproportionately affect females. We tested the impact of a limited bedding paradigm of ELS (from P4-11) on contextual threat learning, context memory, footshock sensitivity, and anxietylike behavior, in adult male and female mice. To examine contextual threat learning, mice conditioned by context/footshock association were tested 24 hr later for the context memory. To determine the effect of ELS on footshock sensitivity, a separate cohort of mice were exposed to footshocks of increasing intensity (0.06 to 0.40 mA) and behavioral responses (jump and audible vocalization) were assessed by observers blind to treatment condition, sex, and cycle stage. ELS impaired context memory in female, but not male, mice. ELS increased footshock-induced threshold to vocalize, but not to jump, in both sexes. In female mice, this effect was most apparent during estrus. Decreased body weight, indicative of higher stress incurred by an individual mouse, correlated with increased threshold to jump in both sexes reared in ELS, and to audibly vocalize in ELS females. As ELS effects on shock sensitivity were present in both sexes, the contextual recall deficit in females was not likely driven by changes in the salience of aversive footshocks. No effects on anxietylike behavior, as measured in the elevated plus maze (EPM), were observed. More work is needed to better understand the impact of ELS on both somatic and gonadal development, and their potential contribution to threat learning. (PsycINFO Database Record
29397080<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Distinct Associations Between Low Positive Affect, Panic, and Neural Responses to Reward and Threat During Late Stages of Affective Picture Processing.<<>>BACKGROUND: Abnormal patterns of attention to threat and reward have been proposed as potential mechanisms of dysfunction in anxiety and mood disorders. However, research on this topic has been inconsistent, perhaps because of both clinical heterogeneity in the samples assessed and measurement of attentional biases that is temporally imprecise. METHODS: The present study measured transdiagnostic symptoms of anxiety and depression in 205 young adults and recorded affect-modulated event-related potentials in response to task-irrelevant pictures in a speeded response task. RESULTS: Low positive affect was uniquely associated with reduced modulation of later event-related potentials (i.e., the P300 and the late positive potential) by rewarding images, suggesting deficits in sustained attention to reward. Low positive affect was also associated with a blunted threat-elicited late positive potential. Symptoms of panic were associated with an increased N1 to rewarding images, as well as an increased late positive potential to all picture types. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that dysfunction in neural markers of sustained attention to threat and reward relate in specific ways to transdiagnostic symptom dimensions of anxiety and depression. Moreover, event-related potentials are likely to be useful in investigations of the time course of attentional abnormalities associated with these symptom dimensions.
24131552<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Perturbed threat monitoring following a traumatic event predicts risk for post-traumatic stress disorder.<<>>BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and difficult to treat psychiatric disorder. Objective, performance-based diagnostic markers that uniquely index risk for PTSD above and beyond subjective self-report markers could inform attempts to improve prevention and early intervention. We evaluated the predictive value of threat-related attention bias measured immediately after a potentially traumatic event, as a risk marker for PTSD at a 3-month follow-up. We measured the predictive contribution of attentional threat bias above and beyond that of the more established marker of risk for PTSD, self-reported psychological dissociation. METHOD: Dissociation symptoms and threat-related attention bias were measured in 577 motor vehicle accident (MVA) survivors (mean age = 35.02 years, 356 males) within 24 h of admission to an emergency department (ED) of a large urban hospital. PTSD symptoms were assessed at a 3-month follow-up using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). RESULTS: Self-reported dissociation symptoms significantly accounted for 16% of the variance in PTSD at follow-up, and attention bias toward threat significantly accounted for an additional 4% of the variance in PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: Threat-related attention bias can be reliably measured in the context of a hospital ED and significantly predicts risk for later PTSD. Possible mechanisms underlying the association between threat bias following a potentially traumatic event and risk for PTSD are discussed. The potential application of an attention bias modification treatment (ABMT) tailored to reduce risk for PTSD is suggested.
28867935<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>The history of generalized anxiety disorder as a diagnostic category.<<>>From the 19th century into the 20th century, the terms used to diagnose generalized anxiety included "pantophobia" and "anxiety neurosis." Such terms designated paroxysmal manifestations (panic attacks) as well as interparoxysmal phenomenology (the apprehensive mental state). Also, generalized anxiety was considered one of numerous symptoms of neurasthenia, a vaguely defined illness. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) appeared as a diagnostic category in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) in 1980, when anxiety neurosis was split into GAD and panic disorder. The distinct responses these two disorders had to imipramine therapy was one reason to distinguish between the two. Since the revised DSM-III (DSM-III-R), worry about a number of life circumstances has been gradually emphasized as the distinctive symptom of GAD. Thus, a cognitive aspect of anxiety has become the core criterion of GAD. The validity of GAD as an independent category has been questioned from DSM-III up to preparation of DSM-5. Areas of concern have included the difficulty to establish clear boundaries between GAD and (i) personality dimensions, (ii) other anxiety-spectrum disorders, and (iii) nonbipolar depression. The National Institute of Mental Health has recently proposed the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), a framework destined to facilitate biological research into the etiology of mental symptoms. Within the RDoC framework, generalized anxiety might be studied as a dimension denominated "anxious apprehension" that would typically fit into the research domain called "negative valence systems" and the more specific construct termed "potential threat."
25134736<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Interpersonal motives and social-evaluative threat: Effects of acceptance and status stressors on cardiovascular reactivity and salivary cortisol response.<<>>Social-evaluative threat evokes increases in salivary cortisol and heightened cardiovascular reactivity. However, the types or content of social threats underlying these physiological responses are not clearly delineated in direct comparisons. Based in interpersonal theory, the present study manipulated high and low levels of acceptance threat (i.e., evaluation of likability, potential for inclusion) and status threat (i.e., evaluation of competence, leadership potential) during a modified Trier Social Stress Test, using a sample of 137 undergraduates (73 women). Both acceptance threat and status threat heightened salivary cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure responses to the task. Hence, concerns about social inclusion or connection with others and concerns about social standing or status can contribute independently to physiological stress responses.
25777789<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Episodic foresight and anxiety: Proximate and ultimate perspectives.<<>>OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we examine the relationship between episodic foresight and anxiety from an evolutionary perspective, proposing that together they confer an advantage for modifying present moment decision-making and behaviour in the light of potential future threats to fitness. METHODS: We review the body of literature on the role of episodic foresight in anxiety, from both proximate and ultimate perspectives. RESULTS: We propose that anxious feelings associated with episodic simulation of possible threat-related future events serve to imbue these simulations with motivational currency. Episodic and semantic details of a future threat may be insufficient for motivating its avoidance, but anxiety associated with a simulation can provoke adaptive threat management. As such, we detail how anxiety triggered by a self-generated, threat-related future simulation prepares the individual to manage that threat (in terms of its likelihood and/or consequences) over greater temporal distances than observed in other animals. We then outline how anxiety subtypes may represent specific mechanisms for predicting and managing particular classes of fitness threats. CONCLUSIONS: This approach offers an inroad for understanding the nature of characteristic future thinking patterns in anxiety disorders and serves to illustrate the adaptive function of the mechanism from which clinical anxiety deviates.
26459841<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>The Effects of Safety Behavior Directed Towards a Safety Cue on Perceptions of Threat.<<>>Safety behavior involves precautions to prevent or minimize a feared outcome, and is involved in the maintenance of anxiety disorders. Earlier research has shown that safety behavior prevents the extinction of conditioned fear and maintains threat expectations. This study tested whether safety behavior directed towards an objectively safe stimulus increases the perceived threat of that stimulus when it is subsequently experienced in the absence of the safety measure. In a conditioning task, participants first learned that one "danger" cue (A) was followed by shock and two "safety" cues (B, C) were not. Then they learned to apply safety behavior during A trials, which prevented the shock. Next, the experimental group, and not the control group, was given the opportunity to display safety behavior to C trials, which had never been coupled with the shock. In a subsequent test phase, A, B, and C were presented without the opportunity for participants to engage in safety behavior. Results showed that safety behavior increased shock expectancy to C in the test phase and maintained a preexisting shock expectancy in the experimental group, but not in the control group. This is the first study to show that safety behavior can maintain threat appraisal to stimuli that only ever acquired threat indirectly. This may be a possible mechanism for the origin of biased threat beliefs, superstitious behaviors, and irrational fears. It is also practically relevant: safety behavior reduces actual danger, but in relatively safe situations, its potential costs may outweigh the benefits.
25179230<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Mathematical anxiety is linked to reduced cognitive reflection: a potential road from discomfort in the mathematics classroom to susceptibility to biases.<<>>BACKGROUND: When asked to solve mathematical problems, some people experience anxiety and threat, which can lead to impaired mathematical performance (Curr Dir Psychol Sci 11:181-185, 2002). The present studies investigated the link between mathematical anxiety and performance on the cognitive reflection test (CRT; J Econ Perspect 19:25-42, 2005). The CRT is a measure of a person's ability to resist intuitive response tendencies, and it correlates strongly with important real-life outcomes, such as time preferences, risk-taking, and rational thinking. METHODS: In Experiments 1 and 2 the relationships between maths anxiety, mathematical knowledge/mathematical achievement, test anxiety and cognitive reflection were analysed using mediation analyses. Experiment 3 included a manipulation of working memory load. The effects of anxiety and working memory load were analysed using ANOVAs. RESULTS: Our experiments with university students (Experiments 1 and 3) and secondary school students (Experiment 2) demonstrated that mathematical anxiety was a significant predictor of cognitive reflection, even after controlling for the effects of general mathematical knowledge (in Experiment 1), school mathematical achievement (in Experiment 2) and test anxiety (in Experiments 1-3). Furthermore, Experiment 3 showed that mathematical anxiety and burdening working memory resources with a secondary task had similar effects on cognitive reflection. CONCLUSIONS: Given earlier findings that showed a close link between cognitive reflection, unbiased decisions and rationality, our results suggest that mathematical anxiety might be negatively related to individuals' ability to make advantageous choices and good decisions.
30054732<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Oxytocin facilitates adaptive fear and attenuates anxiety responses in animal models and human studies-potential interaction with the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST).<<>>Despite its relatively well-understood role as a reproductive and pro-social peptide, oxytocin (OT) tells a more convoluted story in terms of its modulation of fear and anxiety. This nuanced story has been obscured by a great deal of research into the therapeutic applications of exogenous OT, driving more than 400 ongoing clinical trials. Drawing from animal models and human studies, we review the complex evidence concerning OT's role in fear learning and anxiety, clarifying the existing confusion about modulation of fear versus anxiety. We discuss animal models and human studies demonstrating the prevailing role of OT in strengthening fear memory to a discrete signal or cue, which allows accurate and rapid threat detection that facilitates survival. We also review ostensibly contrasting behavioral studies that nonetheless provide compelling evidence of OT attenuating sustained contextual fear and anxiety-like behavior, arguing that these OT effects on the modulation of fear vs. anxiety are not mutually exclusive. To disambiguate how endogenous OT modulates fear and anxiety, an understudied area compared to exogenous OT, we survey behavioral studies utilizing OT receptor (OTR) antagonists. Based on emerging evidence about the role of OTR in rat dorsolateral bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) and elsewhere, we postulate that OT plays a critical role in facilitating accurate discrimination between stimuli representing threat and safety. Supported by human studies, we demonstrate that OT uniquely facilitates adaptive fear but reduces maladaptive anxiety. Last, we explore the limited literature on endogenous OT and its interaction with corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) with a special emphasis on the dorsolateral BNST, which may hold the key to the neurobiology of phasic fear and sustained anxiety.
28814894<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Startle modulation by heat pain with varying threat levels in chronic pain patients and pain-free controls.<<>>BACKGROUND: Empirical evidence suggests that affective responses to pain are changed in chronic pain. The investigation of startle responses to pain might contribute to clarifying whether such alterations also expand to motivational defensive reactions. We aimed at comparing startle responses to tonic heat pain with high threat (HT) or low threat (LT) in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain and controls. As pain-related anxiety and catastrophizing are typically elevated in chronic pain, we expected to find stronger startle responses in patients specifically under experimental HT. METHODS: Patients with chronic musculoskeletal, preferentially, back pain (N = 19) and matched pain-free controls (N = 19) underwent two pain-related threat conditions (high and low) in balanced order. Only, in the HT condition, 50% of the trials were announced to include a short further noxious temperature increase at the end. Startle responses to loud tones were always assessed prior to a potential temperature increase in the phase of anticipation and were recorded by surface electromyogram. RESULTS: Surprisingly, we observed no differences in startle responses and ratings of emotional and pain responses between patients and controls despite significantly higher pain-related anxiety and catastrophizing in the patients. Overall, startle was potentiated in the HT condition, but only in participants who started with this condition. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that, in general, patients with pain are not more responsive emotionally to experimental threat manipulations despite elevated pain anxiety and catastrophizing. Instead, exaggerated responses in patients might be triggered only by individual concerns relating to pain, which are not sufficiently mirrored by our threat paradigm.
27551023<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Diagnosis Threat and Injury Beliefs After Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.<<>>BACKGROUND: Diagnosis threat is a psychosocial factor proposed to contribute to poor cognitive outcomes following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). The current research explored diagnosis threat impact on objective and subjective cognitive performance in a "high risk" population of athletes. Two possible moderators of diagnosis threat - injury beliefs and suggestibility - were also investigated. METHOD: Seventy-six participants with a history of mTBI were recruited through sports clubs and randomized to a months threat group (instructions drew attention to mTBI history) or a control group (no mention of mTBI). They completed a battery of neuropsychological tests and questionnaires regarding day-to-day cognitive abilities. Measures of depression, anxiety, illness beliefs and suggestibility were also collected. RESULTS: No significant group differences were found on any neuropsychological tasks, nor on self-report of cognitive difficulties. Illness beliefs were not found to play a moderating role in general, although the majority of the study sample did not report negative mTBI beliefs and expectations: concern about the consequences of injury was associated with weaker performance on one test, WAIS-III Digit Span performance. Suggestibility was also found to have a significant affect on this test. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis threat did not appear to have a marked affect on objective or subjective cognitive performance after mTBI in athletes. Differing injury beliefs between the study's athlete population and the general population is a possible explanation for different findings in the area. This and other sources of potential variation in the affect of diagnosis threat are discussed.
26332665<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Contextual startle responses moderate the relation between behavioral inhibition and anxiety in middle childhood.<<>>Behavioral inhibition (BI), a temperament characterized in early childhood by wariness and avoidance of novelty, is a risk factor for anxiety disorders. An enhanced startle response has been observed in adolescents characterized with BI in childhood, particularly when they also manifest concurrent symptoms of anxiety. However, no prior study has examined relations among BI, startle responsivity, and anxiety in a prospective manner. Data for the present study were from a longitudinal study of infant temperament. Maternal reports and observations of BI were assessed at ages 2 and 3. At age 7, participants completed a startle procedure, while electromyography was collected, where participants viewed different colors on a screen that were associated with either the delivery of an aversive stimulus (i.e., puff of air to the larynx; threat cue) or the absence of the aversive stimulus (i.e., safety cue). Parental reports of child anxiety were collected when children were 7 and 9 years of age. Results revealed that startle responses at age 7 moderated the relation between early BI and 9-year anxiety. These findings provide insight into one potential mechanism that may place behaviorally inhibited children at risk for anxiety.
27659553<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Using a cultural and RDoC framework to conceptualize anxiety in Asian Americans.<<>>Asian Americans are one of the fastest growing minority groups in the United States; however, mental health within this population segment, particularly anxiety disorders, remains significantly understudied. Both the heterogeneity within the Asian American population and the multidimensional nature of anxiety contribute to difficulties in understanding anxiety in this population. The present paper reviewed two sources of heterogeneity within anxiety in Asian Americans: (1) cultural variables and (2) mechanisms or components of anxiety. Specifically, we examined four cultural variables most commonly found in research related to anxiety in Asian Americans: acculturation, loss of face, affect valuation, and individualism-collectivism. We also discussed ways to parse anxiety through a Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework, specifically focusing on sensitivity to acute and potential threat, constructs within the Negative Valence System. Previously unpublished preliminary data were presented to illustrate one way of examining ethnic differences in anxiety using an RDoC framework. Finally, this paper offered recommendations for future work in this area.
27196537<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>The genetics of anxiety-related negative valence system traits.<<>>NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domain of negative valence systems (NVS) captures constructs of negative affect such as fear and distress traditionally subsumed under the various internalizing disorders. Through its aims to capture dimensional measures that cut across diagnostic categories and are linked to underlying neurobiological systems, a large number of phenotypic constructs have been proposed as potential research targets. Since "genes" represent a central "unit of analysis" in the RDoC matrix, it is important for studies going forward to apply what is known about the genetics of these phenotypes as well as fill in the gaps of existing knowledge. This article reviews the extant genetic epidemiological data (twin studies, heritability) and molecular genetic association findings for a broad range of putative NVS phenotypic measures. We find that scant genetic epidemiological data is available for experimentally derived measures such as attentional bias, peripheral physiology, or brain-based measures of threat response. The molecular genetic basis of NVS phenotypes is in its infancy, since most studies have focused on a small number of candidate genes selected for putative association to anxiety disorders (ADs). Thus, more research is required to provide a firm understanding of the genetic aspects of anxiety-related NVS constructs. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
27277950<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Attention bias to threat indicates anxiety differences in sheep.<<>>Humans and animals show increased attention towards threatening stimuli when they are in increased states of anxiety. The few animal studies that have examined this phenomenon, known as attention bias, have applied environmental manipulations to induce anxiety but the effects of drug-induced anxiety levels on attention bias have not been demonstrated. Here, we present an attention bias test to identify high and low anxiety states in sheep using pharmacological manipulation. Increased anxiety was induced using 1-methyl-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) and decreased anxiety with diazepam, and then we examined the behaviour of sheep in response to the presence of a dog as a threat. Increased attention towards the threat and increased vigilance were shown in sheep that received the m-CPP and reduced in sheep receiving the diazepam. The modulated attention towards a threat displayed by the m-CPP and diazepam animals suggests that attention bias can assess different levels of anxiety in sheep. Measuring attention bias has the potential to improve animal welfare assessment protocols.
25444169<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Dorsomedial Prefrontal Cortex Mediates the Impact of Serotonin Transporter Linked Polymorphic Region Genotype on Anticipatory Threat Reactions.<<>>BACKGROUND: Excessive anticipatory reactions to potential future adversity are observed across a range of anxiety disorders, but the neurogenetic mechanisms driving interindividual differences are largely unknown. We aimed to discover and validate a gene-brain-behavior pathway by linking presumed genetic risk for anxiety-related psychopathology, key neural activity involved in anxious anticipation, and resulting aversive emotional states. METHODS: The functional neuroanatomy of aversive anticipation was probed through functional magnetic resonance imaging in two independent samples of healthy subjects (n = 99 and n = 69), and we studied the influence of genetic variance in the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR). Skin conductance and startle data served as objective psychophysiological indices of the intensity of individuals' anticipatory responses to potential threat. RESULTS: Threat cues signaling risk of future electrical shock activated the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), anterior insula, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, thalamus, and midbrain consistently across both samples. Threat-related dmPFC activation was enhanced in 5-HTTLPR short allele carriers in sample 1 and this effect was validated in sample 2. Critically, we show that this region mediates the increase in anticipatory psychophysiological reactions in short allele carriers indexed by skin conductance (experiment 1) and startle reactions (experiment 2). CONCLUSIONS: The converging results from these experiments demonstrate that innate 5-HTTLPR linked variation in dmPFC activity predicts psychophysiological responsivity to pending threats. Our results reveal a neurogenetic pathway mediating interindividual variability in anticipatory responses to threat and yield a novel mechanistic account for previously reported associations between genetic variability in serotonin transporter function and stress-related psychopathology.
27167217<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>What Is Going On Around Here? Intolerance of Uncertainty Predicts Threat Generalization.<<>>Attending to stimuli that share perceptual similarity to learned threats is an adaptive strategy. However, prolonged threat generalization to cues signalling safety is considered a core feature of pathological anxiety. One potential factor that may sustain over-generalization is sensitivity to future threat uncertainty. To assess the extent to which Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) predicts threat generalization, we recorded skin conductance in 54 healthy participants during an associative learning paradigm, where threat and safety cues varied in perceptual similarity. Lower IU was associated with stronger discrimination between threat and safety cues during acquisition and extinction. Higher IU, however, was associated with generalized responding to threat and safety cues during acquisition, and delayed discrimination between threat and safety cues during extinction. These results were specific to IU, over and above other measures of anxious disposition. These findings highlight: (1) a critical role of uncertainty-based mechanisms in threat generalization, and (2) IU as a potential risk factor for anxiety disorder development.
19188539<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Neural bases of social anxiety disorder: emotional reactivity and cognitive regulation during social and physical threat.<<>>CONTEXT: Social anxiety disorder is thought to involve emotional hyperreactivity, cognitive distortions, and ineffective emotion regulation. While the neural bases of emotional reactivity to social stimuli have been described, the neural bases of emotional reactivity and cognitive regulation during social and physical threat, and their relationship to social anxiety symptom severity, have yet to be investigated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate behavioral and neural correlates of emotional reactivity and cognitive regulation in patients and controls during processing of social and physical threat stimuli. DESIGN: Participants were trained to implement cognitive-linguistic regulation of emotional reactivity induced by social (harsh facial expressions) and physical (violent scenes) threat while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging and providing behavioral ratings of negative emotion experience. SETTING: Academic psychology department. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen adults with social anxiety disorder and 17 demographically matched healthy controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood oxygen level-dependent signal and negative emotion ratings. RESULTS: Behaviorally, patients reported greater negative emotion than controls during social and physical threat but showed equivalent reduction in negative emotion following cognitive regulation. Neurally, viewing social threat resulted in greater emotion-related neural responses in patients than controls, with social anxiety symptom severity related to activity in a network of emotion- and attention-processing regions in patients only. Viewing physical threat produced no between-group differences. Regulation during social threat resulted in greater cognitive and attention regulation-related brain activation in controls compared with patients. Regulation during physical threat produced greater cognitive control-related response (ie, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) in patients compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with controls, patients demonstrated exaggerated negative emotion reactivity and reduced cognitive regulation-related neural activation, specifically for social threat stimuli. These findings help to elucidate potential neural mechanisms of emotion regulation that might serve as biomarkers for interventions for social anxiety disorder.
29672111<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>"The impact of uncertain threat on affective bias: Individual differences in response to ambiguity": Correction.<<>>Reports an error in "The impact of uncertain threat on affective bias: Individual differences in response to ambiguity" by Maital Neta, Julie Cantelon, Zachary Haga, Caroline R. Mahoney, Holly A. Taylor and F. Caroline Davis (Emotion, 2017[Dec], Vol 17[8], 1137-1143). In this article, the copyright attribution was incorrectly listed under the Creative Commons CC-BY license due to production-related error. The correct copyright should be "In the public domain." The online version of this article has been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2017-40275-001.) Individuals who operate under highly stressful conditions (e.g., military personnel and first responders) are often faced with the challenge of quickly interpreting ambiguous information in uncertain and threatening environments. When faced with ambiguity, it is likely adaptive to view potentially dangerous stimuli as threatening until contextual information proves otherwise. One laboratory-based paradigm that can be used to simulate uncertain threat is known as threat of shock (TOS), in which participants are told that they might receive mild but unpredictable electric shocks while performing an unrelated task. The uncertainty associated with this potential threat induces a state of emotional arousal that is not overwhelmingly stressful, but has widespread-both adaptive and maladaptive-effects on cognitive and affective function. For example, TOS is thought to enhance aversive processing and abolish positivity bias. Importantly, in certain situations (e.g., when walking home alone at night), this anxiety can promote an adaptive state of heightened vigilance and defense mobilization. In the present study, we used TOS to examine the effects of uncertain threat on valence bias, or the tendency to interpret ambiguous social cues as positive or negative. As predicted, we found that heightened emotional arousal elicited by TOS was associated with an increased tendency to interpret ambiguous cues negatively. Such negative interpretations are likely adaptive in situations in which threat detection is critical for survival and should override an individual's tendency to interpret ambiguity positively in safe contexts.

28733210<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Threat effects on human oculo-motor function.<<>>Neuro-anatomical evidence supports the potential for threat-related factors, such as fear, anxiety and vigilance, to influence brainstem motor nuclei controlling eye movements, as well as the vestibular nuclei. However, little is known about how threat influences human ocular responses, such as eye saccades (ES), smooth pursuit eye tracking (SP), and optokinetic nystagmus (OKN), and whether these responses can be facilitated above normal baseline levels with a natural source of threat. This study was designed to examine the effects of height-induced postural threat on the gain of ES, SP and OKN responses in humans. Twenty participants stood at two different surface heights while performing ES (ranging from 8 degrees to 45 degrees from center), SP (15, 20, 30 degrees /s) and OKN (15, 30, 60 degrees /s) responses in the horizontal plane. Height did not significantly increase the slope of the relationship between ES peak velocity and initial amplitude, or the gain of ES amplitude. In contrast height significantly increased SP and OKN gain. Significant correlations were found between changes in physiological arousal and OKN gain. Observations of changes with height in OKN and SP support neuro-anatomical evidence of threat-related mechanisms influencing both oculo-motor nuclei and vestibular reflex pathways. Although further study is warranted, the findings suggest that potential influences of fear, anxiety and arousal/alertness should be accounted for, or controlled, during clinical vestibular and oculo-motor testing.
18695520<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Anxiety and the neural processing of threat in faces.<<>>This study examined the relationship between social anxiety and the neural processing of threat in faces. Twenty-one adults with different levels of society anxiety were tested for their event-related potential responses to unattended threatening and nonthreatening faces, presented upright and upside-down, at three points in time: 160-210 ms (vertex positive potential), 300-350 ms (N3) and 440-500 ms (P3). Social anxiety was significantly correlated with the size of P3 to upright angry faces but not happy faces. This supports the theory that anxiety diverts attention towards goal-irrelevant threat cues, and suggests that this threat-related shift in attention starts to affect the processing of faces at 440-500 ms.
28274659<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Anxiety and neural responses to infant and adult faces during pregnancy.<<>>Women are vulnerable to anxiety during pregnancy and postpartum. However, little is known about antenatal anxiety and neural processing of infant-relevant information. In this experiment, the N170, P300, and LPP (late positive potential) event-related potentials were measured from 43 pregnant women as they viewed infant and adult faces, which were either neutral or distressed in expression. Mother's self-reported anxiety levels were also assessed. The N170 was comparable across face conditions and was not associated with anxiety. However, our central finding was that greater levels of antenatal anxiety were associated with a larger LPP, but only for neutral infant faces. Results suggest that antenatal anxiety may result in deeper processing of neutral, emotionally ambiguous, infant faces during pregnancy. These findings are discussed in light of other work indicating an interpretive bias toward threat in response to neutral stimuli in anxiety.
29210194<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Error-related brain activity and anxiety symptoms in youth with autism spectrum disorder.<<>>Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often experience symptoms associated with generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and social anxiety disorder. In other populations, these same symptoms are associated with a larger error-related negativity (ERN), an event-related potential that reflects endogenous threat sensitivity. As such, it is possible that the ERN may relate to the clinical presentation of anxiety in ASD. However, studies examining these associations in youth with ASD have yielded mixed results. The present study aimed to clarify this relationship by examining the ERN in relation to these specific anxiety symptoms in ASD, and by accounting for typical covariates (e.g., age, verbal abilities, depression, ASD symptoms) of the ERN. Fifty-one youth, ages 8-17, with ASD and intact cognitive ability completed a modified Flanker task, from which the ERN component was obtained. Measures of anxiety, verbal abilities, depression, and ASD symptoms were collected from participants and parents. Results revealed that greater self-reported social anxiety symptoms, specifically performance fears but not humiliation/rejection fears, were associated with an increased neural response to errors, as measured by the ERN. This relationship remained after controlling for other anxiety symptoms, as well as age, verbal IQ, depression symptoms, and ASD symptoms. Findings suggest that heightened threat sensitivity may be characteristic of individuals with ASD who exhibit social fearfulness. Autism Res 2018, 11: 342-354. (c) 2017 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: The error-related negativity (ERN) is a physiological measure of the brain's response to errors which is thought to reflect threat sensitivity and has been implicated in anxiety disorders in individuals without autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The present study revealed that the ERN is related to social anxiety symptoms, specifically performance fears, in a sample of youth with ASD. Findings suggest that heightened threat sensitivity may be characteristic of individuals with ASD who exhibit social fearfulness.
25711937<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Increased gain of vestibulospinal potentials evoked in neck and leg muscles when standing under height-induced postural threat.<<>>OBJECTIVE: To measure changes in amplitudes of vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) elicited from neck, upper and lower limb muscles during a quiet standing task with increased postural threat achieved by manipulating surface height. METHODS: Twenty eight subjects were tested while standing on a platform raised to 0.8 m and 3.2 m from the ground. Surface electromyography was recorded from the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid (SCM), biceps brachii (BB), flexor carpi radialis (FCR), soleus (SOL) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscles. Stimulation was with air-conducted short tone bursts (4 ms). After controlling for background muscle activity, VEMP amplitudes were compared between heights and correlated with changes in state anxiety, fear and arousal. RESULTS: VEMP amplitude significantly increased in SCM (9%) and SOL (12.7%) with increased surface height (p<0.05). These modest increases in SCM VEMP amplitude were significantly correlated with anxiety (Rho=0.57, p=0.004) and confidence (Rho=-0.38, p=0.047) and those for SOL were significantly correlated with anxiety (Rho=0.33, p=0.049) and fear (Rho=0.36, p=0.037). CONCLUSION: Postural threat significantly increased vestibulospinal reflex (VSR) gains. Results demonstrate that VEMPs can be used to test different VSR pathways simultaneously during stance. Since fear and anxiety are prevalent with vestibular disorders, they should be considered as potential contributing factors for clinical vestibular outcome measures.
27318217<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Attention mechanisms during predictable and unpredictable threat - A steady-state visual evoked potential approach.<<>>Fear is elicited by imminent threat and leads to phasic fear responses with selective attention, whereas anxiety is characterized by a sustained state of heightened vigilance due to uncertain danger. In the present study, we investigated attention mechanisms in fear and anxiety by adapting the NPU-threat test to measure steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs). We investigated ssVEPs across no aversive events (N), predictable aversive events (P), and unpredictable aversive events (U), signaled by four-object arrays (30s). In addition, central cues were presented during all conditions but predictably signaled imminent threat only during the P condition. Importantly, cues and context events were flickered at different frequencies (15Hz vs. 20Hz) in order to disentangle respective electrocortical responses. The onset of the context elicited larger electrocortical responses for U compared to P context. Conversely, P cues elicited larger electrocortical responses compared to N cues. Interestingly, during the presence of the P cue, visuocortical processing of the concurrent context was also enhanced. The results support the notion of enhanced initial hypervigilance to unpredictable compared to predictable threat contexts, while predictable cues show electrocortical enhancement of the cues themselves but additionally a boost of context processing.
26547015<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>A Scent of Anxiety: Olfactory Context Conditioning and its Influence on Social Cues.<<>>Perception and evaluation of objects are highly dependent on surrounding contexts. Threatening contexts enhance processing of faces. Because odors are assumed to deliver strong contextual information, the present study aimed at demonstrating 1) that odors can constitute threat and safety contexts, and 2) consequently modulate the processing of faces presented in these contexts. Therefore, previously neutral odors were used as contextual stimuli in a context conditioning paradigm, resulting in an olfactory anxiety and a safety context. Then, faces showing angry, neutral, or fearful expressions were presented within both contexts during a test phase to investigate the effects of threat versus safety contexts on face perception. The late positive potential (LPP) from the EEG, skin conductance level, and subjective ratings were recorded. Results reveal successful olfactory context conditioning as reflected in enhanced processing of the anxiety context, indicated by enhanced LPP after conditioning, increased skin conductance level, and marginally respectively increased ratings. Moreover, faces presented within the threat context were rated as more unpleasant and marginally more arousing than faces presented in the safety context. Thus, olfactory stimuli can serve as context in fear conditioning, and a threatening olfactory context seems to enhance processing of stimuli perceived within this context.
26969581<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Attention training to pleasant stimuli in anxiety.<<>>Attentional bias for threatening stimuli in anxiety is a common finding in the literature. The present study addressed whether attention training toward pleasant stimuli can reduce anxiety symptoms and induce a processing bias in favor of pleasant information in nonpatients who were selected to score similarly to individuals with generalized anxiety or panic disorder on a measure of worry or physiological arousal, respectively. Participants were randomly assigned to attention training to pleasant (ATP) stimuli or to a placebo control (PC) condition. All participants completed baseline and post-test dot-probe measures of attentional bias while event-related brain potentials were recorded. As expected, worry symptoms decreased in the ATP and not PC condition. ATP was also associated with early evidence (P100 amplitude) of greater attentional prioritization of probes replacing neutral stimuli within threat-neutral word pairs from pre-to-post intervention and later RT evidence of facilitated processing of probes replacing pleasant stimuli within pleasant-threat word pairs at post compared to PC. PC was associated with later evidence (P300 latency) of less efficient evaluation of probes following pleasant stimuli within pleasant-threat word pairs from pre-to-post and later RT evidence of facilitated processing of probes following threat stimuli within pleasant-threat word pairs at post compared to ATP. Results highlight early and later mechanisms of attention processing changes and underscore the potential of pleasant stimuli in optimizing attention-training interventions for anxiety.
21972425<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Storm in a coffee cup: caffeine modifies brain activation to social signals of threat.<<>>Caffeine, an adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptor antagonist, is the most popular psychostimulant drug in the world, but it is also anxiogenic. The neural correlates of caffeine-induced anxiety are currently unknown. This study investigated the effects of caffeine on brain regions implicated in social threat processing and anxiety. Participants were 14 healthy male non/infrequent caffeine consumers. In a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design, they underwent blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing an emotional face processing task 1 h after receiving caffeine (250 mg) or placebo in two fMRI sessions (counterbalanced, 1-week washout). They rated anxiety and mental alertness, and their blood pressure was measured, before and 2 h after treatment. Results showed that caffeine induced threat-related (angry/fearful faces > happy faces) midbrain-periaqueductal gray activation and abolished threat-related medial prefrontal cortex wall activation. Effects of caffeine on extent of threat-related amygdala activation correlated negatively with level of dietary caffeine intake. In concurrence with these changes in threat-related brain activation, caffeine increased self-rated anxiety and diastolic blood pressure. Caffeine did not affect primary visual cortex activation. These results are the first to demonstrate potential neural correlates of the anxiogenic effect of caffeine, and they implicate the amygdala as a key site for caffeine tolerance.
26726817<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Depression and reduced neural response to emotional images: Distinction from anxiety, and importance of symptom dimensions and age of onset.<<>>Abnormal patterns of attention to threat and reward have been proposed as potential mechanisms of dysfunction in anxiety and unipolar depressive disorders. However, few studies have simultaneously examined whether these patterns of attention are shared among disorders or distinguish between them. In the present study, we recorded the Late Positive Potential (LPP), an event-related potential and putative index of motivated attention, from 145 patients with anxiety and unipolar depressive disorders and 32 controls, as they viewed blocks of rewarding and threatening images, respectively. We found that a current diagnosis of depression was associated with a reduced LPP to rewarding visual stimuli. This appeared to be specific to a subgroup of individuals with early onset depression; this subgroup was also characterized by a reduced LPP to threatening images. Anxiety diagnosis and age of onset of anxiety, whether comorbid with depression or not, was unrelated to the magnitude of the LPP. Finally, a transdiagnostic symptom dimension measuring current severity of suicidal ideation was related to a reduced LPP to both rewarding and threatening images. These data suggest that dysfunction in neural markers of attention to threat and reward can effectively distinguish features of depression from anxiety, particularly early onset depression, and may track suicidal ideation across disorders.
25281030<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Pathways to social anxiety: the role of reinforcement sensitivities and emotion regulation.<<>>Past research has demonstrated a strong relationship between threat sensitivity and social anxiety; however, the relationship between reward sensitivity and social anxiety is less clear. Further, the role that emotion regulation (ER) may play in the expression of social anxiety disorder (SAD) is rarely considered. The current study tested whether two emotion regulation strategies (emotional suppression and cognitive reappraisal) mediated associations between threat sensitivity and reward sensitivity and social anxiety in a community sample (402 adults, 78% female; Mage=32.49, S.D.age=11.53). Path analyses indicated that low reappraisal mediated the relationship between high threat sensitivity and high social anxiety; and both low reappraisal and high suppression mediated the relationship between low reward sensitivity and high social anxiety. These results highlight the potential role that emotion regulation plays in the relationship between trait motivation and social anxiety.
30112670<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Attention and anticipation in response to varying levels of uncertain threat: An ERP study.<<>>Individual differences in responding to uncertainty have been proposed as a key mechanism of how anxiety disorders develop and are maintained. However, most empirical work has compared responding to uncertain versus certain threat dichotomously. This is a significant limitation because uncertainty in daily life occurs along a continuum of probability, ranging from very low to high chances of negative outcomes. The current study investigated (1) how varying levels of uncertainty impact attention and anticipatory emotion, and (2) how these effects are moderated by individual differences in risk factors for anxiety disorders, particularly intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and worry. Participants (n = 65) completed a card task in which the probability of shock varied across trials. Two event-related potential components were examined: the P2, an index of attention, and the stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN), an index of anticipation. The P2 tracked the level of uncertainty and was smaller for more uncertain outcomes. Participants higher in IU exhibited greater differences in the P2 across levels of uncertainty. The SPN did not track specific levels of uncertainty but was largest for uncertain threat compared with certain threat and safety. Greater worry was associated with blunting of the SPN in anticipation of all outcomes. Thus, attention appears to be sensitive to variations in uncertainty, whereas anticipation seems sensitive to uncertainty globally. The two processes appear to be distinctly related to anxiety risk factors. These results highlight the value of examining multiple aspects of anticipatory responding to varying levels of uncertainty for understanding risk for anxiety disorders.
21056591<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Risk assessment as an evolved threat detection and analysis process.<<>>Risk assessment is a pattern of activities involved in detection and analysis of threat stimuli and the situations in which the threat is encountered. It is a core process in the choice of specific defenses, such as flight, freezing, defensive threat and defensive attack, that counter the threat and minimize the danger it poses. This highly adaptive process takes into account important characteristics, such as type and location (including distance from the subject) of the threat, as well as those (e.g. presence of an escape route or hiding place) of the situation, combining them to predict which specific defense is optimal with that particular combination of threat and situation. Risk assessment is particularly associated with ambiguity either of the threat stimulus or of the outcome of available defensive behaviors. It is also crucial in determining that threat is no longer present, permitting a return to normal, nondefensive behavior. Although risk assessment has been described in detail in rodents, it is also a feature of human defensive behavior, particularly in association with ambiguity. Rumination may be a specifically human form of risk assessment, more often expressed by women, and highly associated with anxiety. Risk assessment behaviors respond to drugs effective against generalized anxiety disorder; however, flight, a dominant specific defense in many common situations, shows a pharmacological response profile closer to that of panic disorder. Risk assessment and flight also appear to show some consistent differences in terms of brain regional activation patterns, suggesting a potential biological differentiation of anxiety and fear/panic systems. An especially intriguing possibility is that mirror neurons may respond to some of the same types of situational differences that are analyzed during risk assessment, suggesting an additional functional role for these neurons.
28910121<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>The impact of uncertain threat on affective bias: Individual differences in response to ambiguity.<<>>Individuals who operate under highly stressful conditions (e.g., military personnel and first responders) are often faced with the challenge of quickly interpreting ambiguous information in uncertain and threatening environments. When faced with ambiguity, it is likely adaptive to view potentially dangerous stimuli as threatening until contextual information proves otherwise. One laboratory-based paradigm that can be used to simulate uncertain threat is known as threat of shock (TOS), in which participants are told that they might receive mild but unpredictable electric shocks while performing an unrelated task. The uncertainty associated with this potential threat induces a state of emotional arousal that is not overwhelmingly stressful, but has widespread-both adaptive and maladaptive-effects on cognitive and affective function. For example, TOS is thought to enhance aversive processing and abolish positivity bias. Importantly, in certain situations (e.g., when walking home alone at night), this anxiety can promote an adaptive state of heightened vigilance and defense mobilization. In the present study, we used TOS to examine the effects of uncertain threat on valence bias, or the tendency to interpret ambiguous social cues as positive or negative. As predicted, we found that heightened emotional arousal elicited by TOS was associated with an increased tendency to interpret ambiguous cues negatively. Such negative interpretations are likely adaptive in situations in which threat detection is critical for survival and should override an individual's tendency to interpret ambiguity positively in safe contexts.

30384149<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Examination of evaluative threat in worry: Insights from the Error-Related Negativity (ERN).<<>>Recent research suggests atypical error-monitoring is important to understanding pathological anxiety. Because uncertainty is a transdiagnostic factor associated with anxiety and related disorders, recent research has begun to examine the influence of uncertainty in error-monitoring. Moreover, task irrelevant threat has been shown to influence cognitive performance in individuals with maladaptive anxiety. The current study aims to merge these literatures by examining the influence of task-irrelevant uncertain evaluative threat on error-monitoring using an event-related brain potential, the error-related negativity (ERN). Considering extensive literature indicating a relationship between worry and the ERN, worry was included as a continuous predictor in the analyses. Participants were randomly assigned to either a condition of negative or uncertain evaluative threat to determine their influence on error-monitoring in a Flankers task. Results for the ERN suggest that the ERN was significantly reduced only for the uncertain evaluative threat condition. The current study suggests that uncertain evaluative threat distractors result in a subsequent reduction in error-monitoring. This is consistent with literature suggesting that anxiety impairs inhibition of attentional processing of task irrelevant threatening information. This study adds to the burgeoning literature on the malleability of the ERN. Future research is needed to determine the mechanisms underlying this effect.
21619900<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Does intolerance of uncertainty predict anticipatory startle responses to uncertain threat?<<>>Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) has been proposed to be an important maintaining factor in several anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and social phobia. While IU has been shown to predict subjective ratings and decision-making during uncertain/ambiguous situations, few studies have examined whether IU also predicts emotional responding to uncertain threat. The present study examined whether IU predicted aversive responding (startle and subjective ratings) during the anticipation of temporally uncertain shocks. Sixty-nine participants completed three experimental conditions during which they received: no shocks, temporally certain/predictable shocks, and temporally uncertain shocks. Results indicated that IU was negatively associated with startle during the uncertain threat condition in that those with higher IU had a smaller startle response. IU was also only related to startle during the uncertain (and not the certain/predictable) threat condition, suggesting that it was not predictive of general aversive responding, but specific to responses to uncertain aversiveness. Perceived control over anxiety-related events mediated the relation between IU and startle to uncertain threat, such that high IU led to lowered perceived control, which in turn led to a smaller startle response. We discuss several potential explanations for these findings, including the inhibitory qualities of IU. Overall, our results suggest that IU is associated with attenuated aversive responding to uncertain threat.
27440250<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Evaluating the Effectiveness of a School-Based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy Intervention for Anxiety in Adolescents Diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder.<<>>This study evaluated the effectiveness of a school-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) on symptoms of anxiety, social worry and social responsiveness, and indices of attentional control and attentional biases to threat in adolescents diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Thirty-five young people (11-14 years; IQ > 70) with ASD and elevated teacher or parent reported anxiety were randomly assigned to 6 sessions of the Exploring Feelings CBT intervention (Attwood in Exploring feelings (anxiety). Future Horizons, Arlington, 2004) (n = 18) or a wait-list control group (n = 17). The intervention (compared to the wait-list control) group showed positive change for parent, teacher and self-reported anxiety symptoms, and more marginal effects of increased teacher-reported social responsiveness. The discussion highlights the potential value and limitations of school-based CBT for young people with ASD.
30219564<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Living in fear: Low-cost avoidance maintains low-level threat.<<>>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Excessive avoidance of potential threat is a hallmark of anxiety and is thought to maintain fear by preserving the perceived high-threat value of avoided situations. Previous research has shown that the availability of avoidance maintains low-level threat. Here, we investigated whether an opportunity to engage in avoidance in the presence of a low-threat value safety cue would maintain its perceived threat value when avoidance was unavailable. METHODS: In a threat conditioning procedure, one conditional danger stimulus (CS+; A+) was followed by an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US; electric shock), and two safety stimuli (CS-; B- and C-) were never followed by the US. Next, clicking a button present during A+ avoided the scheduled US. Avoidance was then made available during C- for participants in the Experimental group but not in the Control group. In the test, all stimuli were presented without the opportunity to avoid. Threat expectancy, eyeblink startle electromyography (EMG), and skin conductance responses (SCRs) were measured. RESULTS: Findings showed an increase in threat expectancy for only C- in the Experimental group during the test phase following avoidance learning to similar levels as during threat conditioning. Compared to the Control group, threat expectancy for both B- and C- remained higher in Experimental group. SCR and startle EMG data did not corroborate these findings. LIMITATIONS: Further research is needed to test the commonly held clinical assumption that avoidance can increase threat value. CONCLUSIONS: Low-cost avoidance maintains low-threat value of safety cues.
30326246<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Visual cues of threat elicit greater steady-state electroencephalographic responses than visual reminders of death.<<>>Terror management theory (TMT) suggests that reminders of death activate an exclusive anxiety mechanism different from the one activated by other types of symbolic threats. This notion is supported by evidence showing how experimental participants verbally reflecting on their own death are then influenced in their opinions and behaviours. A previous study showed that magnitude of electroencephalography (EEG) activity is greater when images depicting death-related content are coupled with painful thermal stimuli compared to threat-related content. Here we expand on previous research by testing whether similar effects may be brought about by passive observation of generic visual reminders of death. More precisely, we hypothesised that fast periodic presentation of death-related vs. more generic threat-related images determine a preferential modulation of brain activity measured by means of EEG. In two experiments, we found that images depicting death content elicit lower frequency-tagged EEG response compared to more generic threat images. Visual evoked potentials revealed that a brief change of the scene from neutral to threat content elicits greater amplitude at the late latencies (compatible with a P300 potential), particularly at the parieto-occipital sites. Altogether, our findings suggest that, in a context where no reflection on death cues is allowed and no threatening stimuli in other modality occur, visual death cues trigger lower neural synchronisation than that elicited by similarly negative and arousing cues with divergent threatening meaning.
30667260<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Threat learning promotes generalization of episodic memory.<<>>The ability to generalize from and distinguish between aversive memories and novel experiences is critical to survival. Previous research has revealed mechanisms underlying generalization of threat-conditioned defensive responses, but little is known about generalization of episodic memory for threatening events. Here we tested if aversive learning influences generalization of episodic memory for threatening events in human adults. Subjects underwent Pavlovian threat-conditioning in which objects from one category were paired with a shock and objects from a different category were unpaired. The next day, subjects underwent a recognition memory test that included old, highly similar, and entirely novel items from the shock-paired and shock-unpaired object categories. Results showed that items highly similar to those from the object category previously paired with shock were mistaken for old items more often than items from the shock-unpaired category. This finding indicates that threat learning promotes generalization of episodic memory, and is consistent with the idea that threat generalization is an active process that may be adaptive for avoiding a myriad of potential threats following an emotional experience. Enhanced generalization of aversive episodic memories may be maladaptive, however, when old threat memories are inappropriately reactivated in harmless situations, exemplified in a number of stress- and anxiety-related disorders.

25664956<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Effect of trait anxiety on prefrontal control mechanisms during emotional conflict.<<>>Converging evidence points to a link between anxiety proneness and altered emotional functioning, including threat-related biases in selective attention and higher susceptibility to emotionally ambiguous stimuli. However, during these complex emotional situations, it remains unclear how trait anxiety affects the engagement of the prefrontal emotional control system and particularly the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a core region at the intersection of the limbic and prefrontal systems. Using an emotional conflict task and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated in healthy subjects the relations between trait anxiety and both regional activity and functional connectivity (psychophysiological interaction) of the ACC. Higher levels of anxiety were associated with stronger task-related activation in ACC but with reduced functional connectivity between ACC and lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC). These results support the hypothesis that when one is faced with emotionally incompatible information, anxiety leads to inefficient high-order control, characterized by insufficient ACC-LPFC functional coupling and increases, possibly compensatory, in activation of ACC. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of the neural circuitry underlying anxiety and may offer potential treatment markers for anxiety disorders.
24863147<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Evolutionarily conserved prefrontal-amygdalar dysfunction in early-life anxiety.<<>>Some individuals are endowed with a biology that renders them more reactive to novelty and potential threat. When extreme, this anxious temperament (AT) confers elevated risk for the development of anxiety, depression and substance abuse. These disorders are highly prevalent, debilitating and can be challenging to treat. The high-risk AT phenotype is expressed similarly in children and young monkeys and mechanistic work demonstrates that the central (Ce) nucleus of the amygdala is an important substrate. Although it is widely believed that the flow of information across the structural network connecting the Ce nucleus to other brain regions underlies primates' capacity for flexibly regulating anxiety, the functional architecture of this network has remained poorly understood. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in anesthetized young monkeys and quietly resting children with anxiety disorders to identify an evolutionarily conserved pattern of functional connectivity relevant to early-life anxiety. Across primate species and levels of awareness, reduced functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a region thought to play a central role in the control of cognition and emotion, and the Ce nucleus was associated with increased anxiety assessed outside the scanner. Importantly, high-resolution 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging provided evidence that elevated Ce nucleus metabolism statistically mediates the association between prefrontal-amygdalar connectivity and elevated anxiety. These results provide new clues about the brain network underlying extreme early-life anxiety and set the stage for mechanistic work aimed at developing improved interventions for pediatric anxiety.
26232750<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Threat to democracy: Physical and mental health impact of democracy movement in Hong Kong.<<>>BACKGROUND: This study examined the prevalence and critical predictors of anxiety and depressive symptoms and self-rated health, following the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong. METHODS: Random digit dialing recruited a population-representative sample of 1208 Chinese Hong Kong citizens (mean age=46.89 years; 63% female) in the first two weeks of February 2015. Respondents gave their informed consent and reported personal, social, and economic resource loss since the Umbrella Movement (Conservation of Resources-Evaluation), current anxiety symptoms (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), and self-rated health (1=very good, 4=very bad). RESULTS: A total of 47.35% (95% CI=44.55, 50.17) respondents reported moderate/severe anxiety symptoms and 14.4% (95% CI=12.54, 16.50) reported moderate/severe depressive symptoms; 9.11% (95% CI=7.61, 10.86) reported "poor" or "very poor" health. Multivariable regressions revealed that personal and social resource loss was associated with higher anxiety and depressive symptoms and greater odds of "very poor" health (adjusted odds ratios/incidence rate ratios=5-102%), independent of lower education level and income and being unmarried. LIMITATIONS: This study was cross-sectional in nature and thus could not determine causality from the associations between resource loss and outcome variables. Second, the telephone survey relied on self-reports; response bias and social desirability could influence respondents' answers and discount data validity. Third, potential confounders such as preexisting mental and physical health issues and concurrent predictors like exposure to the Umbrella Movement were not assessed. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies following any recent political movement (e.g., The Arab Spring) to quantify distress and the associated correlates of distress among affected citizens. Perceived psychosocial resource losses were critical predictors of poor outcomes.
27271859<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Anxiety-potentiated amygdala-medial frontal coupling and attentional control.<<>>Anxiety disorders can be treated both pharmacologically and psychologically, but many individuals either fail to respond to treatment or relapse. Improving outcomes is difficult, in part because we have incomplete understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying current treatments. In a sequence of studies, we have identified 'affective bias-related' amygdala-medial cortical coupling as a candidate substrate underlying adaptive anxiety (that is, anxiety elicited by threat of shock in healthy individuals) and shown that it is also chronically engaged in maladaptive anxiety disorders. We have provided evidence that this circuit can be modulated pharmacologically, but whether this mechanism can be shifted by simple psychological instruction is unknown. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we extend a previously used translational anxiety induction (threat of shock) in healthy subjects (N=43) and cognitive task to include an element of instructed attentional control. Replicating our previous findings, we show that induced anxiety engages 'affective bias-related' amygdala-dorsal medial frontal coupling during the processing of emotional faces. By contrast, instructing subjects to attend to neutral shapes (and ignore faces) disengages this circuitry and increases putative 'attentional control-related' coupling between the amygdala and a more rostral prefrontal region. These neural coupling changes are accompanied by corresponding modulation of behavioural performance. Taken together, these findings serve to further highlight the potential role of amygdala-medial frontal coupling in the pathogenesis of anxiety and highlight a mechanism by which it can be modulated via psychological instructions. This, in turn, generates hypotheses for future work exploring the mechanisms underlying psychological therapeutic interventions for anxiety.
21349242<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Cognitive bias modification for attention and interpretation reduces trait and state anxiety in anxious patients referred to an out-patient service: results from a pilot study.<<>>It is well established that anxious individuals show biases in information processing, such that they attend preferentially to threatening stimuli and interpret emotional ambiguity in a threatening way. It has also been established that these biases in attention and interpretation can causally influence anxiety. Recent advances in experimental work have involved the development of a paradigm known as Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM), a constellation of procedures which directly modify bias using computerised tasks. Excitingly, these procedures have been shown to reduce bias in attention to threat (CBM-A), and to promote a positive interpretive bias (CBM-I) in anxious populations; furthermore, these modifications are associated with reductions in anxiety. We believe that these techniques have the potential to create a real clinical impact for people with anxiety. Initial studies involved volunteer participants who reached criteria for clinical diagnoses to be made, but emerging evidence suggests that patients referred for therapy also benefit. For the purposes of experimentation researchers have normally looked at one procedure at a time. In order to try to maximise the potential clinical impact we wished to investigate whether the combination of the procedures would be more effective than either alone. We also wished to investigate whether the procedures could be carried out in routine clinical settings with patients referred to an out-patient psychological treatment service. We therefore carried out a pilot study using a combined approach of CBM-A and CBM-I with a sample of 13 anxious patients referred to an out-patient psychology service for cognitive therapy. The results showed successful reductions in threat related attentional and interpretive bias, as well as reductions in trait and state anxiety. Participant reports describe the procedures as acceptable, with the attentional task experienced as boring, but the interpretive one experienced as helpful. While recognising the methodological problems of the pilot study we believe that these results give indications that the techniques could provide an effective intervention for anxiety, and that further study is well justified.
26874188<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Future-Oriented Thought Patterns Associated With Anxiety and Depression in Later Life: The Intriguing Prospects of Prospection.<<>>Anxiety and mood disorders in later life are the focus of an increasing amount of intervention research, however basic mechanisms and paradigms explaining etiology and maintenance warrant further exploration. Research on future-oriented thought patterns associated with anxiety and depression in this age group may prove useful, as these disorders are both characterized by a tendency to generate and fixate on threat-related future scenarios that may or may not materialize. Additionally, depression is associated with a reduced expectancy of positive future events. In this paper, we review the literature relevant to future thinking in anxiety and depression in older adults. We focus on the mental construction and anticipation of negative future events, and their underlying neurocognitive mechanisms. We then consider clinical and research implications of anxious and depressive future-oriented thought patterns for older adults. We believe that more research investigating future-oriented thought patterns associated with emotional disorders in later life could improve conceptualization, measurement, and perhaps potential treatments for late-life anxiety and depression.
26408036<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>When Threat Is Near, Get Out of Here: Dynamics of Defensive Behavior During Freezing and Active Avoidance.<<>>When detecting a threat, humans and other animals engage in defensive behaviors and supporting physiological adjustments that vary with threat imminence and potential response options. In the present study, we shed light on the dynamics of defensive behaviors and associated physiological adjustments in humans using multiple psychophysiological and brain measures. When participants were exposed to a dynamically approaching, uncontrollable threat, attentive freezing was augmented, as indicated by an increase in skin conductance, fear bradycardia, and potentiation of the startle reflex. In contrast, when participants had the opportunity to actively avoid the approaching threat, attention switched to response preparation, as indicated by an inhibition of the startle magnitude and by a sharp drop of the probe-elicited P3 component of the evoked brain potentials. These new findings on the dynamics of defensive behaviors form an important intersection between animal and human research and have important implications for understanding fear and anxiety-related disorders.
18294612<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Do controlling maternal behaviours increase state anxiety in children's responses to a social threat? A pilot study.<<>>Past research has demonstrated a link between controlling parenting and child anxiety. However, the causal nature of this association has not yet been established since most previous studies have utilised cross-sectional designs. The aim of the current study was to implement an experimental design to examine the impact of maternal control on children's state anxiety when faced with a social threat. Mothers of 26 children aged 7-13 years were randomly allocated to conditions in which they were either required to be overly controlling or minimally controlling during preparation of a practice speech by their child. In a subsequent speech that children were required to prepare alone, children whose mothers had previously been overly controlling during the practice showed greater anxiety than did children whose mothers had previously been minimally controlling. This pilot study describes a novel paradigm that has the potential to address issues related to the causal role of specific parenting behaviours in the experience of negative emotions.
24773231<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Computerized attention retraining for individuals with elevated health anxiety.<<>>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Current cognitive-behavioral theorists conceptualize hypochondriasis as excessive health anxiety (HA). Growing evidence suggests that elevated HA is associated with attentional bias (AB) toward potential health-threat information. DESIGN: This study aimed to examine the effects of attention retraining among individuals with elevated HA, using the established attention modification programs (AMP) designed to train participants to disengage attention from ideographically chosen health-threat words. METHODS: Thirty-six randomly assigned individuals with elevated HA completed eight twice-weekly sessions of the AMP (n = 18) or the attention control condition (ACC; n = 18). RESULTS: Despite using the well-established AMP protocol widely used within the field of anxiety disorders, we did not find evidence for change in AB following training. Further, AMP did not outperform ACC in reducing HA and other relevant emotional symptoms. However, both AMP and ACC evidenced overall significant symptom reduction in most of the outcome measures, including overall HA, anxiety sensitivity, general depression and anxiety, and somatic complaints. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed to better understand the effects and mechanisms of AMP as a possible cognitive intervention for HA.
30718320<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Glutamate Within the Marmoset Anterior Hippocampus Interacts with Area 25 to Regulate the Behavioral and Cardiovascular Correlates of High-Trait Anxiety.<<>>High-trait anxiety is a risk factor for the development of affective disorders and has been associated with decreased cardiovascular and behavioral responsivity to acute stressors in humans that may increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Although human neuroimaging studies of high-trait anxiety reveals dysregulation in primate cingulate areas 25 and 32 and the anterior hippocampus (aHipp) and rodent studies reveal the importance of aHipp glutamatergic hypofunction, the causal involvement of aHipp glutamate and its interaction with these areas in the primate brain is unknown. Accordingly, we correlated marmoset trait anxiety scores to their postmortem aHipp glutamate levels and showed that low glutamate in the right aHipp is associated with high-trait anxiety in marmosets. Moreover, pharmacologically increasing aHipp glutamate reduced anxiety levels in highly anxious marmosets in two uncertainty-based tests of anxiety: exposure to a human intruder with uncertain intent and unpredictable loud noise. In the human intruder test, increasing aHipp glutamate decreased anxiety by increasing approach to the intruder. In the unpredictable threat test, animals showed blunted behavioral and cardiovascular responsivity after control infusions, which was normalized by increasing aHipp glutamate. However, this aHipp-mediated anxiolytic effect was blocked by simultaneous pharmacological inactivation of area 25, but not area 32, areas which when inactivated independently reduced and had no effect on anxiety, respectively. These findings provide causal evidence in male and female primates that aHipp glutamatergic hypofunction and its regulation by area 25 contribute to the behavioral and cardiovascular symptoms of endogenous high-trait anxiety.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT High-trait anxiety predisposes sufferers to the development of anxiety and depression. Although neuroimaging of these disorders and rodent modeling implicate dysregulation in hippocampal glutamate and the subgenual/perigenual cingulate cortices (areas 25/32), the causal involvement of these structures in endogenous high-trait anxiety and their interaction are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that increased trait anxiety in marmoset monkeys correlates with reduced hippocampal glutamate and that increasing hippocampal glutamate release in high-trait-anxious monkeys normalizes the aberrant behavioral and cardiovascular responsivity to potential threats. This normalization was blocked by simultaneous inactivation of area 25, but not area 32. These findings provide casual evidence in primates that hippocampal glutamatergic hypofunction regulates endogenous high-trait anxiety and the hippocampal-area 25 circuit is a potential therapeutic target.
30590285<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Individual differences in anxiety and fear learning: The role of working memory capacity.<<>>Anxiety disorders are characterised by the perception of fear and threat in the presence of stimuli that are neutral or ambiguous. Attempts in previous research to explain the relationship between anxiety and fear learning have been inconsistent, possibly due to the influence of an unmeasured mechanism that mediates the relationship between them. Working memory capacity has been suggested as one such mechanism. The current study investigated the influence of anxiety-based individual differences upon associative fear learning, while accounting for individual differences in working memory. We hypothesised that individuals high in both anxiety and working memory would show unimpaired fear learning whereas individuals high in anxiety and low in working memory would exhibit dysfunctional fear learning. Sixty participants completed a battery of anxiety and working memory tests, as well as a fear conditioning experiment that tested for blocking, conditioned inhibition and fear discrimination. We found that anxious individuals were more likely to show impaired fear discrimination only if they also had a low working memory capacity. Furthermore, anxiety was particularly associated with poorer learning about safety cues. Such relationships were not observed for blocking and conditioned inhibition. These results suggest that the relationship between anxiety and fear learning is complex and warrants further investigation of the potential mediating role of higher-order cognitive faculties.
22088795<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Cognitive-behavioral stress management reverses anxiety-related leukocyte transcriptional dynamics.<<>>BACKGROUND: Chronic threat and anxiety are associated with pro-inflammatory transcriptional profiles in circulating leukocytes, but the causal direction of that relationship has not been established. This study tested whether a cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) intervention targeting negative affect and cognition might counteract anxiety-related transcriptional alterations in people confronting a major medical threat. METHODS: One hundred ninety-nine women undergoing primary treatment of stage 0-III breast cancer were randomized to a 10-week CBSM protocol or an active control condition. Seventy-nine provided peripheral blood leukocyte samples for genome-wide transcriptional profiling and bioinformatic analyses at baseline, 6-month, and 12-month follow-ups. RESULTS: Baseline negative affect was associated with >50% differential expression of 201 leukocyte transcripts, including upregulated expression of pro-inflammatory and metastasis-related genes. CBSM altered leukocyte expression of 91 genes by >50% at follow-up (group x time interaction), including downregulation of pro-inflammatory and metastasis-related genes and upregulation of type I interferon response genes. Promoter-based bioinformatic analyses implicated decreased activity of NF-kappaB/Rel and GATA family transcription factors and increased activity of interferon response factors and the glucocorticoid receptor as potential mediators of CBSM-induced transcriptional alterations. CONCLUSIONS: In early-stage breast cancer patients, a 10-week CBSM intervention can reverse anxiety-related upregulation of pro-inflammatory gene expression in circulating leukocytes. These findings clarify the molecular signaling pathways by which behavioral interventions can influence physical health and alter peripheral inflammatory processes that may reciprocally affect brain affective and cognitive processes.
30863879<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Avoid-approach conflict behaviors differentially affected by anxiolytics: implications for a computational model of risky decision-making.<<>>Whether fear or anxiety is expressed is thought to depend on an animal's proximity to threat. In general, fear is elicited when threat is proximal, while anxiety is a response to threat that is distal and uncertain. This threat gradient model suggests that fear and anxiety involve non-overlapping neural circuitry, yet few behavioral paradigms exist that elicit both states. We studied avoid-approach conflict in rats that were behaving in a predator-inhabited foraging arena task that involved tangible threat and reward incentives. In the task, rats exhibited a variety of both fearful and anxious behaviors corresponding to proximal and distal threat, respectively. We then administered ethanol or diazepam to the rats in order to study how anxiolytics affected these fear and anxiety behaviors. We discovered that both ethanol and diazepam attenuated proximal-threat fear-like behaviors. Furthermore, we found that diazepam, but not ethanol, increased distal-threat anxiety-like behavior but also made rats less risk-averse. Finally, we describe how decisional conflict can be modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process and characterize a potential relationship between anxious behavior, diazepam's ability to suppress hippocampal theta oscillations, and hippocampal representations of the future.
23459454<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Failure to filter: anxious individuals show inefficient gating of threat from working memory.<<>>Dispositional anxiety is a well-established risk factor for the development of psychiatric disorders along the internalizing spectrum, including anxiety and depression. Importantly, many of the maladaptive behaviors characteristic of anxiety, such as anticipatory apprehension, occur when threat is absent. This raises the possibility that anxious individuals are less efficient at gating threat's access to working memory, a limited capacity workspace where information is actively retained, manipulated, and used to flexibly guide goal-directed behavior when it is no longer present in the external environment. Using a well-validated neurophysiological index of working memory storage, we demonstrate that threat-related distracters were difficult to filter on average and that this difficulty was exaggerated among anxious individuals. These results indicate that dispositionally anxious individuals allocate excessive working memory storage to threat, even when it is irrelevant to the task at hand. More broadly, these results provide a novel framework for understanding the maladaptive thoughts and actions characteristic of internalizing disorders.
26651008<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Can anxiety damage the brain?<<>>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Stress exacerbates mental illnesses such as depression but also appears to increase risk of dementia, suggesting a common mechanism for development of stress-induced affective and cognitive impairment. The purpose of this review is to address the question of whether anxiety 'damages' the brain, and to identify potential mechanisms for the link between stress and neuropsychiatric illness. RECENT FINDINGS: Anxiety disorders are associated with alterations in fear neurocircuitry such that 'bottom-up' processes in the amygdala which respond to threat are exaggerated, and regulation of these processes by the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus is impaired. Chronic stress exposure similarly alters fear neurocircuitry by enhancing amygdalar functioning while causing structural degeneration in the PFC and hippocampus thereby inhibiting PFC/hippocampus control over the stress response. Pharmacological (e.g., antidepressant medications) and nonpharmacological interventions (cognitive-behavioral therapy, exercise) may reverse stress-induced damage in the brain. SUMMARY: Pathological anxiety and chronic stress lead to structural degeneration and impaired functioning of the hippocampus and the PFC, which may account for the increased risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and dementia. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether reversal of stress-induced brain changes by interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapy can reduce risk of neuropsychiatric illness.
24095880<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Neuroimaging the temporal dynamics of human avoidance to sustained threat.<<>>Many forms of human psychopathology are characterized by sustained negative emotional responses to threat and chronic behavioral avoidance, implicating avoidance as a potential transdiagnostic factor. Evidence from both nonhuman neurophysiological and human neuroimaging studies suggests a distributed frontal-limbic-striatal brain network supports avoidance. However, our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the network to sustained threat that prompts sustained avoidance is limited. To address this issue, 17 adults were given extensive training on a modified free-operant avoidance task in which button pressing avoided money loss during a sustained threat period. Subsequently, subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while completing the avoidance task. In our regions of interest, we observed phasic, rather than sustained, activation during sustained threat in dorsolateral and inferior frontal regions, anterior and dorsal cingulate, ventral striatum and regions associated with emotion, including the amygdala, insula, substantia nigra and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis complex. Moreover, trait levels of experiential avoidance were negatively correlated with insula, hippocampal and amygdala activation. These findings suggest knowledge that one can consistently avoid aversive outcomes is not associated with decreased threat-related responses and that individuals with greater experiential avoidance exhibit reduced reactivity to initial threat. Implications for understanding brain mechanisms supporting human avoidance and psychological theories of avoidance are discussed.
29709209<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Anxiety, Depression, and Decision Making: A Computational Perspective.<<>>In everyday life, the outcomes of our actions are rarely certain. Further, we often lack the information needed to precisely estimate the probability and value of potential outcomes as well as how much effort will be required by the courses of action under consideration. Under such conditions of uncertainty, individual differences in the estimation and weighting of these variables, and in reliance on model-free versus model-based decision making, have the potential to strongly influence our behavior. Both anxiety and depression are associated with difficulties in decision making. Further, anxiety is linked to increased engagement in threat-avoidance behaviors and depression is linked to reduced engagement in reward-seeking behaviors. The precise deficits, or biases, in decision making associated with these common forms of psychopathology remain to be fully specified. In this article, we review evidence for which of the computations supporting decision making are altered in anxiety and depression and consider the potential consequences for action selection. In addition, we provide a schematic framework that integrates the findings reviewed and will hopefully be of value to future studies.
25981173<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Fear Generalization and Anxiety: Behavioral and Neural Mechanisms.<<>>Fear can be an adaptive emotion that helps defend against potential danger. Classical conditioning models elegantly describe how animals learn which stimuli in the environment signal danger, but understanding how this learning is generalized to other stimuli that resemble aspects of a learned threat remains a challenge. Critically, the overgeneralization of fear to harmless stimuli or situations is a burden to daily life and characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder and other anxiety disorders. Here, we review emerging evidence on behavioral and neural mechanisms of generalization of emotional learning with the goal of encouraging further research on generalization in anxiety disorders. We begin by placing research on fear generalization in a rich historical context of stimulus generalization dating back to Pavlov, which lays the foundation for theoretical and experimental approaches used today. We then transition to contemporary behavioral and neurobiological research on generalization of emotional learning in humans and nonhuman animals and discuss the factors that promote generalization on the one hand from discrimination on the other hand.
23140175<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>The influence of hallucination proneness and social threat on time perception.<<>>INTRODUCTION: Individuals with schizophrenia frequently report disturbances in time perception, but the precise nature of such deficits and their relation to specific symptoms of the disorder is unclear. We sought to determine the relationship between hallucination proneness and time perception in healthy individuals, and whether this relationship is moderated by hypervigilance to threat-related stimuli. METHODS: 206 participants completed the Revised Launay-Slade Hallucination Scale (LSHS-R) and a time reproduction task in which, on each trial, participants viewed a face (happy, angry, neutral, or fearful) for between 1 and 5 s and then reproduced the time period with a spacebar press. RESULTS: High LSHS-R scores were associated with longer time estimates, but only during exposure to angry faces. A factor analysis of LSHS-R scores identified a factor comprising items related to reality monitoring, and this factor was most associated with the longer time estimates. CONCLUSIONS: During exposure to potential threat in the environment, duration estimates increase with hallucination proneness. The experience of feeling exposed to threat for longer may serve to maintain a state of hypervigilance which has been shown previously to be associated with positive symptoms of schizophrenia.
20236791<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>D-cycloserine for the augmentation of an attentional training intervention for trait anxiety.<<>>The present study investigates the combination of two novel strategies for the treatment of anxiety that resulted from translational research. We examined whether the putative memory enhancer, d-cycloserine (DCS), offered benefit to procedures designed to train attention away from threat. Participants were 44 adults selected on the basis of high trait anxiety. In this randomized study, DCS or placebo was administered 1h prior to attentional training away from threat using the dot probe task. On the following day, the effectiveness of this training was assessed along with emotional reactivity following two stressful tasks. We found that the addition of DCS resulted in significantly stronger reduction in attentional bias toward threat relative to placebo, but found no additive effects for the DCS condition on subsequent emotional reactivity. These results provide initial support for the efficacy of DCS for augmenting attentional training tasks; potential strategies for enhancing these results are discussed.
26163715<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Safety Behavior Increases Obsession-Related Cognitions About the Severity of Threat.<<>>This study investigated whether checking behavior, the most common safety behavior in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), contributes to the development of OCD symptoms. Ninety healthy undergraduates spent a week between a pre- and posttest either actively engaging in clinically representative checking behavior on a daily basis (experimental group, n=30), monitoring their normal checking behavior (monitor group, n=30), or received no instructions on checking behavior (control group, n=30). Cognitions about the severity of threat increased from pre- to posttest in the experimental group, but not in the monitor and control groups. Cognitions about the importance of checking decreased in the monitor group. The results indicate that checking behavior contributes directly to the exacerbation of OCD symptoms. Together with the findings of previous studies, this suggests that safety behavior may be involved in the development of anxiety disorders and OCD. Potential mechanisms of how engaging in safety behavior increases threat perception are discussed.
26424424<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Burning odor-elicited anxiety in OEF/OIF combat veterans: Inverse relationship to gray matter volume in olfactory cortex.<<>>Despite the anatomical overlap between the brain's fear/threat and olfactory systems, a very limited number of investigations have considered the role of odors and the central olfactory system in the pathophysiology of PTSD. The goal of the present study was to assess structural differences in primary and secondary olfactory cortex between combat veterans with and without PTSD (CV + PTSD, CV-PTSD, respectively). An additional goal was to determine the relationship between gray matter volume (GMV) in olfactory cortex and the distressing properties of burning-related odors. A region of interest voxel-based morphometric (VBM) approach was used to measure GMV in olfactory cortex in a well-characterized group of CV + PTSD (n = 20) and CV-PTSD (n = 25). Prior to the MRI exam, combat-related (i.e., burning rubber) and control odors were systematically sampled and rated according to their potential for eliciting PTSD symptoms. Results showed that CV + PTSD exhibited significantly reduced GMV in anterior piriform (primary olfactory) and orbitofrontal (secondary olfactory) cortices compared to CV-PTSD (both p < .01). For the entire group, GMV in bilateral anterior piriform cortex was inversely related to burning rubber odor-elicited memories of trauma (p < .05). GMV in orbitofrontal cortex was inversely related to both clinical and laboratory measures of PTSD symptoms (all p < .05). In addition to replicating an established inverse relationship between GMV in anxiety-associated brain structures and PTSD symptomatology, the present study extends those findings by being the first report of volumetric decreases in olfactory cortex that are inversely related to odor-elicited PTSD symptoms. Potential mechanisms underlying these findings are discussed.
20950644<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>There is more than the amygdala: potential threat assessment in the cingulate cortex.<<>>Fear conditioning with its neurological basis in the amygdala and associated structures provides an important model of anxiety disorders. However, this review will argue for a distinction between fear-provoking immediate and anxiety-provoking potential threats, with the amygdala processing immediate threats and the cingulate cortex (and insular) processing potential threats. Four independent but related literatures are reviewed to bolster this argument: (1) rodent remote contextual fear conditioning, (2) symptom provocation in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), (3) fMRI investigations of risk assessment, and (4) behavioural and neurological studies of precautionary reasoning. These four literatures converge in suggesting that the cingulate cortex (and in more specific instances the insula) underlie potential threat assessment, providing support for a number of recent models posting the existence of a separate potential threat system that is dysfunctional in obsessive compulsive disorder (e.g., Szechtman and Woody, 2004; Woody and Szechtman, 2011).
27129732<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Perception of the Threat of Terrorism.<<>>In light of the tense and ongoing security situation in Israel, one important issue that needs to be analyzed and understood is the perception of terrorism threats. Most studies focused mainly on the psychological implications of terrorist acts; this study examines the complexity of the manner in which the individual perceives the threat of terrorism. In all, 40 Israeli adults (22 women and 18 men) were interviewed using semistructured in-depth interviews. Qualitative analysis indicates that the components of the perception of terrorism that construct the evaluation and subjective perception of the participants are as follows: (a) perception of control, which is a feeling of loss of control and helplessness due to uncertainty, inability to predict threats, and the vagueness of the threat; (b) perception of vulnerability to the threat, such as a feeling of vulnerability to and potential victimization by terrorism; and (c) perception of fear of terrorism that includes responses of fear, anxiety, feeling of danger, and emotional distress. In addition, gender differences were found in the analysis. The findings of this study help gain a better understanding as to how people perceive the threat of terrorism. The findings also enable an understanding of the complexity of living under ongoing terrorism threats and may assist in understanding how citizens cope with and adjust to this threat.
29883709<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Fearfulness, neuroticism/anxiety, and COMT Val158Met in long-term fear conditioning and extinction.<<>>Individual differences in long-term stability of fear memories are of potential relevance for stable dispositions related to threat processing, such as neuroticism/anxiety and fearfulness. As previous research suggests a prominent role of dopamine for the retention of conditioned and extinguished fear, dopaminergic gene polymorphisms may also relate to individual differences in fear stability. While the COMT Val158Met polymorphism causes individual differences in prefrontal dopamine, its associations with human long-term fear extinction are currently unknown. Here, n=30/29/28 healthy male Val/Val, Val/Met and Met/Met carriers, respectively, underwent a two-day differential conditioning paradigm with fear acquisition and extinction on Day 1 and a recall test on Day 2 with recordings of EEG and ECG. Fearfulness but not neuroticism/anxiety predicted fear bradycardia (i.e., heart period slowing) during Day 1 fear acquisition while it did not affect extinction or Day 2 fear recall. In contrast, COMT Val158Met significantly modulated Day 2 fear recall as evident in fear bradycardia and Late Positive Potential (LPP) amplitudes while it did not affect Day 1 fear or extinction learning. Furthermore, exploratory analyses revealed that individual differences in fear bradycardia during Day 2 extinction recall depended on Day 1 extinction success. Importantly, this contingency was (a) modulated by COMT Val158Met and (b) significantly reduced in high vs. low neuroticism/anxiety. The present study indicates that (a) individual differences in dopaminergic genotypes may affect the long-term stability of fear memories and (b) fearfulness vs. neuroticism/anxiety might play distinct roles in initial fear reactions vs. long-term stability of fear memories, respectively.
18022310<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Effects of anxiety on the processing of fearful and happy faces: an event-related potential study.<<>>This study investigated the influence of trait anxiety on event-related potentials (ERPs) to fearful, happy, and neutral faces. Fearful faces, relative to neutral, elicited a range of effects in the low-trait anxiety (LTA) group: an enhanced visual P1 component, an early posterior negativity (EPN), and a sustained fronto-central positivity. Emotional expression effects were generally weaker for happy faces. The enhanced fronto-central positivity and EPN triggered by fearful stimuli in LTA participants were less pronounced in the high-trait anxiety (HTA) group, while the enhancement of the visual P1 seen in the LTA group was further augmented in the HTA group. This represents a clear dissociation across anxiety groups between rapid attentional processing as reflected by the visual P1 and later strategic processing as reflected by fronto-central and EPN components. These effects of high-trait anxiety in potentiating initial threat evaluation but attenuating later cognitive processing are discussed in the context of the possible roles of neural systems underlying threat evaluation, cognitive avoidance, and differentiated affective responses.
21355660<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Attachment insecurities and the processing of threat-related information: Studying the schemas involved in insecure people's coping strategies.<<>>In 6 studies we examined procedural, scriptlike knowledge associated with 2 different kinds of attachment insecurity: anxiety and avoidance. The studies examined associations between attachment insecurities, the cognitive accessibility of sentinel and rapid fight-flight schemas, and the extent to which these schemas guide the processing of threat-related information and actual behavior during an experimentally induced threatening event. Anxious attachment was associated with (a) greater accessibility of the sentinel schema in narratives of threatening events; (b) faster, deeper, and more schema-biased processing of information about components of the sentinel schema; and (c) quicker detection of a threat. Avoidant attachment was associated with greater accessibility of the rapid fight-flight schema in narratives of threatening events and faster, deeper, and more schema-biased processing of information about components of the schema. We discuss implications of the findings for understanding the cognitive aspects of insecure people's coping strategies in threatening situations, as well as the potential benefits of these strategies to the people who enact them and to the groups to which they belong.
30661553<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Attention Bias Modification Treatment for Adolescents With Social Anxiety Disorder.<<>>Social anxiety disorder (SAD) tends to emerge during the early teenage years and is particularly refractory to change even when standard evidence-based CBT treatments are delivered. Efforts have been made to develop novel, mechanistic-driven interventions for this disorder. In the present study, we examined Attention Bias Modification Treatment (ABMT) for youth with SAD. Participants were 58 adolescents (mean age = 14.29 years) who met diagnostic criteria for SAD and who were randomized to ABMT or a placebo control condition, Attention Control Training (ACT). We predicted that ABMT would result in greater changes in both threat biases and social anxiety symptoms. We also explored potential moderators of change including the severity of social anxiety symptoms, the level of threat bias at pretreatment, and the degree of temperament-defined attention control. Contrary to our hypotheses, changes in attention bias were not observed in either condition, changes in social anxiety symptoms and diagnosis were small, and significant differences were not observed between the ABMT and ACT conditions. Little support for the proposed moderators was obtained. Reasons for our failure to find support for ABMT and its potential moderators are explored and recommendations for changes in the ABMT paradigm are suggested.
26631147<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Vestibulo-spinal and vestibulo-ocular reflexes are modulated when standing with increased postural threat.<<>>We investigated how vestibulo-spinal reflexes (VSRs) and vestibulo-ocular reflexes (VORs) measured through vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) and video head impulse test (vHIT) outcomes, respectively, are modulated during standing under conditions of increased postural threat. Twenty-five healthy young adults stood quietly at low (0.8 m from the ground) and high (3.2 m) surface height conditions in two experiments. For the first experiment (n = 25) VEMPs were recorded with surface EMG from inferior oblique (IO), sternocleidomastoid (SCM), trapezius (TRP), and soleus (SOL) muscles in response to 256 air-conducted short tone bursts (125 dB SPL, 500 Hz, 4 ms) delivered via headphones. A subset of subjects (n = 19) also received horizontal and vertical head thrusts ( approximately 150 degrees /s) at each height in a separate session, comparing eye and head velocities by using a vHIT system for calculating the functional VOR gains. VEMP amplitudes (IO, TRP, SOL) and horizontal and vertical vHIT gains all increased with high surface height conditions (P < 0.05). Changes in IO and SCM VEMP amplitudes as well as horizontal vHIT gains were correlated with changes in electrodermal activity (rho = 0.44-0.59, P < 0.05). VEMP amplitude for the IO also positively correlated with fear (rho = 0.43, P = 0.03). Threat-induced anxiety, fear, and arousal have significant effects on VSR and VOR gains that can be observed in both physiological and functional outcome measures. These findings provide support for a potential central modulation of the vestibular nucleus complex through excitatory inputs from neural centers involved in processing fear, anxiety, arousal, and vigilance.
18208937<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Effects of threat of electric shock and diazepam on the N1/P2 auditory-evoked potential elicited by low-intensity auditory stimuli.<<>>The acoustic startle response includes rapid muscular contractions elicited by loud sounds; it may be measured in humans as the electromyographic response of the orbicularis oculi muscle. Enhancement of this response during exposure to threat of electric shock (fear- potentiated startle) is a widely used model of human anxiety. A problem with the use of the startle reflex in studies of human anxiety is the aversiveness of startle-eliciting sounds, which may, in some subjects, exceed the aversiveness of the electric shock itself. We have recently found that the long-latency N1/P2 auditory-evoked potential elicited by loud sounds is subject to fear potentiation. However, it is not known whether N1/P2 potentials elicited by low-intensity sounds, which do not elicit the startle response, are also subject to fear potentiation. This study examined the susceptibility of the N1/P2 potential elicited by low-intensity sounds to fear potentiation, and the effect of the anxiolytic diazepam on the N1/P2 potential in the absence and presence of threat of electric shock. Fifteen male volunteers (18-43 years) participated in three sessions in which they received placebo, diazepam 5 mg and diazepam 10 mg according to a double-blind protocol. Sixty minutes after treatment, auditory-evoked potentials were elicited by 40 ms 1 kHz tones 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 dB[A] above a background of 70 dB[A]. Recording sessions consisted of eight alternating 2 min THREAT and SAFE blocks; unpredictable shocks (1.8 mA, 50 ms) were delivered to the subject's wrist in THREAT blocks (1-4 shocks per block). The amplitude of the N1/P2 potential increased monotonically as a function of stimulus intensity. The responses were significantly greater during THREAT blocks than during SAFE blocks (fear potentiation). Diazepam attenuated the responses in both the SAFE and THREAT conditions. Fear potentiation of the N1/P2 potential was significantly reduced by diazepam. Diazepam reduced subjective alertness and lowered critical flicker fusion frequency, a measure of arousal. The results suggest that fear potentiation of the N1/P2 potential is not simply a manifestation of the fear-potentiated startle response. The use of low-intensity stimuli may be advantageous in studies of fear potentiation in humans.
26708107<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Prefrontal Reactivity to Social Signals of Threat as a Predictor of Treatment Response in Anxious Youth.<<>>Neuroimaging has shown promise as a tool to predict likelihood of treatment response in adult anxiety disorders, with potential implications for clinical decision-making. Despite the relatively high prevalence and emergence of anxiety disorders in youth, very little work has evaluated neural predictors of response to treatment. The goal of the current study was to examine brain function during emotional face processing as a predictor of response to treatment in children and adolescents (age 7-19 years; N=41) with generalized, social, and/or separation anxiety disorder. Prior to beginning treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) sertraline or cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), participants completed an emotional faces matching task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Whole brain responses to threatening (ie, angry and fearful) and happy faces were examined as predictors of change in anxiety severity following treatment. Greater activation in inferior and superior frontal gyri, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as precentral/postcentral gyri during processing of threatening faces predicted greater response to CBT and SSRI treatment. For processing of happy faces, activation in postcentral gyrus was a significant predictor of treatment response. Post-hoc analyses indicated that effects were not significantly moderated by type of treatment. Findings suggest that greater activation in prefrontal regions involved in appraising and regulating responses to social signals of threat predict better response to SSRI and CBT treatment in anxious youth and that neuroimaging may be a useful tool for predicting how youth will respond to treatment.
27462211<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) of the Right Inferior Frontal Gyrus Attenuates Skin Conductance Responses to Unpredictable Threat Conditions.<<>>Patients with panic and post-traumatic stress disorders seem to show increased psychophysiological reactions to conditions of unpredictable (U) threat, which has been discussed as a neurobiological marker of elevated levels of sustained fear in these disorders. Interestingly, a recent study found that the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) is correlated to the successful regulation of sustained fear during U threat. Therefore this study aimed to examine the potential use of non-invasive brain stimulation to foster the rIFG by means of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in order to reduce psychophysiological reactions to U threat. Twenty six participants were randomly assigned into an anodal and sham stimulation group in a double-blinded manner. Anodal and cathodal electrodes (7 * 5 cm) were positioned right frontal to target the rIFG. Stimulation intensity was I = 2 mA applied for 20 min during a task including U threat conditions (NPU-task). The effects of the NPU paradigm were measured by assessing the emotional startle modulation and the skin conductance response (SCR) at the outset of the different conditions. We found a significant interaction effect of condition x tDCS for the SCR (F (2,48) = 6.3, p < 0.01) without main effects of condition and tDCS. Post hoc tests revealed that the increase in SCR from neutral (N) to U condition was significantly reduced in verum compared to the sham tDCS group (t (24) = 3.84, p < 0.001). Our results emphasize the causal role of rIFG for emotional regulation and the potential use of tDCS to reduce apprehension during U threat conditions and therefore as a treatment for anxiety disorders.
28787685<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Impact of low-dose chronic exposure to Bisphenol A (BPA) on adult male zebrafish adaption to the environmental complexity: Disturbing the color preference patterns and reliving the anxiety behavior.<<>>The extensive usage of xenobiotic endocrine disrupting chemicals (XEDCs), such as Bisphenol A (BPA), has created obvious threat to aquatic ecosystems worldwide. Although a comprehensive understanding of the adverse effect of BPA on behaviors and physiology have been proven, the potential impact of low-dose BPA on altering the basic ability of aquatic organism in adapting to the surrounded complex environment still remains elusive. In this research, we report that treatment of adult male zebrafish with chronic (7 weeks) low-dose (0.22 nM-2.2 nM) BPA, altered the ability in adapting the complex environment by disturbing the natural color preference patterns. In addition, chronic 50 ng/L (0.22 nM) BPA exposure alleviated the anxiety behavior of male zebrafish confronted with the novel environment by enhancing the preference towards light in the light/dark preference test. This phenotype was associated with less expression of serotonin (5-TH) in the hypothalamus and the down-regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in brain tissues. As such, our results show that low-dose BPA remnant in surface waters altered zebrafish behavior that are known to have ecological and evolutionary consequences. HIGHLIGHTS: Here we reported that the impact of chronic low-dose BPA exposure on the basic capability of zebrafish to adapt to the environmental complexity. Specifically, BPA at low concentration, under the environmental safety level and 3000-fold lower than the accepted human daily exposure, interfered with the ability to discriminate color and alleviate anxiety induced by the novel environment, which finally altered the capability of male zebrafish to adapt to the environmental complexity. These findings revealed the ecological effect of low-dose BPA and regular BPA concentration standard are not necessarily safe. The result also provided the consideration of retuning the hazard concentration level of BPA.
24782804<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Electrophysiological evidence of the time course of attentional bias in non-patients reporting symptoms of depression with and without co-occurring anxiety.<<>>Anxiety is characterized by attentional biases to threat, but findings are inconsistent for depression. To address this inconsistency, the present study systematically assessed the role of co-occurring anxiety in attentional bias in depression. In addition, the role of emotional valence, arousal, and gender was explored. Ninety-two non-patients completed the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (Meyer et al., 1990; Molina and Borkovec, 1994) and portions of the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (Watson et al., 1995a,1995b). Individuals reporting high levels of depression and low levels of anxiety (depression only), high levels of depression and anxiety (combined), or low levels of both (control) completed an emotion-word Stroop task during event-related brain potential recording. Pleasant and unpleasant words were matched on emotional arousal level. An attentional bias was not evident in the depression-only group. Women in the combined group had larger N200 amplitude for pleasant than unpleasant stimuli, and the combined group as a whole had larger right-lateralized P300 amplitude for pleasant than unpleasant stimuli, consistent with an early and later attentional bias that is specific to unpleasant valence in the combined group. Men in the control group had larger N200 amplitude for pleasant than unpleasant stimuli, consistent with an early attentional bias that is specific to pleasant valence. The present study indicates that the nature and time course of attention prompted by emotional valence and not arousal differentiates depression with and without anxiety, with some evidence of gender moderating early effects. Overall, results suggest that co-occurring anxiety is more important than previously acknowledged in demonstrating evidence of attentional biases in depression.
29086243<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>A Live Threat Violence Simulation Exercise for Psychiatric Outpatient Departments: A Valuable Aid to Training in Violence Prevention.<<>>OBJECTIVE: Violence in psychiatric outpatient settings is a ubiquitous concern. This article describes the development, implementation, and evaluation of a live threat violence simulation exercise, designed to reduce the risk of future outpatient clinic violence and minimize the effects of future incidents on staff. METHODS: The psychiatric outpatient clinic at the University of Colorado Hospital developed, implemented, and evaluated a 4-hour live violence threat simulation exercise as a companion to a 7-hour violence prevention program. The simulation includes an orientation, two threat simulation scenarios, three debriefings, satisfaction surveys, problem identification, action plans, and annual safety and process improvements. RESULTS: The authors have conducted live violence simulation exercises from 2011-2016, and have collected survey data about our annual simulation exercise from 2014-2016. Each year >/= 52% of participants responded, and each year >/= 90% of respondents rated the simulation as "very helpful/helpful", >/= 86% believed themselves to be "much better/better" prepared to deal with violent episodes, and < 2% of participants experienced post-simulation side effects such as worries about past trauma; anxiety; sleep problems; increase in workplace concerns. From 2011-2016, the clinic experienced 4 major violent episodes and 36 episodes of potential violence with no staff injuries and minimal psychological sequelae to one staff member. Violence prevention efforts and the development of close police/staff relationships may have contributed to these fortunate outcomes. CONCLUSION: Satisfaction surveys suggest that the simulations are very helpful/helpful, with participants feeling much better/ better prepared to manage violence. The exercises led the authors to initiate staff safety related behavioral changes as well as physical space and safety processes improvements. The violence prevention program and simulation exercises have promoted excellent relationships with police and a consistent safety record over six years. This approach may be useful for other psychiatric outpatient departments.
22412135<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Evidence-based treatment of anxiety in patients with cancer.<<>>UNLABELLED: Anxiety is a dynamic response to perceived threat that is common among patients with cancer and fluctuates at critical points in the disease trajectory. A substantial minority of patients may experience clinically significant anxiety resulting from a range of potential etiologic factors. This review summarizes evidence-based recommendations for treatment of anxiety in oncology settings. Recommendations are based on the nature and time course of anxiety and the results of meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and individual trials in cancer populations. The evidence-based literature supports the use of psychosocial and psychopharmacologic treatments to prevent or alleviate anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: are tempered by study heterogeneity and methodologic limitations and a lack of trials that included patients with clinically significant anxiety. In oncology settings, accessibility and acceptability of evidence-based treatments vary, and patients may seek a variety of resources to manage cancer concerns. Treatment planning should incorporate contributing factors to anxiety and patient preferences for psychiatric care.
26442769<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Dealing with negative stereotypes in sports: the role of cognitive anxiety when multiple identities are activated in sensorimotor tasks.<<>>Based on research on stereotype threat and multiple identities, this work explores the beneficial effects of activating a positive social identity when a negative identity is salient on women's performance in sports. Further, in line with research on the effects of anxiety in sports, we investigate whether the activation of a positive social identity buffers performance from cognitive anxiety associated with a negative stereotype. Two experiments tested these predictions in field settings. Experiment 1 (N = 83) shows that the simultaneous activation of a positive (i.e., member of a soccer team) and a negative social identity (i.e., woman) led to better performance than the activation of only a negative social identity for female soccer players. Experiment 2 (N = 46) demonstrates that identity condition moderated the effect of cognitive anxiety on performance for female basketball players. Results are discussed concerning multiple identities' potential for dealing with stressful situations.
22103578<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Threat and defense as goal regulation: from implicit goal conflict to anxious uncertainty, reactive approach motivation, and ideological extremism.<<>>Four studies investigated a goal regulation view of anxious uncertainty threat (Gray & McNaughton, 2000) and ideological defense. Participants (N = 444) were randomly assigned to have achievement or relationship goals implicitly primed. The implicit goal primes were followed by randomly assigned achievement or relationship threats that have reliably caused generalized, reactive approach motivation and ideological defense in past research. The threats caused anxious uncertainty (Study 1), reactive approach motivation (Studies 2 and 3), and reactive ideological conviction (Study 4) only when threat-relevant goals had first been primed, but not when threat-irrelevant goals had first been primed. Reactive ideological conviction (Study 4) was eliminated if participants were given an opportunity to attribute their anxiety to a mundane source. Results support a goal regulation view of anxious uncertainty, threat, and defense with potential for integrating theories of defensive compensation.
29057552<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Children prenatally exposed to maternal anxiety devote more attentional resources to neutral pictures.<<>>Maternal anxiety during pregnancy can negatively affect fetal neurodevelopment, predisposing the offspring to a higher risk of behavioral and emotional problems later in life. The current study investigates the association between maternal anxiety during pregnancy and child affective picture processing using event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Mothers reported anxiety during the second trimester using the anxiety subscale of the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90). At age 4 years, child affective picture processing (N = 86) was measured by recording ERPs during viewing of neutral, pleasant, and unpleasant pictures selected from the International Affective Pictures System. The late positive potential (LPP)-an ERP component reflecting individual differences in affective processing-was used as child outcome. The expected positive association between maternal anxiety and LPP amplitude for unpleasant pictures was not found. Nevertheless, we found a positive association between maternal anxiety during pregnancy and LPP amplitudes for neutral pictures in the middle and late time window at anterior locations (all p < .05). These associations remained significant after adjusting for maternal postnatal anxiety and gestational age at birth and after FDR correction for multiple comparisons. Our study provides neurophysiological evidence that children prenatally exposed to higher maternal anxiety devote more attentional resources to neutral pictures, but not to unpleasant pictures. Possibly, these children show enhanced vigilance for threat when viewing neutral pictures. Although useful in dangerous environments, this enhanced vigilance may predispose children prenatally exposed to higher maternal anxiety to developing behavioral and/or emotional problems later in life.

31001846<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>When stereotype threat makes me more or less intelligent: The informative role of emotions in effort mobilization and task performance.<<>>Studies have shown that affective states could be used as diagnostic information for the assessment of situational demands and that, as such, they can regulate resource mobilization. Accordingly, it was found that negative feelings cause overestimation of situational demands, which then leads to effort mobilization during performance on easy tasks but disengagement on difficult tasks. The present research investigated whether this emotion-motivation link could explain the usual differences in achievement on easy and difficult tasks under stereotype threat (ST). In Study 1, participants in ST, no-ST, and no-ST with fear induction conditions had to resolve a series of easy logical problems. As expected, ST and no-ST-fear groups reported higher effort investment and achieved better performance than the no-ST group. In the following two studies, the no-ST-fear condition was replaced by an ST condition in which the informative potential of threat-related feelings was prevented before the task performance. Although participants under ST reported similar elevation in anxiety, the expected increase in easy task performance (Study 2) and decrease in difficult task performance (Study 3) were observed only in the standard ST groups. Taken together, our findings suggest that threat-related feelings could govern motivational processes and account for the effect of ST.
30649926<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Anxiety-Linked Attentional Bias: Is It Reliable?<<>>There is substantial evidence that heightened anxiety vulnerability is characterized by increased selective attention to threatening information. The reliability of this anxiety-linked attentional bias has become the focus of considerable recent interest. We distinguish between the potential inconsistency of anxiety-linked attentional bias and inconsistency potentially reflecting the psychometric properties of the assessment approaches used to measure it. Though groups with heightened anxiety vulnerability often exhibit, on average, elevated attention to threat, the evidence suggests that individuals are unlikely to each display a stable, invariant attentional bias to threat. Moreover, although existing assessment approaches can differentiate between groups, they do not exhibit the internal consistency or test-retest reliability necessary to classify individuals in terms of their characteristic pattern of attentional responding to threat. We discuss the appropriate uses of existing attentional bias assessment tasks and propose strategies for enhancing classification of individuals in terms of their tendency to display an attentional bias to threat.
30428152<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Intergenerational transmission of attentional bias and anxiety.<<>>Earlier evidence has revealed a bi-directional causal relationship between anxiety and attention biases in adults and children. This study investigated the prospective and concurrent relations between anxiety and attentional bias in a sample of 89 families (mothers, fathers, and first-born children). Parents' and children's attentional bias was measured when children were 7.5 years old, using both a visual probe task and visual search task with angry versus happy facial expressions. Generalized and social anxiety symptoms in parents and children were measured when children were 4.5 and 7.5 years old. Anxiety in parents and children was prospectively (but not concurrently) related to their respective attentional biases to threat: All participants showed a larger attentional bias to threat in the visual search (but not in the visual probe) task if they were more anxious at the 4.5 (but not at the 7.5) year measurement. Moreover, parents' anxiety levels were prospectively predictive of the visual search attentional bias of their children after controlling for child anxiety. More anxiety in mothers at 4.5 years was related to a faster detection of angry among happy faces, while more anxiety in fathers predicted a faster detection of happy among angry faces in children at 7.5 years. We found no direct association between parental and child attentional biases. Our study contributes to the recently emerging literature on attentional biases as a potential mechanism in the intergenerational transmission of anxiety by showing that parents' anxiety rather than parents' attentional bias contributes to the intergenerational transmission of risk for child anxiety.
30683681<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Chronic Suppression of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor (GLP1R) mRNA Translation in the Rat Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis Reduces Anxiety-Like Behavior and Stress-Induced Hypophagia, But Prolongs Stress-Induced Elevation of Plasma Corticosterone.<<>>The anterior lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (alBST) expresses glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors (GLP1Rs) and receives input from caudal brainstem GLP1 neurons. GLP1 administered centrally reduces food intake and increases anxiety-like behavior and plasma corticosterone (cort) levels in rats, whereas central GLP1R antagonism has opposite effects. Anxiogenic threats and other stressors robustly activate c-fos expression in both GLP1-producing neurons and also in neurons within alBST subregions expressing GLP1R. To examine the functional role of GLP1R signaling within the alBST, adult male Sprague Dawley rats received bilateral alBST-targeted injections of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to knock down the translation of GLP1R mRNA (GLP1R-KD rats), or similar injections of a control AAV (CTRL rats). In situ hybridization revealed that GLP1R mRNA is expressed in a subset of GABAergic alBST neurons, and quantitative real-time PCR confirmed that GLP1R-KD rats displayed a significant 60% reduction in translatable GLP1R mRNA. Compared with CTRL rats, GLP1R-KD rats gained more body weight over time and displayed less anxiety-like behavior, including a loss of light-enhanced acoustic startle and less stress-induced hypophagia. Conversely, while baseline plasma cort levels were similar in GLP1R-KD and CTRL rats, GLP1R-KD rats displayed a prolonged stress-induced elevation of plasma cort levels. GLP1R-KD and CTRL rats displayed similar home cage food intake and a similar hypophagic response to systemic Exendin-4, a GLP1R agonist that crosses the blood-brain barrier. We conclude that GLP1R expressed within the alBST contributes to multiple behavioral responses to anxiogenic threats, yet also serves to limit the plasma cort response to acute stress.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Anxiety is an affective and physiological state that supports threat avoidance. Identifying the neural bases of anxiety-like behaviors in animal models is essential for understanding mechanisms that contribute to normative and pathological anxiety in humans. In rats, anxiety/avoidance behaviors can be elicited or enhanced by visceral or cognitive threats that increase glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) signaling from the caudal brainstem to the hypothalamus and limbic forebrain. Data reported here support a role for limbic GLP1 receptor signaling to enhance anxiety-like behavior and to attenuate stress-induced elevations in plasma cort levels in rats. Improved understanding of central GLP1 neural pathways that impact emotional responses to stress could expand potential therapeutic options for anxiety and other stress-related disorders in humans.
23333155<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Testosterone modulation of anxiety in gonadally-suppressed male rhesus monkeys: a role for gonadotropins?<<>>Testosterone (T) has repeatedly been shown to have anxiolytic properties in rodents, but findings in primates are more mixed. To examine the effects of exogenous T on anxiety, we tested pharmacologically-castrated adult male rhesus monkeys in a modified version of the Human Intruder Paradigm, which measured defensive responses to an unfamiliar human staring directly at them for 2 min. Monkeys were tested at 2 week intervals during 4 experimental conditions lasting 4 weeks each: at baseline, during treatment with the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist leuprolide acetate (200 mug/kg; Lupron phase), during treatment with Lupron+T enanthate (TE, 5 mg/kg; TE phase) and during treatment with Lupron+oil vehicle (oil phase). We found that the number of anxious behaviors was lower during periods of low T (Lupron only and Lupron+oil phases) than during the Lupron+TE phase. No change in pacing or watching behavior was observed. Thus, in contrast to rodent data, we found no evidence for anxiolytic properties of T in male rhesus monkeys. Rather, T supplementation restored baseline levels of anxiety in Lupron-treated monkeys. These discrepant findings may be best explained by the low levels of gonadotropins achieved by the GnRH agonist. We suggest that Lupron-induced luteinizing hormone (LH) suppression reduced anxiety and that this effect was abolished by T administration. This interpretation is consistent with the view that T increases emotional reactivity to a potential threat and facilitates adaptive arousal response in face of immediate social challenge.
29332026<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Medicinal Plant Materials in the Treatment of Anxiety Disorders: Neurobiological Aspects.<<>>Context: Pathological anxiety, which affects approximately one-third of the world population, is an inadequate, irrational reaction of an organism to the environment and to a potential threat. Despite advancements in pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders, further studies are still necessary to search for new substances possessing the desired anxiolytic effects, with as few unwanted effects as possible. Objective: This study intended to examine the characteristics of medicinal plant materials that exhibit anxiolytic properties, with a special emphasis on the mechanisms of action of their active ingredients on the systems involved in the pathophysiology of anxiety. Design: The research team performed a review of the literature, searching well-known online scientific databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Medline, ScienceDirect, and SpringerLink. The team searched for the newest research from various regions of the world. Setting: The study was done in the Medical University of Silesia (Katowice, Poland). Results: The medicinal plant materials presented in the current article undoubtedly influence the central nervous system. Our analysis showed that their mechanism of action is very complicated and appropriately still enigmatic. Among them, V officinalis represents the most thoroughly investigated medicinal plant material that produces anxiolytic, sedative effects. However, extracts of other medicinal plants may also emerge as helpful in the treatment of fear and anxiety and in the prophylaxis of those disorders. Conclusions: The current review discusses the most recent data on medicinal plant materials that are effective as anxiolytic treatments, with special emphasis on the neurobiological mechanisms of action of their active ingredients. The research team hopes that the information may open up new directions in the search for drugs capable of enhancing the existing therapy.
23148783<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>A psychophysiological investigation of threat and reward sensitivity in individuals with panic disorder and/or major depressive disorder.<<>>Heightened sensitivity to threat and reduced sensitivity to reward are potential mechanisms of dysfunction in anxiety and depressive disorders, respectively. However, few studies have simultaneously examined whether these mechanisms are unique or common to these disorders. In this study, sensitivity to predictable and unpredictable threat (measured by startle response during threat anticipation) and sensitivity to reward (measured by frontal electroencephalographic [EEG] asymmetry during reward anticipation) were assessed in 4 groups (N = 191): those with (1) panic disorder (PD) without a lifetime history of depression, (2) major depression (MDD) without a lifetime history of an anxiety disorder, (3) comorbid PD and MDD, and (4) controls. General distress/negative temperament (NT) was also assessed via self-report. Results indicated that PD (with or without comorbid MDD) was uniquely associated with heightened startle to predictable and unpredictable threat, and MDD (with or without comorbid PD) was uniquely associated with reduced frontal EEG asymmetry. Both psychophysiological measures of threat and reward sensitivity were stable on retest approximately 9 days later in a subsample of participants. Whereas the comorbid group did not respond differently on the tasks relative to the PD-only and MDD-only groups, they did report greater NT than these 2 groups (which did not differ from each other). Results suggest that heightened sensitivity to threat and reduced sensitivity to reward may be specific components of PD and MDD, respectively. In addition, relative to noncomorbid depression and PD, comorbid MDD and PD may be characterized by heightened NT, but not abnormal levels of these "specific" components.
25548107<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Cannabinoid modulation of amygdala subregion functional connectivity to social signals of threat.<<>>BACKGROUND: Delta(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol has been shown to modulate anxiety and facilitate the extinction of fear by inhibiting amygdala reactivity. Since functional coupling between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex is implicated in affective processes, it is possible that Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol affects amygdala-prefrontal cortex functional connectivity in ways that differ across amygdala subregions: basolateral, centromedial, and superficial. METHODS: The aim of the study was to examine the effects of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol on functional connectivity between amygdala subregions and the prefrontal cortex during socio-emotional threat in healthy adults using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design. Sixteen subjects completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging task designed to probe amygdala responses to social threat. Amygdala subregion-prefrontal cortex functional connectivity was compared between Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol and placebo using generalized psychophysiological interaction analyses. RESULTS: Findings indicated that Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol enhanced basolateral and superficial amygdala connectivity to the rostral anterior cingulate/medial prefrontal cortex. CONCLUSION: These effects, including Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol's potential ability to reduce threat perception or enhance socio-emotional regulation, may help understand the neurocircuitry of affect.
25039035<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Fear of evaluation in social anxiety: mediation of attentional bias to human faces.<<>>Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a debilitating psychological disorder characterised by excessive fears of one or more social or performance situations, where there is potential for evaluation by others. A recently expanded cognitive-behavioural model of SAD emphasizes that both the fear of negative evaluation (FNE) and the fear of positive evaluation (FPE) contribute to enduring symptoms of SAD. Research also suggests that socially anxious individuals may show biases toward threat relevant stimuli, such as angry faces. The current study utilised a modified version of the pictorial dot-probe task in order to examine whether FNE and FPE mediate the relationship between social anxiety and an attentional bias. A group of 38 participants with moderate to high levels of self-reported social anxiety were tested in groups of two to four people and were advised that they would be required to deliver an impromptu speech. All participants then completed an assessment of attentional bias using angry-neutral, happy-neutral, and angry-happy face pairs. Conditions were satisfied for only one mediation model, indicating that the relationship between social anxiety and attentional avoidance of angry faces was mediated by FPE. These findings have important clinical implications for types of treatment concerning cognitive symptoms of SAD, along with advancing models of social anxiety. Limitations and ideas for future research from the current study were also discussed.
27819443<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Error-related brain activity is related to aversive potentiation of the startle response in children, but only the ERN is associated with anxiety disorders.<<>>Identifying biomarkers that characterize developmental trajectories leading to anxiety disorders will likely improve early intervention strategies as well as increase our understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these disorders. The error-related negativity (ERN), an event-related potential that occurs during error commission, is increased in anxious adults and children-and has been shown to predict the onset of anxiety disorders across childhood. The ERN has therefore been suggested as a biomarker of anxiety. However, it remains unclear what specific processes a potentiated ERN may reflect. We have recently proposed that the ERN may reflect trait-like differences in threat sensitivity; however, very few studies have examined the ERN in relation to other indices of this construct. In the current study, the authors measured the ERN, as well as affective modulation of the startle reflex, in a large sample (N = 155) of children. Children characterized by a large ERN also exhibited greater potentiation of the startle response in the context of unpleasant images, but not in the context of neutral or pleasant images. In addition, the ERN, but not startle response, related to child anxiety disorder status. These results suggest a relationship between error-related brain activity and aversive potentiation of the startle reflex during picture viewing-consistent with the notion that both measures may reflect individual differences in threat sensitivity. However, results suggest the ERN may be a superior biomarker of anxiety in children. (PsycINFO Database Record
29550689<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Rethinking avoidance: Toward a balanced approach to avoidance in treating anxiety disorders.<<>>Avoidance is typically considered a maladaptive behavioral response to excessive fear and anxiety, leading to the maintenance of anxiety disorders. Exposure is a core element of cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders. One important aspect of this treatment is repeated and prolonged exposure to a threat while discouraging patients from using avoidance strategies, such as escape or safety behaviors. We will first revisit the role of avoidance learning in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders, including important insights from the neuroscience literature. Next, we will consider both the negative and positive aspects of avoidance for therapeutic interventions. Finally, we will explore the application of adaptive avoidance in exposure therapy for anxiety disorders. We will argue that there are occasions when avoidance behaviors can serve as effective coping strategies to enhance the person's perception of control over the environment and the potential threat. We conclude that avoidance behaviors can be a valuable therapeutic element, depending on the function of these behaviors.
28268274<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Virtual reality applications in assessing the effect of anxiety on sensorimotor integration in human postural control.<<>>Falls are a leading cause of injury and mortality among adults over the age of 65 years. Given the strong relation between fear of falling and fall risk, identification of the mechanisms that underlie anxiety-related changes in postural control may pave the way to the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing fall risk in older adults. First, we review potential mechanisms underlying anxiety-mediated changes in postural control in older adults with and without neurological conditions. We then present a system that allows for the simultaneous recording of neural, physiological, and behavioral data in an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment while implementing sensory and mechanical perturbations to evaluate alterations in sensorimotor integration under conditions with high postural threat. We also discuss applications of VR in minimizing falls in older adults and potential future studies.
25326039<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Attachment-security priming attenuates amygdala activation to social and linguistic threat.<<>>A predominant expectation that social relationships with others are safe (a secure attachment style), has been linked with reduced threat-related amygdala activation. Experimental priming of mental representations of attachment security can modulate neural responding, but the effects of attachment-security priming on threat-related amygdala activation remains untested. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the present study examined the effects of trait and primed attachment security on amygdala reactivity to threatening stimuli in an emotional faces and a linguistic dot-probe task in 42 healthy participants. Trait attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance were positively correlated with amygdala activation to threatening faces in the control group, but not in the attachment primed group. Furthermore, participants who received attachment-security priming showed attenuated amygdala activation in both the emotional faces and dot-probe tasks. The current findings demonstrate that variation in state and trait attachment security modulates amygdala reactivity to threat. These findings support the potential use of attachment security-boosting methods as interventions and suggest a neural mechanism for the protective effect of social bonds in anxiety disorders.
22129663<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Limited transfer of threat bias following attentional retraining.<<>>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Anxiety-related attentional bias for threat is considered an important risk factor for the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders. In line with this idea, recent studies have illustrated that experimentally induced changes in attentional bias have an impact on both non-clinical and clinical levels of anxiety. Still, little is known about the potential transfer of computerized training of attention to different components of attentional processing of threat. METHODS: In the present study, we trained participants to either avoid or attend towards threatening pictures in a dot probe task, and we examined whether this attentional training transferred to a measure of emotional interference. RESULTS: Despite our successful manipulation of attentional bias in the dot probe task, we found no generalization of the attentional training to the interference task. LIMITATIONS: It is possible that our study lacked statistical power to reveal possible group differences in the interference task. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that attentional training using the dot probe task may influence the amount of attention that is given to the spatial location of threat, but not necessarily the amount of attention that is given to the semantic content of stimuli.
29615092<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Improving the effectiveness of psychological interventions for depression and anxiety in the cardiac rehabilitation pathway using group-based metacognitive therapy (PATHWAY Group MCT): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.<<>>BACKGROUND: Anxiety and depression are prevalent among cardiac rehabilitation patients but pharmacological and psychological treatments have limited effectiveness in this group. Furthermore, psychological interventions have not been systematically integrated into cardiac rehabilitation services despite being a strategic priority for the UK National Health Service. A promising new treatment, metacognitive therapy, may be well-suited to the needs of cardiac rehabilitation patients and has the potential to improve outcomes. It is based on the metacognitive model, which proposes that a thinking style dominated by rumination, worry and threat monitoring maintains emotional distress. Metacognitive therapy is highly effective at reducing this thinking style and alleviating anxiety and depression in mental health settings. This trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of group-based metacognitive therapy for cardiac rehabilitation patients with elevated anxiety and/or depressive symptoms. METHODS/DESIGN: The PATHWAY Group-MCT trial is a multicentre, two-arm, single-blind, randomised controlled trial comparing the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of group-based metacognitive therapy plus usual cardiac rehabilitation to usual cardiac rehabilitation alone. Cardiac rehabilitation patients (target sample n = 332) with elevated anxiety and/or depressive symptoms will be recruited across five UK National Health Service Trusts. Participants randomised to the intervention arm will receive six weekly sessions of group-based metacognitive therapy delivered by either cardiac rehabilitation professionals or research nurses. The intervention and control groups will both be offered the usual cardiac rehabilitation programme within their Trust. The primary outcome is severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms at 4-month follow-up measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total score. Secondary outcomes are severity of anxiety/depression at 12-month follow-up, health-related quality of life, severity of post-traumatic stress symptoms and strength of metacognitive beliefs at 4- and 12-month follow-up. Qualitative interviews will help to develop an account of barriers and enablers to the effectiveness of the intervention. DISCUSSION: This trial will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of group-based metacognitive therapy in alleviating anxiety and depression in cardiac rehabilitation patients. The therapy, if effective, offers the potential to improve psychological wellbeing and quality of life in this large group of patients.

30699438<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Real-Time Functional Connectivity-Informed Neurofeedback of Amygdala-Frontal Pathways Reduces Anxiety.<<>>BACKGROUND: Deficient emotion regulation and exaggerated anxiety represent a major transdiagnostic psychopathological marker. On the neural level these deficits have been closely linked to impaired, yet treatment-sensitive, prefrontal regulatory control over the amygdala. Gaining direct control over these pathways could therefore provide an innovative and promising intervention to regulate exaggerated anxiety. To this end the current proof-of-concept study evaluated the feasibility, functional relevance and maintenance of a novel connectivity-informed real-time fMRI neurofeedback training. METHODS: In a randomized crossover sham-controlled design, 26 healthy subjects with high anxiety underwent real-time fMRI-guided neurofeedback training to enhance connectivity between the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and the amygdala (target pathway) during threat exposure. Maintenance of regulatory control was assessed after 3 days and in the absence of feedback. Training-induced changes in functional connectivity of the target pathway and anxiety ratings served as primary outcomes. RESULTS: Training of the target, yet not the sham control, pathway significantly increased amygdala-vlPFC connectivity and decreased levels of anxiety. Stronger connectivity increases were significantly associated with higher anxiety reduction on the group level. At the follow-up, volitional control over the target pathway was maintained in the absence of feedback. CONCLUSIONS: The present results demonstrate for the first time that successful self-regulation of amygdala-prefrontal top-down regulatory circuits may represent a novel intervention to control anxiety. As such, the present findings underscore both the critical contribution of amygdala-prefrontal circuits to emotion regulation and the therapeutic potential of connectivity-informed real-time neurofeedback.
26226604<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Emotional Valence, Arousal, and Threat Ratings of 160 Chinese Words among Adolescents.<<>>This study was conducted to provide ratings of valence/pleasantness, arousal/excitement, and threat/potential harm for 160 Chinese words. The emotional valence classification (positive, negative, or neutral) of all of the words corresponded to that of the equivalent English language words. More than 90% of the participants, junior high school students aged between 12 and 17 years, understood the words. The participants were from both mainland China and Hong Kong, thus the words can be applied to adolescents familiar with either simplified (e.g. in mainland China) or traditional Chinese (e.g. in Hong Kong) with a junior secondary school education or higher. We also established eight words with negative valence, high threat, and high arousal ratings to facilitate future research, especially on attentional and memory biases among individuals prone to anxiety. Thus, the new emotional word list provides a useful source of information for affective research in the Chinese language.
19853712<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>[Specific trait and state anxiety's roles in emergence and maintenance of attentional biases associated with anxiety: Inventories and investigation tracks].<<>>BACKGROUND: During these two last decades, much research has shown that anxiety can be characterised by an attentional bias favouring threat stimuli processing. This bias plays a central role in the development and maintenance of pathological states associated with anxiety. The first part of this article concerns numerous variables that elucidate parts of the appearance and maintenance conditions of attentional bias associated with anxiety. Thus, clinical versus non-clinical states of individuals play an important role in attentional behaviour of anxiety: at an early stage of information processing, which involves mainly automatic processes, the attentional bias appears whatever the status of anxious individuals. At a later stage, which involves controlled processes, non-clinical anxious subjects would be able to use defensive strategies, which allow them to counterbalance the bias that appeared before, while clinical anxious subjects would not be able to ignore this threat, because of the major rooting of their anxiety. A vigilance attentional bias would be shown in clinical individuals throughout a continuum of information processing. In addition, a near unanimous observation highlights the importance of the material specificity in obtaining attentional bias. However, this observation appears less obvious for the subliminal condition in which anxious individuals can perfect a surface analysis of the material, identifying the emotional valence of a word and not its specificity. Literature findings on anxiety impact in order to release more clarity and in an attempt to explain empirical results that sometimes remain contradictory; the second part of this article is particularly focused on another research track, rarely used but very promising: it concerns differentiating the specific roles of anxiety state and anxiety trait in the attentional patterns. The anxiety trait is defined as "an acquired behavioural disposition, which predisposes an individual to perceive a whole of circumstances objectively and not as dangerous or threatening". On the other hand, anxiety state reflects variable component and is defined as an emotive state "characterized by subjective and conscious feelings of apprehension and tension associated with an activation of the autonomous nervous system". For a long time, researchers have mainly focused on this first variable while occulting the second. However, various theoretical models underline that the anxiety trait variable alone is certainly a condition necessary but insufficient in the appearance and maintenance of attentional bias. Thus, some empirical research, highlighting the potential role of the anxiety state was born. Although they have, for the moment, a limited range due to the heterogeneity of their results, these studies open a new route of considerable research. Thus, on the preattentive level, the dominant role of the interaction between anxiety state and anxiety trait in the release of bias was highlighted in a near consensual way. It is not the same at a later stage of information processing, which is a stage where two tracks of results are confronted: a part of research suggests that maintenance of bias is due to, as at the preattentive level, an interactive effect of state and trait anxieties, whereas other research shows a central role of anxiety state in maintenance of attentional bias. Recent studies using different paradigms confirm the idea of a central role of anxiety state. Further research, separating the specific roles of state and trait anxiety, will be necessary to decide clearly. DISCUSSION: Various explanatory tracks were suggested to try to clear up these data. Thus, it's possible that the time-course of the stressor may be an important variable. In addition, the review highlights that state anxiety averages are too often far from the norms established by Spielberger et al. In short, if the state anxiety level is not sufficiently high in a number of searches, it then appears difficult to highlight the attentional biases, which are associated with it. Among them, the resort to a methodology combining physiological measurements (salivary index, ocular movements recording...) and cognitive measurements (questionnaires, dot probe paradigm, Stroop task...) seems to warrant a better understanding of attentional processes.
30953446<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Social anxiety is associated with BNST response to unpredictability.<<>>BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and cause substantial suffering and impairment. Whereas the amygdala has well-established contributions to anxiety, evidence from rodent and nonhuman primate models suggests that the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) may play a critical, and possibly distinct, role in human anxiety disorders. The BNST mediates hypervigilance and anticipatory anxiety in response to an unpredictable or ambiguous threat, core symptoms of social anxiety, yet little is known about the BNST's role in social anxiety. METHODS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure neural responses during a cued anticipation task with an unpredictable, predictable threat, and predictable neutral cues followed by threat or neutral images. Social anxiety was examined using a dimensional approach (N = 44 adults). RESULTS: For unpredictable cues, higher social anxiety was associated with lower BNST-amygdala connectivity. For unpredictable images, higher social anxiety was associated with greater connectivity between the BNST and both the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex and lower connectivity between the BNST and postcentral gyrus. Social anxiety moderated the BNST-amygdala dissociation for unpredictable images; higher social anxiety was associated with BNST > amygdala response to unpredictable threat relative to unpredictable neutral images. CONCLUSIONS: Social anxiety was associated with alterations in BNST responses to unpredictability, particularly in the BNST's interactions with other brain regions, including the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. To our knowledge, these findings provide the first evidence for the BNST's role in social anxiety, which may be a potential new target for prevention and intervention.
30618968<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Anticipation of Uncertain Threat Modulates Subsequent Affective Responses and Covariation Bias.<<>>Uncertainty contributes to stress and anxiety-like behaviors by impairing the ability of participants to objectively estimate threat. Our study used the cue-picture paradigm in conjunction with the event-related potential (ERP) technique to explore the temporal dynamics of anticipation for and response to uncertain threat in healthy individuals. This task used two types of cue. While 'certain' cues precisely forecasted the valence of the subsequent pictures (negative or neutral), the valence of pictures following 'uncertain' cues was not predictable. ERP data showed that, during anticipation, uncertain cues elicited similar Stimulus-Preceding Negativity (SPN) to certain-negative cues, while both of them elicited larger SPN than certain-neutral cues. During affective processing, uncertainty enlarged the mean amplitude of late positive potential (LPP) for both negative and neutral pictures. Behavioral data showed that participants reported more negative mood ratings of uncertain-neutral pictures relative to certain-neutral pictures and overestimated the probability of negative pictures following uncertain cues. Importantly, the enlarged anticipatory activity evoked by uncertain cues relative to that evoked by certain-neutral cues positively modulated the more negative mood ratings of uncertain-neutral pictures relative to certain-neutral pictures. Further, this more negative mood ratings and the general arousal anticipation during anticipatory stage contributed to the covariation bias. These results can provide a novel insight into understanding the neural mechanism and pathological basis of anxiety.
15869362<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Attentional biases to internal and external sources of potential threat in social anxiety.<<>>D. M. Clark and A. Wells (1995) proposed that a shift of attention inward toward interoceptive information is a central feature of social phobia. However, few studies have examined attentional biases toward internal physiological cues in social phobia. The current experiment assessed whether socially anxious individuals exhibit an attentional bias (a) toward cues for an internal source of potential threat (heart-rate information), (b) toward cues for an external source of potential threat (threatening faces) or (c) both. Ninety-one participants who were selected to form extreme groups based on a social anxiety screening measure performed a dot-probe task to assess location of attention. Results showed that socially anxious participants exhibited an attentional bias toward cues of internal, but not external, sources of potential threat.
30408271<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>A neuromarker of clinical outcome in attention bias modification therapy for social anxiety disorder.<<>>BACKGROUND: Attention bias modification (ABM) therapy aims to modify threat-related attention patterns via computerized tasks. Despite showing medium clinical effect sizes for anxiety disorders, underlying neural-cognitive mechanisms of change remain unclear. We used visual mismatch negativity (vMMN), an event-related potential sensitive to violations of learned statistical contingencies, to assess therapy-related contingency extraction processes in healthy participants and in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD). We then assessed whether vMMN amplitude predicts ABM treatment outcome. METHODS: A modified version of the dot-probe task was used to elicit vMMN, in which 80% of trials were standard and 20% were deviant. In study 1, 30 healthy adults were randomly assigned to one of two ABM conditions: one in which threat-congruent targets were deviant trials and threat-incongruent targets were standard trials, and another in which the contingency was reversed. Electroencephalography (EEG) was continuously measured and vMMN analyzed. In study 2, 38 patients with SAD underwent six sessions of ABM therapy. We tested whether rule extraction in the ABM task, indicated by vMMN amplitude, predicts treatment outcome. RESULTS: vMMN clearly emerged over prespecified scalp locations indicating contingency extraction during ABM (study 1). vMMN amplitude predicted clinical improvement after ABM therapy, uniquely accounting for 7% and 14.4% of the variance in clinician-rated and self-reported posttreatment SAD symptoms, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: vMMN emerges as a neural marker for contingency learning in ABM, suggesting a significant role for contingency extraction processes in the clinical efficacy of this therapy.
25961638<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Functional Connectivity under Anticipation of Shock: Correlates of Trait Anxious Affect versus Induced Anxiety.<<>>Sustained anxiety about potential future negative events is an important feature of anxiety disorders. In this study, we used a novel anticipation of shock paradigm to investigate individual differences in functional connectivity during prolonged threat of shock. We examined the correlates of between-participant differences in trait anxious affect and induced anxiety, where the latter reflects changes in self-reported anxiety resulting from the shock manipulation. Dissociable effects of trait anxious affect and induced anxiety were observed. Participants with high scores on a latent dimension of anxious affect showed less increase in ventromedial pFC-amygdala connectivity between periods of safety and shock anticipation. Meanwhile, lower levels of induced anxiety were linked to greater augmentation of dorsolateral pFC-anterior insula connectivity during shock anticipation. These findings suggest that ventromedial pFC-amygdala and dorsolateral pFC-insula networks might both contribute to regulation of sustained fear responses, with their recruitment varying independently across participants. The former might reflect an evolutionarily old mechanism for reducing fear or anxiety, whereas the latter might reflect a complementary mechanism by which cognitive control can be implemented to diminish fear responses generated due to anticipation of aversive stimuli or events. These two circuits might provide complementary, alternate targets for exploration in future pharmacological and cognitive intervention studies.
20727909<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Threat detection: behavioral practices in animals and humans.<<>>In contrast to a perceptible threat that releases freezing, fleeing and fighting, abstract potential threat elicits anxiety and vigilance. The prevalent view is that the larger the animal groups the lower the individual vigilance. Vigilance is a reflection of anxiety, and here we show that anxiety is contagious in grouped social animals. In humans, anxiety frequently results in rituals that confer a sense of controllability and thereby a means to cope with anxiety. Accordingly, in mental disorders with sustained anxiety, rituals predominate the behavior and consequently reduce functionality. Finally, the adaptive value of precautionary behavior, including rituals, lies in providing individuals with the opportunity to practice defensive means safely, and thus to prepare for the eventuality of real danger. Accordingly, the prevalence of anxiety in human and animal behavior accords with the "better safe than sorry" principle.
29867370<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Stimulation of the Nigrotectal Pathway at the Level of the Superior Colliculus Reduces Threat Recognition and Causes a Shift From Avoidance to Approach Behavior.<<>>Defensive behavioral responses are essential for survival in threating situations. The superior colliculus (SC) has been implicated in the generation of defensive behaviors elicited by visual, tactile and auditory stimuli. Furthermore, substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) neurons are known to exert a modulatory effect on midbrain tectum neural substrates. However, the functional role of this nigrotectal pathway in threating situations is still poorly understood. Using optogenetics in freely behaving mice, we activated SNr projections at the level of the SC, and assessed consequences on behavioral performance in an open field test (OFT) and the beetle mania task (BMT). The latter confronts a mouse with an erratic moving robo-beetle and allows to measure active and passive defensive responses upon frequent encounter of the threatening object. Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-mediated activation of the inhibitory nigrotectal pathway did not affect anxiety-like and exploratory behavior in the OFT, but increased the number of contacts between robo-beetle and test mouse in the BMT. Depending on the size of the arena, active avoidance responses were reduced, whereas tolerance and close following of the robo-beetle were significantly increased. We conclude from the data that the nigrotectal pathway plays holds the potential to modulate innate fear by attenuating threat recognition and causing a shift from defensive to approach behavior.
30051155<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Efficacy of Attention Bias Training for Child Anxiety Disorders: A Randomized Controlled Trial.<<>>A growing evidence base supports attention bias modification (ABM) as a novel intervention for anxiety. However, research has been largely conducted with adults and analogue samples, leaving the impact of ABM for child anxiety be fully elucidated. Thus, we conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled trial testing ABM efficacy versus an attention control condition (CC) in 31 children diagnosed with anxiety disorder. Youth were assigned to 4 weeks of ABM where attention was trained away from threat, or a sham CC in which no bias training occurred. Findings indicate that significantly more youth in the ABM versus CC group were considered treatment responders post training. The ABM versus CC group also demonstrated a greater decrease in anxiety severity, with this difference being marginally significant. Findings lend support for the potential of ABM in reducing youth anxiety. Further work regarding mechanisms of action is warranted to advance ABM research.
26678871<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Phasic and sustained brain responses in the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis during threat anticipation.<<>>Several lines of evidence suggest that the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) are differentially involved in phasic and sustained fear. Even though, results from neuroimaging studies support this distinction, a specific effect of a temporal dissociation with phasic responses to onset versus sustained responses during prolonged states of threat anticipation has not been shown yet. To explore this issue, we investigated brain activation during anticipation of threat in 38 healthy participants by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants were presented different visual cues indicated the temporally unpredictable occurrence of a subsequent aversive or neutral stimulus. During the onset of aversive versus neutral anticipatory cues, results showed a differential phasic activation of amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). In contrast, activation in the BNST and other brain regions, including insula, dorsolateral PFC, ACC, cuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, and periaqueductal grey was characterized by a sustained response during the threat versus neutral anticipation period. Analyses of functional connectivity showed phasic amygdala response as positively associated with activation, mainly in sensory cortex areas whereas sustained BNST activation was negatively associated with activation in visual cortex and positively correlated with activation in the insula and thalamus. These findings suggest that the amygdala is responsive to the onset of cues signaling the unpredictable occurrence of a potential threat while the BNST in concert with other areas is involved in sustained anxiety. Furthermore, the amygdala and BNST are characterized by distinctive connectivity patterns during threat anticipation.
23783199<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Uncertainty and anticipation in anxiety: an integrated neurobiological and psychological perspective.<<>>Uncertainty about a possible future threat disrupts our ability to avoid it or to mitigate its negative impact and thus results in anxiety. Here, we focus the broad literature on the neurobiology of anxiety through the lens of uncertainty. We identify five processes that are essential for adaptive anticipatory responses to future threat uncertainty and propose that alterations in the neural instantiation of these processes result in maladaptive responses to uncertainty in pathological anxiety. This framework has the potential to advance the classification, diagnosis and treatment of clinical anxiety.
30289497<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Impact of induced anxiety on neural responses to monetary incentives.<<>>Previous research demonstrates that aversive stimuli can interrupt appetitive processing and that brain regions involved with the processing of potential rewards, such as the ventral striatum (VS), also respond to threatening information. Potential losses can likewise activate the VS and, thus, the full extent to which threat can impact neural responses during incentive processing remains unclear. Here, unpredictable threat of shock was used to induce anxiety while participants performed the monetary incentive delay (MID) task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During anticipation, anxiety impacted neural responses within the bilateral VS and distributed regions of the occipital cortex. Anxiety enhanced activity within the VS to both gain and loss trials. Furthermore, anxiety enhanced activity to both gain and loss trials within dorsal areas of BA19. However, anxiety only enhanced activity during gain, but not loss trials, within ventral areas of BA19. These results suggest that during anticipation, induced anxiety enhanced VS activity to incentives generally, which might reflect changes in the subjective salience of gains and losses. Collectively, these results suggest that the impact of induced anxiety on responses to monetary incentives depend on the neural region, type of incentive, and stage of processing.
21487723<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Core cognitions related to health anxiety in self-reported medical and non-medical samples.<<>>The cognitive-behavioural model of health anxiety hypothesizes that the degree of health threat experienced by an individual is a function of the perceived: (1) likelihood of illness; (2) awfulness of illness; (3) difficulty coping with illness; and (4) inadequacy of medical services. While research has examined cognitions in health anxiety, it is not known whether these cognitions predict health anxiety in individuals who do or do not report medical conditions and whether these cognitions are uniquely related to health anxiety. After developing the Health Cognitions Questionnaire to assess these specific cognitions, we examined the extent to which the cognitions predicted health anxiety and poor response to reassurance in a healthy community sample (n = 273) and a sample who self-reported various medical conditions (n = 208). Supporting the cognitive-behavioural model, these cognitions predicted health anxiety and poor response to reassurance in both samples, with some differences observed between those who did or did not report medical conditions. The cognitions were uniquely related to health anxiety even after controlling for depression and general anxiety. Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed. Overall, the Health Cognitions Questionnaire has potential to facilitate further research on the development, maintenance, and treatment of health anxiety.
16110279<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Anxiety and attentional bias for threat: an event-related potential study.<<>>We investigated the attentional bias for threat in selected high and low trait-anxious participants using an event-related potential technique. A modified cue-target paradigm was adopted with threatening and nonthreatening pictures as uninformative location cues. In high anxious individuals, reactions were speeded up and the occipitoparietal P1 amplitude was enhanced when targets appeared at the same location as threatening pictures relative to nonthreatening ones, whereas in low anxious individuals, the P1 amplitude tended to be enhanced when the targets appeared at the opposite location to threatening pictures. These results suggest that the attentional bias caused by peripheral threatening stimuli is able to modulate the visual inputs in early processing stages, and this mechanism is markedly influenced by an individual's anxiety level.
20811944<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Is there room for 'development' in developmental models of information processing biases to threat in children and adolescents?<<>>Clinical and experimental theories assume that processing biases in attention and interpretation are a causal mechanism through which anxiety develops. Despite growing evidence that these processing biases are present in children and, therefore, develop long before adulthood, these theories ignore the potential role of child development. This review attempts to place information processing biases within a theoretical developmental framework. We consider whether child development has no impact on information processing biases to threat (integral bias model), or whether child development influences information processing biases and if so whether it does so by moderating the expression of an existing bias (moderation model) or by affecting the acquisition of a bias (acquisition model). We examine the extent to which these models fit with existing theory and research evidence and outline some methodological issues that need to be considered when drawing conclusions about the potential role of child development in the information processing of threat stimuli. Finally, we speculate about the developmental processes that might be important to consider in future research.
26206076<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Threat-Related Attention Bias Variability and Posttraumatic Stress.<<>>OBJECTIVE: Threat monitoring facilitates survival by allowing one to efficiently and accurately detect potential threats. Traumatic events can disrupt healthy threat monitoring, inducing biased and unstable threat-related attention deployment. Recent research suggests that greater attention bias variability, that is, attention fluctuations alternating toward and away from threat, occurs in participants with PTSD relative to healthy comparison subjects who were either exposed or not exposed to traumatic events. The current study extends findings on attention bias variability in PTSD. METHOD: Previous measurement of attention bias variability was refined by employing a moving average technique. Analyses were conducted across seven independent data sets; in each, data on attention bias variability were collected by using variants of the dot-probe task. Trauma-related and anxiety symptoms were evaluated across samples by using structured psychiatric interviews and widely used self-report questionnaires, as specified for each sample. RESULTS: Analyses revealed consistent evidence of greater attention bias variability in patients with PTSD following various types of traumatic events than in healthy participants, participants with social anxiety disorder, and participants with acute stress disorder. Moreover, threat-related, and not positive, attention bias variability was correlated with PTSD severity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings carry possibilities for using attention bias variability as a specific cognitive marker of PTSD and for tailoring protocols for attention bias modification for this disorder.
18752726<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Short-term serotonergic but not noradrenergic antidepressant administration reduces attentional vigilance to threat in healthy volunteers.<<>>Anxiety is associated with threat-related biases in information processing such as heightened attentional vigilance to potential threat. Such biases are an important focus of psychological treatments for anxiety disorders. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective in the treatment of a range of anxiety disorders. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of an SSRI on the processing of threat in healthy volunteers. A selective noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), which is not generally used in the treatment of anxiety, was used as a contrast to assess the specificity of SSRI effects on threat processing. Forty-two healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to 7 d double-blind intervention with the SSRI citalopram (20 mg/d), the SNRI reboxetine (8 mg/d), or placebo. On the final day, attentional and interpretative bias to threat was assessed using the attentional probe and the homograph primed lexical decision tasks. Citalopram reduced attentional vigilance towards fearful faces but did not affect the interpretation of ambiguous homographs as threatening. Reboxetine had no significant effect on either of these measures. Citalopram reduces attentional orienting to threatening stimuli, which is potentially relevant to its clinical use in the treatment of anxiety disorders. This finding supports a growing literature suggesting that an important mechanism through which pharmacological agents may exert their effects on mood is by reversing the cognitive biases that characterize the disorders that they treat. Future studies are needed to clarify the neural mechanisms through which these effects on threat processing are mediated.
22512994<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Threat or boost? Social comparison affects older people's performance differently depending on task domain.<<>>OBJECTIVES: In this research, we investigate whether social comparison with younger people can result in either a stereotype-based threat or boost in older people's performance. METHODS: Study 1 used nationally representative data to establish domains of performance in which older people are either stereotypically disadvantaged or advantaged relative to younger people. Study 2 was an experiment to test how a potentially threatening versus control versus enhancing comparison with younger people would affect performance in negatively and positively stereotyped task domains. RESULTS: As predicted, compared with the control condition, stereotype threat caused performance decrements in both task domains. This effect was partially mediated by anxiety. Moreover, the enhancing social comparison boosted performance, but only on a crossword task, a task on which older people's abilities are favorably stereotyped. DISCUSSION: The research demonstrates that a threatening comparison can result in underperformance by older people both in negatively and positively self-stereotyped task domains. It also demonstrates that social comparison with younger people can enhance older people's performance in a positively stereotyped task domain. The implications for creating circumstances likely to enable older people to achieve their full potential are discussed.
15865920<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Brief cognitive-behavioral phone-based intervention targeting anxiety about the threat of attack: a pilot study.<<>>A brief, cognitive-behavioral, phone-based intervention was employed with an Israeli sample experiencing anticipatory anxiety about potential war-related attacks. In this quasi-experimental controlled pilot study, the cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention (diaphragmatic breathing and a modified cognitive-restructuring technique) was compared with the standard hotline care administered when worried citizens called a mental health emergency hotline in Israel. Individuals (n=32) were administered anxiety and worry measures pre-intervention, post-intervention, and three days post-intervention. The results indicated that anxiety levels decreased for the experimental and control group immediately post-intervention; however, three days later, the levels of anxiety in the CBT group continued to decline, while anxiety levels in the control group reached pre-intervention levels on two of the three outcome measures. These results suggest that CBT can be effectively delivered by paraprofessionals over the phone, which is cost-effective and efficient. Limitations are considered, and implications for treating individuals coping with the threat of terrorism are discussed.
27797550<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>The cognitive architecture of anxiety-like behavioral inhibition.<<>>The combination of reward and potential threat is termed approach/avoidance conflict and elicits specific behaviors, including passive avoidance and behavioral inhibition (BI). Anxiety-relieving drugs reduce these behaviors, and a rich psychological literature has addressed how personality traits dominated by BI predispose for anxiety disorders. Yet, a formal understanding of the cognitive inference and planning processes underlying anxiety-like BI is lacking. Here, we present and empirically test such formalization in the terminology of reinforcement learning. We capitalize on a human computer game in which participants collect sequentially appearing monetary tokens while under threat of virtual "predation." First, we demonstrate that humans modulate BI according to experienced consequences. This suggests an instrumental implementation of BI generation rather than a Pavlovian mechanism that is agnostic about action outcomes. Second, an internal model that would make BI adaptive is expressed in an independent task that involves no threat. The existence of such internal model is a necessary condition to conclude that BI is under model-based control. These findings relate a plethora of human and nonhuman observations on BI to reinforcement learning theory, and crucially constrain the quest for its neural implementation. (PsycINFO Database Record
23620193<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Dwelling on potential threat cues: an eye movement marker for combat-related PTSD.<<>>BACKGROUND: Although several studies have documented an attentional bias toward threat in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the nature of this bias has not been clearly delineated. The present study utilized eye tracking technology to delineate the time course and components of attentional bias for threat cues in combat-related PTSD. METHODS: Veterans with PTSD (n = 21), combat-exposed veterans without PTSD (n = 16), and nonveteran controls (n = 21) viewed emotional expressions (fearful, disgusted, happy) paired with neutral expressions for 3 s presentations. RESULTS: Veterans with PTSD maintained attention longer on the fearful and disgusted expressions relative to the happy expression. This negativity bias was sustained over the course of the 3 s trials, and robustly distinguished veterans with PTSD from both veterans without PTSD and nonveteran controls. CONCLUSIONS: Dwelling on potential threat cues may reflect current PTSD symptoms, or it could reflect a cognitive vulnerability factor for PTSD.
19117552<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Do anxious parents interpretive biases towards threat extend into their child's environment?<<>>Anxiety disorders are known to run in families [Turner, S. M., Beidel, D. C., & Costello, A. (1987). Psychopathology in the offspring of anxiety disorder patients. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 55(2), 229-235] and environmental factors may largely account for the concordance between parental and child anxieties. Cognitive psychology models emphasise the importance of interpretive biases towards threat in the maintenance of anxiety and it is well established that anxious adults and children display similar interpretive biases and that these biases in anxious parents and their children are correlated. This raises the question of whether anxious cognitions/cognitive style may be transmitted from parent to child. We propose that this is more likely if anxious parents demonstrate interpretive biases not only about potential threats in their own environment but also about potential threats in their child's environment. Forty parents completed a recognition memory measure of interpretation bias adapted from Eysenck, Mogg, May, Richards, and Mathews (1991) [Bias in interpretation of ambiguous sentences related to threat in anxiety. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 100(2), 144-150] to measure biases in response to potentially threat provoking situations involving themselves and their child. The interpretive biases demonstrated by parents were similar across situations involving themselves and their children. As expected, parental interpretive biases were further modified by anxiety with higher levels of parental anxiety associated with more negative interpretive biases about situations in their own and their child's environment, although this association was significantly stronger for potentially threat provoking situations in their own environment. These results are consistent with parent's interpretive biases extending beyond their own environment into their child's environment, although future research should continue to consider the mechanisms by which anxious parents may transmit fear cognitions to their children.
23750133<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Prefrontal inhibition of threat processing reduces working memory interference.<<>>Bottom-up processes can interrupt ongoing cognitive processing in order to adaptively respond to emotional stimuli of high potential significance, such as those that threaten wellbeing. However it is vital that this interference can be modulated in certain contexts to focus on current tasks. Deficits in the ability to maintain the appropriate balance between cognitive and emotional demands can severely impact on day-to-day activities. This fMRI study examined this interaction between threat processing and cognition; 18 adult participants performed a visuospatial working memory (WM) task with two load conditions, in the presence and absence of anxiety induction by threat of electric shock. Threat of shock interfered with performance in the low cognitive load condition; however interference was eradicated under high load, consistent with engagement of emotion regulation mechanisms. Under low load the amygdala showed significant activation to threat of shock that was modulated by high cognitive load. A directed top-down control contrast identified two regions associated with top-down control; ventrolateral PFC and dorsal ACC. Dynamic causal modeling provided further evidence that under high cognitive load, top-down inhibition is exerted on the amygdala and its outputs to prefrontal regions. Additionally, we hypothesized that individual differences in a separate, non-emotional top-down control task would predict the recruitment of dorsal ACC and ventrolateral PFC during top-down control of threat. Consistent with this, performance on a separate dichotic listening task predicted dorsal ACC and ventrolateral PFC activation during high WM load under threat of shock, though activation in these regions did not directly correlate with WM performance. Together, the findings suggest that under high cognitive load and threat, top-down control is exerted by dACC and vlPFC to inhibit threat processing, thus enabling WM performance without threat-related interference.
20727910<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Adaptation to potential threat: the evolution, neurobiology, and psychopathology of the security motivation system.<<>>The risk of improbable, uncertain, but grave potential dangers poses unique adaptive challenges. We argue that to manage such risks, a special motivational system evolved, which we term the security motivation system. Review of work across a range of species indicates that this system is designed to detect subtle indicators of potential threat, to probe the environment for further information about these possible dangers, and to motivate engagement in precautionary behaviors, which also serves to terminate security motivation. We advance a neurobiological-circuit model of the security motivation system, which consists of a cascade of cortico-striato-pallido-thalamo-cortical loops with brainstem-mediated negative feedback. We also detail the broader physiological network involved, including regulation of the parasympathetic nervous system, with emphasis on vagal regulation of cardiac output, and activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. Finally, we propose that some kinds of psychopathology stem from dysfunction of the security motivation system. In particular, obsessive compulsive disorder may result from the failure of a mechanism by which engagement in precautionary behavior normally terminates activation of the system.
21928153<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Insomnia, worry, anxiety and depression as predictors of the occurrence and persistence of paranoid thinking.<<>>PURPOSE: Our theoretical model proposes that insomnia, worry, and negative affect are important determinants of paranoid thinking. Anxiety produces anticipation of threat, depression increases the sense of vulnerability, worry leads to implausible ideas, and insomnia exacerbates negative affect and creates an altered perceptual state. The study objective was to examine for the first time these factors as predictors of the onset of new paranoid thinking and of the persistence of existing paranoid thinking. METHOD: A total of 2,382 participants in the 2000 British National Psychiatric Morbidity Survey were followed-up 18 months after their first assessment. Baseline assessments were used to predict the development and persistence of paranoid thinking at follow-up. Data were weighted to be representative of the general household population. RESULTS: Insomnia, worry, anxiety, depression and depressive ideas were each substantial predictors both of new inceptions of paranoia and of the persistence of existing paranoid thinking. Worry and insomnia were the strongest predictors. For example, insomnia at the first assessment led to a more than threefold increase in later inceptions of paranoid thinking. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that insomnia, worry, anxiety and depression are potential risk factors for new inceptions of paranoid thinking. The results also corroborate an emerging literature indicating that anxiety, worry and depression may encourage the persistence of paranoid thinking. The study provides the first longitudinal evidence linking insomnia and paranoia. The important clinical implication is that the use of interventions for common mental health difficulties in people with psychosis may have the additional benefit of reducing paranoia.
26030449<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Stereotype threat and racial differences in citizens' experiences of police encounters.<<>>We conducted 2 studies to investigate how cultural stereotypes that depict Blacks as criminals affect the way Blacks experience encounters with police officers, expecting that such encounters induce Blacks to feel stereotype threat (i.e., concern about being judged and treated unfairly by police because of the stereotype). In Study 1, we asked Black and White participants to report how they feel when interacting with police officers in general. As predicted, Blacks, but not Whites, reported concern that police officers stereotype them as criminals simply because of their race. In addition, this effect was found for Black men but not Black women. In Study 2, we asked Black and White men to imagine a specific police encounter and assessed potential downstream consequences of stereotype threat. Consistent with Study 1, Black but not White men anticipated feeling stereotype threat in the hypothetical police encounter. Further, racial differences in anticipated threat translated into racial differences in anticipated anxiety, self-regulatory efforts, and behavior that is commonly perceived as suspicious by police officers. By demonstrating that Blacks might expect to be judged and treated unfairly by police because of the negative stereotype of Black criminality, this research extends stereotype threat theory to the new domain of criminal justice encounters. It also has practical implications for understanding how the stereotype could ironically contribute to bias-based policing and racial disparities in the justice system.
30375085<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Cognitive performance of youth with primary generalized anxiety disorder versus primary obsessive-compulsive disorder.<<>>BACKGROUND: Despite gains made in the study of childhood anxiety, differential diagnosis remains challenging because of indistinct boundaries between disorders and high comorbidity. This is certainly true for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) as they share multiple cognitive processes (e.g., rumination, intolerance of uncertainty, and increased attention to threat). Disentangling such cognitive characteristics and, subsequently, underlying mechanisms could serve to inform assessment and treatment practices, and improve prognoses. METHODS: The current study sought to compare the cognitive performance (working memory, visuospatial memory, planning ability/efficiency, and cognitive flexibility), indexed by the Cambridge Neuropsychological Automated Battery (CANTAB) among three nonoverlapping groups of youth: (1) those diagnosed with OCD (n = 28), (2) those diagnosed with GAD, not OCD (n = 34), and (3) typically-developing controls (TDC) (n = 65). RESULTS: Results showed that OCD and GAD youth demonstrated neurocognitive deficits in planning ability/efficiency, cognitive flexibility, and visual processing when compared to TDC, with potential diagnostic specificity such that youth with GAD or OCD had unique deficits compared to TDC and to one another. Specifically, youth with OCD demonstrated significantly impaired planning ability compared to youth in the GAD and TDS groups, whereas youth with GAD demonstrated greater cognitive inflexibility and delayed visual processing compared to youth in the OCD and TDC groups. CONCLUSIONS: Future studies should expand upon these findings with more comprehensive assessment of cognitive functioning by including self- and parent-report forms, and neuroimaging to link behavioral findings with subjective ratings and neurocircuitry. Altogether, data can then inform future assessment and treatment targets.
28950918<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Specific amygdala response to masked fearful faces in post-traumatic stress relative to other anxiety disorders.<<>>BACKGROUND: Altered amygdala activation to fear-related stimuli has been proposed to be a potential neural correlate of heightened threat sensitivity in anxiety- and stress-related disorders. However, the role of stimulus awareness and disorder specificity remains widely unclear. Here we investigated amygdala responses to conscious and unconscious fearful faces in patients suffering from panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and in a large sample of healthy controls (HC). METHODS: During event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging participants (n = 120; 20 PD, 20 GAD, 20 PTSD, 60 HC) were confronted with briefly presented fearful faces, neutral faces, and non-faces in a backward masking paradigm. The design allowed for the analysis of trial-by-trial face detection performance and amygdala responses to fearful v. neutral faces. RESULTS: All participants exhibited increased amygdala activation to fearful v. neutral faces during conscious trials. Specifically during unconscious face processing, the PTSD, compared with all other groups, showed higher right basolateral (BLA) amygdala activity to fearful v. neutral faces. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that BLA amygdala hyperactivity during unconscious, but not conscious, processing of fearful faces differentiates PTSD from the investigated disorders. This finding suggests an automatic and specific neural hyper-responsivity to general fear cues in PTSD and supports the idea of categorical differences between PTSD and other anxiety-related disorders.
28867938<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Environmental transmission of generalized anxiety disorder from parents to children: worries, experiential avoidance, and intolerance of uncertainty.<<>>Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) runs in families. Building on recent theoretical approaches, this review focuses on potential environmental pathways for parent-to-child transmission of GAD. First, we address child acquisition of a generalized pattern of fearful/anxious and avoidant responding to potential threat from parents via verbal information and via modeling. Next, we address how parenting behaviors may contribute to maintenance of fearful/anxious and avoidant reactions in children. Finally, we consider intergenerational transmission of worries as a way of coping with experiential avoidance of strong negative emotions and with intolerance of uncertainty. We conclude that parents with GAD may bias their children's processing of potential threats in the environment by conveying the message that the world is not safe, that uncertainty is intolerable, that strong emotions should be avoided, and that worry helps to cope with uncertainty, thereby transmitting cognitive styles that characterize GAD. Our review highlights the need for research on specific pathways for parent-to-child transmission of GAD.
26774515<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Social anxiety is related to increased dwell time on socially threatening faces.<<>>BACKGROUND: Identification of reliable targets for therapeutic interventions is essential for developing evidence-based therapies. Threat-related attention bias has been implicated in the etiology and maintenance of social anxiety disorder. Extant response-time-based threat bias measures have demonstrated limited reliability and internal consistency. Here, we examined gaze patterns of socially anxious and nonanxious participants in relation to social threatening and neutral stimuli using an eye-tracking task, comprised of multiple threat and neutral stimuli, presented for an extended time-period. We tested the psychometric properties of this task with the hope to provide a solid stepping-stone for future treatment development. METHODS: Eye gaze was tracked while participants freely viewed 60 different matrices comprised of eight disgusted and eight neutral facial expressions, presented for 6000ms each. Gaze patterns on threat and neutral areas of interest (AOIs) of participants with SAD, high socially anxious students and nonanxious students were compared. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were evaluated. RESULTS: Participants did not differ on first-fixation variables. However, overall, socially anxious students and participants with SAD dwelled significantly longer on threat faces compared with nonanxious participants, with no difference between the anxious groups. Groups did not differ in overall dwell time on neutral faces. Internal consistency of total dwell time on threat and neutral AOIs was high and one-week test-retest reliability was acceptable. LIMITATIONS: Only disgusted facial expressions were used. Relative small sample size. CONCLUSION: Social anxiety is associated with increased dwell time on socially threatening stimuli, presenting a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
20723575<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>The psychology of potential threat: properties of the security motivation system.<<>>Results of three experiments support hypothesized properties of the security motivation system, a special motivational system for handling potential threats, as proposed by Szechtman and Woody (2004). First, mild stimuli suggesting potential harm produced a marked state of activation (evident in both objective and subjective measures), consistent with the hypothesis that the security motivation system is finely tuned for the detection of potential threat. Second, in the absence of corrective behavior, this evoked activation is persistent, supporting the hypothesis that once stimulated, the security motivation system produces an enduring motivational state involving the urge to engage in threat-reducing behavior. Third, engagement in corrective behavior was effective in returning activation levels to baseline, whereas cognitive reappraisal was not. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that deactivation of the security motivation system depends on performance of security-related behaviors, rather than non-behavioral events such as cognitive re-evaluation of threat.
28268256<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Cannabidiol regulation of emotion and emotional memory processing: relevance for treating anxiety-related and substance abuse disorders.<<>>Learning to associate cues or contexts with potential threats or rewards is adaptive and enhances survival. Both aversive and appetitive memories are therefore powerful drivers of behaviour, but the inappropriate expression of conditioned responding to fear- and drug-related stimuli can develop into anxiety-related and substance abuse disorders respectively. These disorders are associated with abnormally persistent emotional memories and inadequate treatment, often leading to symptom relapse. Studies show that cannabidiol, the main non-psychotomimetic phytocannabinoid found in Cannabis sativa, reduces anxiety via 5-HT1A and (indirect) cannabinoid receptor activation in paradigms assessing innate responses to threat. There is also accumulating evidence from animal studies investigating the effects of cannabidiol on fear memory processing indicating that it reduces learned fear in paradigms that are translationally relevant to phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder. Cannabidiol does so by reducing fear expression acutely and by disrupting fear memory reconsolidation and enhancing fear extinction, both of which can result in a lasting reduction of learned fear. Recent studies have also begun to elucidate the effects of cannabidiol on drug memory expression using paradigms with translational relevance to addiction. The findings suggest that cannabidiol reduces the expression of drug memories acutely and by disrupting their reconsolidation. Here, we review the literature demonstrating the anxiolytic effects of cannabidiol before focusing on studies investigating its effects on various fear and drug memory processes. Understanding how cannabidiol regulates emotion and emotional memory processing may eventually lead to its use as a treatment for anxiety-related and substance abuse disorders.

11801300<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Human defensive behaviors to threat scenarios show parallels to fear- and anxiety-related defense patterns of non-human mammals.<<>>Defense patterns of rats and mice have been characterized in terms of the relationships between the type of defensive behavior (e.g. flight, freezing, hiding, defensive threat/attack, and risk assessment) and particular features of the eliciting (threat) stimulus and the situation in which it is encountered. Because the defense systems of rodents serve as major models for investigating and understanding both the physiology and the behavioral expression of emotional response to aversive stimuli, it is essential to evaluate whether these systems show strong parallels in human responsivity to threat. One hundred and sixty male and female undergraduate students read a set of 12 scenarios involving a present or potential threatening conspecific, and chose a primary defensive response to each. These scenarios were designed to vary features known to influence defensive responding in rodents: magnitude of threat; escapability of the situation; ambiguity of the threat stimulus; distance between the threat and the subject; presence of a hiding place. Male and female responses to the various scenarios were highly correlated, except for yell, scream, or call for help which was frequent for females, rare for males. However, a combination of this response category with 'attack' showed a highly positive (+0.96) male-female correlation, across scenarios.Correlations between manipulated (and rated) features of the threat stimulus and situation, and type of defensive behavior chosen, strongly supported a view that the patterning of defensive behavior is similar for humans and non-human mammals. Significant correlations were obtained relevant to eight specific hypotheses derived from the animal literature, with some support for two additional hypotheses (non-significant correlations averaging 0.4 or more in expected direction). While three predicted correlations were not supported in these findings, only a single significant correlation was obtained that had not been predicted on the basis of the animal literature. Although the scenario approach, and this application, have specific limitations, these results provide substantial suggestion of congruence between human and non-human mammal defense systems.
24995682<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Altered activation of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex in the context of emotional face distractors in children and adolescents with anxiety disorders.<<>>BACKGROUND: Pediatric and adult anxiety disorder patients exhibit attention bias to threat and difficulty disengaging attention away from threat. Cognitive frameworks suggest that these patterns are associated with hyperactivation of regions associated with detecting threat, such as the amygdala, and hypoactivation of regions associated with regulating attention, including the lateral prefrontal cortex and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC). The aim of the present study was to examine the neural correlates of these processes in children and adolescents with anxiety disorders. METHODS: Participants with an anxiety disorder 7 to 19 years old (n = 34) and typically developing controls (n = 35) underwent fMRI scanning. During scanning, they completed a task with conditions that manipulated whether participants were instructed to match emotional faces (direct emotion processing) or match shapes in the context of emotional face distractors (attentional control). RESULTS: Results revealed a significant difference in rACC activation during shape versus face matching, with controls evidencing greater rACC activation relative to patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies abnormalities in rACC activation as a potential neural mediator associated with pediatric anxiety disorders, which can inform frameworks for understanding their development and treatment.
24103196<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>How do people with persecutory delusions evaluate threat in a controlled social environment? A qualitative study using virtual reality.<<>>BACKGROUND: Environmental factors have been associated with psychosis but there is little qualitative research looking at how the ongoing interaction between individual and environment maintains psychotic symptoms. AIMS: The current study investigates how people with persecutory delusions interpret events in a virtual neutral social environment using qualitative methodology. METHOD: 20 participants with persecutory delusions and 20 controls entered a virtual underground train containing neutral characters. Under these circumstances, people with persecutory delusions reported similar levels of paranoia as non-clinical participants. The transcripts of a post-virtual reality interview of the first 10 participants in each group were analysed. RESULTS: Thematic analyses of interviews focusing on the decision making process associated with attributing intentions of computer-generated characters revealed 11 themes grouped in 3 main categories (evidence in favour of paranoid appraisals, evidence against paranoid appraisals, other behaviour). CONCLUSIONS: People with current persecutory delusions are able to use a range of similar strategies to healthy volunteers when making judgements about potential threat in a neutral environment that does not elicit anxiety, but they are less likely than controls to engage in active hypothesis-testing and instead favour experiencing "affect" as evidence of persecutory intention.
26284366<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Motivational Modulation of Self-Initiated and Externally Triggered Movement Speed Induced by Threat of Shock: Experimental Evidence for Paradoxical Kinesis in Parkinson's Disease.<<>>BACKGROUND: Paradoxical kinesis has been observed in bradykinetic people with Parkinson's disease. Paradoxical kinesis occurs in situations where an individual is strongly motivated or influenced by relevant external cues. Our aim was to induce paradoxical kinesis in the laboratory. We tested whether the motivation of avoiding a mild electric shock was sufficient to induce paradoxical kinesis in externally-triggered and self-initiated conditions in people with Parkinson's disease tested on medication and in age-matched controls. METHODS: Participants completed a shock avoidance behavioural paradigm in which half of the trials could result in a mild electric shock if the participant did not move fast enough. Half of the trials of each type were self-initiated and half were externally-triggered. The criterion for avoiding shock was a maximum movement time, adjusted according to each participant's performance on previous trials using a staircase tracking procedure. RESULTS: On trials with threat of shock, both patients with Parkinson's disease and controls had faster movement times compared to no potential shock trials, in both self-initiated and externally-triggered conditions. The magnitude of improvement of movement time from no potential shock to potential shock trials was positively correlated with anxiety ratings. CONCLUSIONS: When motivated to avoid mild electric shock, patients with Parkinson's disease, similar to healthy controls, showed significant speeding of movement execution. This was observed in both self-initiated and externally-triggered versions of the task. Nevertheless, in the ET condition the improvement of reaction times induced by motivation to avoid shocks was greater for the PD patients than controls, highlighting the value of external cues for movement initiation in PD patients. The magnitude of improvement from the no potential shock to the potential shock trials was associated with the threat-induced anxiety. This demonstration of paradoxical kinesis in the laboratory under both self-initiated and externally-triggered conditions has implications for motivational and attentional enhancement of movement speed in Parkinson's disease.
25503890<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>The use of Spielberger's State-Trait Personality Inventory (trait anxiety subscale) with naval subaquatic specialists.<<>>OBJECTIVES: Panic behavior poses a particular threat to the health and safety of subaquatic occupational specialists. Trait anxiety has previously been identified as a marker of panic behavior under water, and Spielberger's State-Trait Personality Inventory (trait anxiety subscale) has been previously used to measure trait anxiety among subaquatic specialists. Using archived data, the trait anxiety scores of subaquatic specialists were analyzed to meet 3 objectives: 1stly - to develop a trait anxiety profile of subaquatic specialists; 2ndly - to investigate the predictive value of trait anxiety measures upon entering an occupational field; and 3rdly - to establish the reliability of these scores over time. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Archival trait-anxiety data from 322 subjects were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: Analysis of the available scores revealed a highly homogenous as well as a very low trait anxiety profile for the investigated occupational group. Additionally, low trait anxiety was somewhat associated with success during specialist training: fewer candidates with high trait anxiety scores completed their qualification. Moreover, measurement of trait anxiety was stable over time, which suggests that when scores for this occupational group are screened, deviations from previous scores could signify a potential need for referral to an intervention from health professionals. CONCLUSIONS: Using the trait anxiety subscale as part of occupational health surveillance of subaquatic specialists could support prevention of accidents by identifying high-risk candidates during their annual health assessments, and referral for timeous intervention.
30573408<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Specificity of resting-state heart rate variability in psychosis: A comparison with clinical high risk, anxiety, and healthy controls.<<>>Maladaptability, particularly of autonomic activity, is described as a central component of vulnerability-stress-models for the pathogenesis of psychotic symptoms. Investigating heart rate variability (HRV) as an index of autonomic adaptability is thus likely to improve our understanding of psychosis. In clinically vulnerable groups for psychosis, it is unclear whether maladaptability is already evident. Moreover, to investigate specificity, direct comparisons to other mental disorders are required. In the present study, we analyzed 3min of resting-state heart rate, HRV, and negative affect in 130 participants; consisting of participants with psychotic disorders (PSY; n=44), clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR; n=22), anxiety disorders (anxiety controls, AC; n=29) and healthy controls (HC; n=35). ANCOVAs controlling for age revealed significant group differences for both investigated vagal HRV parameters, which were reduced in PSY compared to HC. The high-frequency domain HRV in PSY was also lower than in CHR and - in a non-significant trend - than in AC. Also, ANOVAs for heart rate and negative affect revealed significant increases in PSY compared to HC. Exploratory analyses of medication effects showed moderate dosage associations with heart rate and high-frequency HRV. Thus, in the present study, the activity of the autonomic nervous system was altered in psychosis but not in an at-risk group. A potential specificity of the effect can be speculated in contrast to anxiety disorders. Future studies should investigate the predictive value of HRV for increased stress-sensitivity or transition to clinical symptoms as well as the implications for daily threat perception and symptom maintenance.
26105138<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>The Human BNST: Functional Role in Anxiety and Addiction.<<>>The consequences of chronic stress on brain structure and function are far reaching. Whereas stress can produce short-term adaptive changes in the brain, chronic stress leads to long-term maladaptive changes that increase vulnerability to psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and addiction. These two disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in the United States, and are typically chronic, disabling, and highly comorbid. Emerging evidence implicates a tiny brain region-the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST)-in the body's stress response and in anxiety and addiction. Rodent studies provide compelling evidence that the BNST plays a central role in sustained threat monitoring, a form of adaptive anxiety, and in the withdrawal and relapse stages of addiction; however, little is known about the role of BNST in humans. Here, we review current evidence for BNST function in humans, including evidence for a role in the production of both adaptive and maladaptive anxiety. We also review preliminary evidence of the role of BNST in addiction in humans. Together, these studies provide a foundation of knowledge about the role of BNST in adaptive anxiety and stress-related disorders. Although the field is in its infancy, future investigations of human BNST function have tremendous potential to illuminate mechanisms underlying stress-related disorders and identify novel neural targets for treatment.
29258631<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Attention bias modification augments cognitive-behavioral group therapy for social anxiety disorder: a randomized controlled trial.<<>>BACKGROUND: Cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBGT) is a first-line treatment for social anxiety disorder (SAD). However, since many patients remain symptomatic post-treatment, there is a need for augmenting procedures. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) examined the potential augmentation effect of attention bias modification (ABM) for CBGT. METHODS: Fifty patients with SAD from three therapy groups were randomized to receive an 18-week standard CBGT with either ABM designed to shift attention away from threat (CBGT + ABM), or a placebo protocol not designed to modify threat-related attention (CBGT + placebo). Therapy groups took place in a large mental health center. Clinician and self-report measures of social anxiety and depression were acquired pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 3-month follow-up. Attention bias was assessed at pre- and post-treatment. RESULTS: Patients randomized to the CBGT + ABM group, relative to those randomized to the CBGT + placebo group, showed greater reductions in clinician-rated SAD symptoms post-treatment, with effects maintained at 3-month follow-up. Group differences were not evident for self-report or attention-bias measures, with similar reductions in both groups. Finally, reduction in attention bias did not mediate the association between group and reduction in Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale Structured Interview (LSAS) scores. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first RCT to examine the possible augmenting effect of ABM added to group-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for adult SAD. Training patients' attention away from threat might augment the treatment response to standard CBGT in SAD, a possibility that could be further evaluated in large-scale RCTs.
30773638<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Anxiety and the dynamic self as defined by the prospection and mental simulation of looming future threats.<<>>A more dynamic perspective of threats to the self may contribute to an enhanced understanding of the processes that develop and maintain anxiety and thus, potentially inform psychological interventions. This article presents the looming vulnerability of anxiety, which stresses the threat or risk prospection and dynamic mental simulation of the course of threat. Individuals do not become anxious simply because they picture distant or static possible threats that represent threats to the self. Rather, their anxiety results from interpreting potential threats as dynamic, growing, and approaching. Following a review of a wide range of literature from clinical, personality, and social psychology, we present the looming vulnerability and its underpinnings in evolution and examine its applications to cognitive vulnerability to anxiety and its therapeutic alleviation. We also address the associations of the model to other self-related concepts that are involved in anxiety.
26476635<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Enhanced Early Posterior Negativity to Fearful Faces in Patients with Anxiety Disorder.<<>>Patients with anxiety disorders (AnDs) have distinct patterns of threat-related emotional processing compared to healthy controls (HCs). The current study investigated the temporal course of emotional processing in AnDs by examining Event-related potential (ERP) components. Twenty-three AnDs and twenty-four age- and gender-matched HCs viewed emotional (fearful, happy) and neutral faces while their electroencephalograms were recorded. Early (P100, N170), middle (early posterior negativity; EPN), and late ERP components late positive potential were analyzed. To localize ERP source activity, standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) was used. AnDs displayed significantly enhanced mean amplitude of the EPN compared to HCs when fearful faces were presented. In addition, the EPN's mean amplitude elicited by fearful faces was more pronounced than for happy and neutral faces in AnDs, whereas in HCs the EPN elicited by fearful faces was only augmented compared to neutral faces. Finally, sLORETA analysis revealed that the source activity of the EPN (fearful minus happy face condition) was increased in the cuneus and precuneus in AnDs compared to HCs. Our results indicate that the EPN is a distinct ERP component modulated by facial emotional processing in AnDs. Furthermore, the results show that anxiety symptoms enhance selective attention for fearful faces. Finally, it revealed that the cuneus and precuneus are involved in fearful face processing in AnDs.
21918000<<>>Potential_Threat_Anxiety<<>>Human proprioceptive adaptations during states of height-induced fear and anxiety.<<>>Clinical and experimental research has demonstrated that the emotional experience of fear and anxiety impairs postural stability in humans. The current study investigated whether changes in fear and anxiety can also modulate spinal stretch reflexes and the gain of afferent inputs to the primary somatosensory cortex. To do so, two separate experiments were performed on two separate groups of participants while they stood under conditions of low and high postural threat. In experiment 1, the proprioceptive system was probed using phasic mechanical stimulation of the Achilles tendon while simultaneously recording the ensuing tendon reflexes in the soleus muscle and cortical-evoked potentials over the somatosensory cortex during low and high threat conditions. In experiment 2, phasic electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve was used to examine the effect of postural threat on somatosensory evoked potentials. Results from experiment 1 demonstrated that soleus tendon reflex excitability was facilitated during states of height-induced fear and anxiety while the magnitude of the tendon-tap-evoked cortical potential was not significantly different between threat conditions. Results from experiment 2 demonstrated that the amplitudes of somatosensory-evoked potentials were also unchanged between threat conditions. The results support the hypothesis that muscle spindle sensitivity in the triceps surae muscles may be facilitated when humans stand under conditions of elevated postural threat, although the presumed increase in spindle sensitivity does not result in higher afferent feedback gain at the level of the somatosensory cortex.
9821976<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Sleep-wakefulness alterations in amygdala-kindled rats.<<>>PURPOSE: Our aim was to study the relation between epilepsy and sleep-wakefulness cycles in the amygdala-kindling model of temporal lobe epilepsy. METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats were electrically kindled through bipolar electrodes implanted in the anterior amygdala. Polysomnographic recordings were taken before and after kindled seizures for 6 h. For the studies on the effects of a single, full-blown seizure, recordings were taken immediately after the seizure and daily thereafter until the recordings returned to baseline values. For studies on the effects of five full-blown seizures, recordings were taken immediately after the fifth seizure and then on day 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, and 28. RESULTS: Polysomnographic recordings taken immediately after the first full-blown seizure revealed an initial increase in the duration of deep slow-wave sleep (SII), a decrease in the light slow-wave sleep (SI) stage of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and a decrease in the quiet wakefulness (W2) stage of wakefulness. All these parameters returned to baseline values after 24 h. The duration of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep increased and returned to the baseline value after 48 h. Five consecutive full-blown seizures caused an increase in the duration of SII from the day the seizures occured until day 28, whereas the duration of SI decreased for 72 h. The duration of REM sleep, decreased only on the day of the seizures and day 1, while decreases in the number of REM episodes were observed on the day of the seizure, day 2 and day 14. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that even a single, full-blown seizure can cause alterations in the architecture of sleep-wakefulness cycles for a short duration, and that multiple seizures produce long-term effects.
11236695<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[The regulation of NO on sleep-wakefulness in rats].<<>>AIM AND METHODS: The effects of an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase L-NAME and a precursor of NO(L-arginine) on sleep-wakefulness in rats were examined. RESULTS: 1. The time of waking was increased(P < 0.01) and the time of SWS was decreased(P < 0.01) during the first two hours after injection intracerebroventricularly(i.c.v.) of L-NAME 1 mg, this effect was showed across the 4 h recording period(P < 0.05). The i.c.v. injection of L-NAME 0.2 mg had no significant effect. 2. The time of waking was su-ppressed during the third and fourth hours after i.c.v. injection of L-arginine 300 micrograms(P < 0.05). At the same time the increase of SWS was observed (P < 0.01). 3. There was no change on W, SWS, PS when L-NAME 1 mg was given after administration of L-arginine. CONCLUSION: The excitatory effect of L-NAME on wakefulness is mediated by inhibition of NOS. This effect could be antagonized by L-arginine. It suggests that NO is involved in regulation of sleep-wakefulness.
14722706<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Effects of three hypnotics on the sleep-wakefulness cycle in sleep-disturbed rats.<<>>RATIONALE: New sleep disturbance model in rats is useful for estimating the characteristics of some hypnotics. OBJECTIVES: The present study was undertaken to investigate the utility of a sleep disturbance model by placing rats on a grid suspended over water using three kinds of hypnotics, that is, short-acting benzodiazepine (triazolam), intermediate-acting benzodiazepine (flunitrazepam) and long-acting barbiturate (phenobarbital). METHODS: Electrodes for measurement of EEG and EMG were implanted into the frontal cortex and the dorsal neck muscle of rats. EEG and EMG were recorded with an electroencephalogram. SleepSign ver.2.0 was used for EEG and EMG analysis. Total times of wakefulness, non-REM and REM sleep were measured from 0900 to 1500 hours. RESULTS: In rats placed on the grid suspended over water up to 1 cm under the grid surface, not only triazolam but also flunitrazepam and phenobarbital caused a shortening of sleep latency. Both flunitrazepam and phenobarbital were effective in increasing of total non-REM sleep time in rats placed on sawdust or the grid, and the effects of both drugs in rats placed on the grid were larger than those in rats placed on sawdust. Measurement of the hourly non-REM sleep time was useful for investigating the peak time and duration of effect of the three hypnotics. Phenobarbital showed a decrease in total REM sleep time in rats placed on the grid, although both triazolam and flunitrazepam were without effect. CONCLUSIONS: The present insomnia model can be used as a sleep disturbance model for testing not only the sleep-inducing effects but also the sleep-maintaining effects including non-REM sleep and REM sleep of hypnotics.
17652994<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[Pharmacological approach to desychronization of the sleep-wakefulness cycle in the military and sport environment].<<>>Sports and military environments have many common features - intense physical activity, rigorous physical environment (heat, cold, high or low pressure, hypoxia, acceleration...), specific psychosocial atmosphere, team spirit. If combined with jet lag syndrome, these specific conditions can favor altered physical and mental performance. There is always the temptation to use drugs as a simple way to reduce the penalizing effects. The available compounds known to affect sleep and wakefulness include hypnotics, benzodiazepines and non benzodiazepines such as temazepam, zolopidem, and zopiclone, stimulants such as amphetamine and amphetamine-like agents, adrafinil, modafinil, caffeine and chronobiotics substances such as melatonin and, more recently, slow release caffeine. In the sports area, all of these substances except caffeine are on the list of forbidden products, although special authorizations linked to known disease conditions are allowed. In the military setting, the environment may be similar, but the context of use is very different. In the context of a rescue mission, the current practice in the French military organization is to place modafinil pills in the ejection seat of fight planes and in rescue boats. A second context is the use of anti-sleep agents under orders; the debate continues on this and the appropriate recommendations in this context. Self-medication is a third condition, in which case no rules have been defined.
28489018<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Estimating sleep parameters using nasal pressure signals applicable to continuous positive airway pressure devices.<<>>OBJECTIVE: This paper proposes a method for classifying sleep-wakefulness and estimating sleep parameters using nasal pressure signals applicable to a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device. APPROACH: In order to classify the sleep-wakefulness states of patients with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), apnea-hypopnea and snoring events are first detected. Epochs detected as SDB are classified as sleep, and time-domain- and frequency-domain-based features are extracted from the epochs that are detected as normal breathing. Subsequently, sleep-wakefulness is classified using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier in the normal breathing epoch. Finally, four sleep parameters-sleep onset, wake after sleep onset, total sleep time and sleep efficiency-are estimated based on the classified sleep-wakefulness. In order to develop and test the algorithm, 110 patients diagnosed with SDB participated in this study. Ninety of the subjects underwent full-night polysomnography (PSG) and twenty underwent split-night PSG. The subjects were divided into 50 patients of a training set (full/split: 42/8), 30 of a validation set (full/split: 24/6) and 30 of a test set (full/split: 24/6). MAIN RESULTS: In the experiments conducted, sleep-wakefulness classification accuracy was found to be 83.2% in the test set, compared with the PSG scoring results of clinical experts. Furthermore, all four sleep parameters showed higher correlations than the results obtained via PSG (r 0.84, p < 0.05). In order to determine whether the proposed method is applicable to CPAP, sleep-wakefulness classification performances were evaluated for each CPAP in the split-night PSG data. The results indicate that the accuracy and sensitivity of sleep-wakefulness classification by CPAP variation shows no statistically significant difference (p < 0.05). SIGNIFICANCE: The contributions made in this study are applicable to the automatic classification of sleep-wakefulness states in CPAP devices and evaluation of the quality of sleep.
10691108<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Effects of vigabatrin on sleep-wakefulness cycle in amygdala-kindled rats.<<>>PURPOSE: Our aim was to study the effect of prolonged administration of vigabatrin (VGB) on sleep-wakefulness cycle in kindled seizure-induced rats. METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats were implanted stereotaxically with electrodes for kindling and polysomnography. The rats were divided into two groups, kindled and VGB-treated kindled rats. VGB was administered intraperitonially every day for 21 days, and polysomnographic recordings were taken after doses 1, 7, 14, and 21. The drug effects were evaluated by comparing the records of kindled and drug-treated kindled rats. RESULTS: The VGB-administered kindled rats showed an increase in total sleep time (TST) due to an increase in total non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and light slow-wave sleep stage I (SI) with a decrease in wakefulness. The number of episodes and REM onset latencies were found to be decreased after drug treatment. CONCLUSIONS: It can therefore be concluded that VGB has a somnolence-inducing effect and that it might mediate its anticonvulsant effect by altering sleep architecture through sleep-regulating areas.
16297476<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>A controlled intervention study on the effects of a very rapidly forward rotating shift system on sleep-wakefulness and well-being among young and elderly shift workers.<<>>Shift work is related to problems in sleep/wakefulness and social life. The effects of a very rapidly forward rotating shift system on sleep, health and well-being of young (-45) and elderly (45+) maintenance workers were studied by a controlled intervention study. In the beginning, all the workers had a continuous backward rotating three-shift system. A very quickly forward rotating shift system was developed, avoiding consecutive night shifts and with more free-time between the individual shifts. The effect of the new shift system on sleep/wakefulness and general well-being was studied by questionnaire and field studies including on-site registration of sleep (actigraphy), subjective sleepiness (KSS) and psychomotor performance (PVT). Based on a linear mixed model for repeated measurements, the new shift system increased the main sleep length after the night shift and improved alertness and PVT performance during the night shift among the older workers. Alertness also improved during free-time after the night shift and sleep complaints decreased after all shifts. The workers on the new shift schedule perceived the effects of the new shift system on sleep, alertness, general health, well-being at work, social and family life more positively than the workers in the old shift system. At the end of the study, all subjects voted for the new shift system. It is concluded that although the new shift system increased the operating hours at night, the very rapidly forward rotating shift system had positive effects on the sleep, alertness and well-being of especially the older shift workers.
9639274<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>The role of alpha-2 receptors in the medial preoptic area in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness and body temperature.<<>>The study was conducted on 48 free-moving male rats to find out the role of the medial preoptic alpha2 receptors in the regulation of sleep and body temperature. Recording electrodes for assessment of sleep-wakefulness, and injector cannulae for injection of drugs in the medial preoptic area were chronically fixed on the skulls of the animals. The noradrenergic fibres projecting to the medial preoptic area were destroyed in 24 rats by administration of 6-hydroxydopamine at the ventral noradrenergic bundle. Though arousal was produced in normal rats by the injection of the alpha2 adrenergic agonist, clonidine, at the medial preoptic area, it induced sedation in rats with noradrenergic fibre lesion. Clonidine did not alter the rectal temperature in normal rats but it induced hypothermia in lesioned rats. Injection of alpha2 antagonist, yohimbine, at the medial preoptic area induced sleep in rats with intact noradrenergic fibres. However, the sleep inducing effect of this drug was very much attenuated in the lesioned animals. There was no significant change in body temperature, in both these groups of animals, after yohimbine administration. The study indicates the role of presynaptic alpha2 adrenergic receptors in arousal response and indirectly supports the contention that the alpha1 postsynaptic receptors at the medial preoptic area are involved in hypnogenesis. It also suggests that the thermal changes induced by adrenergic system are mediated through alpha1 postsynaptic receptors. But the thermal changes do not contribute towards the induced alterations in sleep-wakefulness. It is proposed that there should be separate sets of noradrenergic terminals for regulation of sleep and body temperature.
20711757<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Ectopic overexpression of orexin alters sleep/wakefulness states and muscle tone regulation during REM sleep in mice.<<>>Orexins (also called hypocretins), which are neuropeptides exclusively expressed by a population of neurons specifically localized in the lateral hypothalamic area, are critically implicated in the regulation of sleep/wake states. Orexin deficiency results in narcoleptic phenotype in rodents, dogs, and humans, suggesting that orexins are important for maintaining consolidated wakefulness states. However, the physiological effect of constitutive increased orexinergic transmission tone, which might be important for understanding the effects of orexin agonists that are promising candidates for therapeutic agents of narcolepsy, has not been fully characterized. We report here the sleep/wakefulness abnormalities in transgenic mice that exhibit widespread overexpression of a rat prepro-orexin transgene driven by a beta-actin/cytomegalovirus hybrid promoter (CAG/orexin transgenic mice). CAG/orexin mice exhibit sleep abnormalities with fragmentation of non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep episode and a reduction in REM sleep. Non-REM sleep was frequently disturbed by short episodes of wakefulness. EEG/EMG studies also reveal incomplete REM sleep atonia with abnormal myoclonic activity during this sleep stage. These results suggest that endogenous orexinergic activity should be appropriately regulated for normal maintenance of sleep states. Orexinergic transmission should be activated during wakefulness, while it should be inactivated or decreased during sleep state to maintain appropriate vigilance states.
14564893<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>The effect of a change in sleep-wakefulness timing, bright light and physical exercise interventions on 24-hour patterns of performance, mood and body temperature.<<>>Experiments consisting of baseline, bright light and physical exercise studies were carried out to compare the effect of a 9-hour delay in sleep-wakefulness timing, and the effects of bright light and physical exercise interventions on 24-hour patterns of performance, mood and body temperature were examined. Each study comprised a 24-hour constant routine at the beginning followed by 3 night shifts and 24-hour constant routine at the end. Performance on tasks differing in cognitive load, mood and body temperature was measured during each constant routine and the interventions were applied during the night shifts. The 24-hour pattern of alertness and performance on the tasks with low cognitive load in post-treatment conditions followed the change in sleep-wakefulness timing while more cognitively loaded tasks tended to show a reverse trend when compared to pre-treatment conditions. There was a phase delay around 4 hours in circadian rhythms of body temperature in post-treatment conditions.
15313041<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Changes in thermal preference, sleep-wakefulness, body temperature and locomotor activity of rats during continuous recording for 24 hours.<<>>This study was aimed at correlating diurnal changes in thermal preference of rats with their body temperature (Tb), sleep-wakefulness (S-W) and locomotor activity (LMA). Electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), electrooculogram (EOG) and Tb were recorded by telemetry, while an activity monitor measured LMA and thermal preference. A special environmental chamber, which was designed and fabricated, enabled for the first time, simultaneous measurement of thermal preference, along with S-W and Tb. S-W, thermal preference and LMA were recorded continuously in six adult male Wistar rats, for 24 h, for 3 days, and Tb with thermal preference and LMA were recorded for another 3 days. LMA and Tb were higher at night than during day. The rats slept less during the night time. Increased frequency of sleep episodes contributed towards increased sleep during day time. They preferred an ambient temperature (Tamb) of 24 degrees C at night and 27 degrees C during the day. Though the preference for higher Tamb during day time coincided with increased sleep, the rats did not move over to higher Tamb prior to the onset of sleep episodes. Though the diurnal alterations in sleep, Tb and LMA were similar to those reports from animals kept in constant Tamb, the day-night variation of paradoxical sleep (PS) was exaggerated when the rats selected their own preferred Tamb.
29804297<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>A single episode of binge alcohol drinking causes sleep disturbance, disrupts sleep homeostasis, and down-regulates equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1.<<>>Binge alcohol drinking, a risky pattern of alcohol consumption, has severe consequences toward health and well-being of an individual, his family, and society. Although, binge drinking has detrimental effects on sleep, underlying mechanisms are unknown. We used adult male C57BL/6J mice and exposed them to a single, 4-h session of binge alcohol self-administration, in stress-free environment, to examine neuronal mechanisms affecting sleep. We first verified binge pattern of alcohol consumption. When allowed to self-administer alcohol in a non-stressful environment, mice consumed alcohol in a binge pattern. Next, effect of binge drinking on sleep-wakefulness was monitored. While sleep-wakefulness remained unchanged during drinking session, significant increase in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep was observed during 4 h of active period post-binge, followed by increased wakefulness, reduced sleep during subsequent sleep (light) period; although the timing of sleep onset (at lights-on) remained unaffected. Next, electrophysiological and biochemical indicators of sleep homeostasis were examined using sleep deprivation-recovery sleep paradigm. Mice exposed to binge drinking did not show an increase in cortical theta power and basal forebrain adenosine levels during sleep deprivation; NREM sleep and NREM delta power did not increase during recovery sleep suggesting that mice exposed to binge alcohol do not develop sleep pressure. Our final experiment examined expression of genes regulating sleep homeostasis following binge drinking. While binge drinking did not affect adenosine kinase and A1 receptor, expression of equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) was significantly reduced. These results suggest that binge alcohol consumption-induced down-regulation of ENT1 expression may disrupt sleep homeostasis and cause sleep disturbances.

24930893<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Acute binge alcohol administration reverses sleep-wake cycle in Sprague Dawley rats.<<>>BACKGROUND: Binge alcohol drinking is among the most common pattern of alcohol consumption in our society. Binge alcohol consumption has serious negative consequence on mental and physical health. Although alcohol consumption is known to have profound impact on sleep, it is yet unknown as to how binge alcohol affects/alters sleep-wakefulness. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of acute binge alcohol administration on sleep-wakefulness. METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats were used in the study. Under standard aseptic surgical conditions, rats (N = 7) were implanted with sleep-recording electrodes. After postoperative recovery and habituation, baseline sleep-wakefulness was recorded. Subsequently, rats were exposed to binge alcohol treatment as follows: One hour before light onset, a priming dose of 5 g/kg of alcohol was administered followed by 2 subsequent doses (adjusted based on the intoxication level of the rat) approximately 8 hours apart. Sleep-wakefulness was continuously recorded for 3 days post-binge. RESULTS: Acute binge alcohol administration had no significant effect on sleep-wakefulness on post-binge Day 1. However, on post-binge Day 2, after blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was 0, sleep disruptions were observed manifested by a reversal of sleep-wakefulness as evident from insomnia-like symptoms (significant increase in wakefulness; significant reduction in nonrapid eye movement [NREM] sleep) during the normal sleep (light) period and excessive sleep (significant increase in NREM sleep) during the normal active (dark) period similar to excessive daytime sleepiness in humans. All sleep-wakefulness changes were normalized on Day 3 post-binge. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol hangover is defined as the presence of unpleasant symptoms that peak when BAC is 0. Our results suggest that the reversal of sleep-wakefulness accompanies alcohol hangover after binge alcohol administration.
10459680<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Night-day-night sleep-wakefulness monitoring by ambulatory integrated circuit memories.<<>>A medium-sized portable digital recorder with fully integrated circuit (IC) memories for sleep monitoring has been developed. It has five amplifiers for EEG, EMG, EOG, ECG, and a signal of body acceleration or respiration sound, four event markers, an 8 ch A/D converter, a digital signal processor (DSP), 192 Mbytes IC flash memories, and batteries. The whole system weighs 1200 g including batteries and is put into a small bag worn on the subject's waist or carried in their hand. The sampling rate for each input channel is programmable through the DSP. This apparatus is valuable for continuously monitoring the states of sleep-wakefulness over 24 h, making a night-day-night recording possible in a hospital, home, or car.
28642284<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Excitation of GABAergic Neurons in the Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis Triggers Immediate Transition from Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep to Wakefulness in Mice.<<>>Emotionally salient situations usually trigger arousal along with autonomic and neuroendocrine reactions. To determine whether the extended amygdala plays a role in sleep-wakefulness regulation, we examined the effects of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic excitation of GABAergic neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (GABA(BNST) neurons). Acute optogenetic excitation of these cells during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep resulted in an immediate state transition to wakefulness, whereas stimulation during REM sleep showed no effect on sleep-wakefulness states in male mice. An anterograde tracing study suggested GABA(BNST) neurons send axonal projections to several brain regions implicated in arousal, including the preoptic area, lateral hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, deep mesencephalic nucleus, and parabrachial nucleus. A dual orexin receptor antagonist, DORA-22, did not affect the optogenetic transition from NREM sleep to wakefulness. Chemogenetic excitation of GABA(BNST) neurons evoked a sustained wakefulness state, but this arousal effect was markedly attenuated by DORA-22. These observations suggest that GABA(BNST) neurons play an important role in transition from NREM sleep to wakefulness without the function of orexin neurons, but prolonged excitation of these cells mobilizes the orexin system to sustain wakefulness.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We examined the role of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the regulation of wakefulness. Optogenetic excitation of GABAergic neurons in the BNST (GABA(BNST) neurons) during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in mice resulted in immediate transition to a wakefulness state without function of orexins. Prolonged excitation of GABA(BNST) neurons by a chemogenetic method evoked a longer-lasting, sustained wakefulness state, which was abolished by preadministration of a dual orexin receptor antagonist, DORA-22. This study revealed a role of the BNST GABAergic system in sleep-wakefulness control, especially in shifting animals' behavioral states from NREM sleep to wakefulness, and provides an important insight into the pathophysiology of insomnia and the role of orexin in arousal regulation.
29220862<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>A descriptive analysis of sleep and wakefulness states during maternal behaviors in postpartum rats.<<>>Mother rats spend most of their time nursing their litter during the early stages of the postpartum period, only occasionally leaving the nest. The suckling stimulus from the pups elicits the adoption of nursing postures, during which milk ejection occurs, an event associated with the occurrence of non-REM (NREM) sleep in the rat. Despite this evidence, the characteristics of sleep during different nursing postures along the postpartum period remain unknown. The present study aims to describe the sleep pattern of mother rats while nursing, hovering over their pups and when being away from the pups. For this purpose, lactating females were implanted with electrodes for chronic polysomnographic recording. Simultaneous recordings of sleep-wakefulness cycle and maternal behaviors were performed in both the light and dark phases of the first and second postpartum weeks. Results indicate that while mothers were most of the time awake when hovering over pups and when staying away from pups, they mainly remained in NREM sleep when adopting low kyphosis posture, the most common nursing posture. The sleep-wake pattern during most maternal behaviors was quite stable between the light and dark phases of the first and second postpartum weeks. In addition, the sleep fragmentation was higher during the nursing bouts compared to that observed when mother rats slept without the pups, but sleep depth did not differ between these behaviors. Our results provide an original description of how mother rats synchronize their own sleep-wakefulness cycle with the maternal care of the pups during the postpartum period.
15680193<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Changes in sleep-wakefulness in the medial preoptic area lesioned rats: role of thermal preference.<<>>Changes in sleep-wakefulness (S-W) were studied in adult male Wistar rats, along with body temperature (T(b)), locomotor activity (LMA) and thermal preference, after the lesion of the medial preoptic area (mPOA) with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA). The sleep was decreased after the lesion of the mPOA, but there was recovery when the rats were given freedom to stay in an ambient temperature (T(amb)) which they preferred. When given a choice between three T(amb) (24, 27 and 30 degrees C), the rats preferred 27 degrees C before the mPOA lesion, and 24 degrees C during the initial days after the lesion. There was a shift in the thermal preference to 30 degrees C, on the fourth week after the lesion, which coincided with the considerable recovery of sleep. The preference for higher T(amb) probably helped to improve sleep, as T(amb) of 30 degrees C is known to promote sleep. When the lesioned rats were not given the freedom to select the T(amb), there was no recovery in sleep. The mPOA seems to be essential for increasing the durations of slow wave sleep (SWS) episodes, especially the light SWS (S1), as they remained shorter than the pre-lesion value, even when the rats were given freedom to stay in a preferred T(amb). The homeostatic recovery of sleep, especially the night time sleep, resulted in the disruption of circadian sleep rhythm. But, the LMA, T(b) and thermal preference maintained their diurnal variation. T(b) and LMA were elevated after the mPOA lesion and they remained so till the end of the study.
29654707<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Melatonin promotes sleep in mice by inhibiting orexin neurons in the perifornical lateral hypothalamus.<<>>Melatonin promotes sleep. However, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Orexin neurons in the perifornical lateral hypothalamus (PFH) are pivotal for wake promotion. Does melatonin promote sleep by inhibiting orexin neurons? We used C57BL/6J mice and designed 4 experiments to address this question. Experiment 1 used double-labeled immunofluorescence and examined the presence of melatonin receptors on orexin neurons. Second, mice, implanted with bilateral guides targeted toward PFH and sleep-recording electrodes, were infused with melatonin (500 pmole/50 nL/side) at dark onset (onset of active period), and spontaneous bouts of sleep-wakefulness were examined. Third, mice, implanted with bilateral guides into the PFH, were infused with melatonin (500 pmole/50 nL/side) at dark onset and euthanized 2 hours later, to examine the activation of orexin neurons using c-Fos expression in orexin neurons. Fourth, mice, implanted with PFH bilateral guides and sleep-recording electrodes, were infused with melatonin receptor antagonist, luzindole (10 pmol/50 nL/side), at light onset (onset of sleep period), and spontaneous bouts of sleep-wakefulness were examined. Our results suggest that orexin neurons express MT1, but not MT2 receptors. Melatonin infusion into the PFH, at dark onset, site-specifically and significantly increased NREM sleep (43.7%, P = .003) and reduced wakefulness (12.3%, P = .013). Local melatonin infusion at dark onset inhibited orexin neurons as evident by a significant reduction (66%, P = .0004) in the number of orexin neurons expressing c-Fos. Finally, luzindole infusion-induced blockade of melatonin receptors in PFH at sleep onset significantly increased wakefulness (44.1%, P = .015). Based on these results, we suggest that melatonin may act via the MT1 receptors to inhibit orexin neurons and promote sleep.
11382912<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Effect of ambient temperature on sleep-wakefulness in normal and medial preoptic area lesioned rats.<<>>The changes in sleep-wakefulness were studied in rats during their exposure to different ambient temperatures of 18 degrees C, 24 degrees C and 30 degrees C, before and after the destruction of the medial preoptic area neurons by N-Methyl D-aspartic acid. In normal rats, there was an increase in paradoxical sleep and slow wave sleep and a decrease in wakefulness at higher ambient temperatures. The increase in sleep was primarily due to an increase in the duration of sleep episodes. Destruction of the medial preoptic area neurons produced a decrease in sleep at all three different ambient temperatures. But, there was a linear increase in sleep with higher temperatures in the lesioned rats that was qualitatively different from that in the normal animals, as the increase in sleep was associated with an increase in the number of short duration slow wave sleep episodes. The findings indicate that the medial preoptic area is essential for sleep maintenance and improving the quality of sleep with higher ambient temperatures. It is possible that the medial preoptic area serves as a fine-tuning mechanism to regulate sleep for energy homeostasis, including thermoregulation.
15541420<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Effects of chlorogenic acid and its metabolites on the sleep-wakefulness cycle in rats.<<>>The effect of chlorogenic acid on the sleep-wakefulness cycle in rats was investigated in comparison with those of caffeic acid (the metabolite of chlorogenic acid) and dihydrocaffeic acid (the metabolite of caffeic acid). A significant prolongation of sleep latency was observed with chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid at a dose of 500 and 200 mg/kg, respectively. On the other hand, no remarkable effects were observed with dihydrocaffeic acid even at a dose of 500 mg/kg. Caffeine caused a significant increase in sleep latency and waking time and decrease in non-rapid eye movement sleep time at a dose of 10 mg/kg. In contrast, chlorogenic acid and its metabolites had no significant effects on each sleep state. From these results, it may be concluded that chrologenic acid caused a mild arousal effect compared with that of caffeine, and the effect of chlorogenic acid may have occurred through its metabolite caffeic acid.
26119352<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Nicotine administration in the wake-promoting basal forebrain attenuates sleep-promoting effects of alcohol.<<>>Nicotine and alcohol co-abuse is highly prevalent, although the underlying causes are unclear. It has been suggested that nicotine enhances pleasurable effects of alcohol while reducing aversive effects. Recently, we reported that nicotine acts via the basal forebrain (BF) to activate nucleus accumbens and increase alcohol consumption. Does nicotine suppress alcohol-induced aversive effects via the BF? We hypothesized that nicotine may act via the BF to suppress sleep-promoting effects of alcohol. To test this hypothesis, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with sleep-recording electrodes and bilateral guides targeted toward the BF. Nicotine (75 pmol/500 nL/side) or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; 500 nL/side) was microinjected into the BF followed by intragastric alcohol (ACSF + EtOH and NiC + EtOH groups; 3 g/kg) or water (NiC + W and ACSF + W groups; 10 mL/kg) administration. On completion, rats were killed and processed to localize injection sites in the BF. The statistical analysis revealed a significant effect of treatment on sleep-wakefulness. While rats exposed to alcohol (ACSF + EtOH) displayed strong sleep promotion, nicotine pre-treatment in the BF (NiC + EtOH) attenuated alcohol-induced sleep and normalized sleep-wakefulness. These results suggest that nicotine acts via the BF to suppress the aversive, sleep-promoting effects of alcohol, further supporting the role of BF in alcohol-nicotine co-use.
15828428<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[The role of opioid system in the regulation of the sleep-wakefulness cycle].<<>>In chronic experiments influence of single administration of various doses of morphine (0.5, 2.0 and 3.0 mg/kg) on general behavior, structural organization of the sleep-waking cycle and some EEG and somato-vegetative parameters was studied in the cats. Intraperitoneal administration of morphine elicits numerous autonomic disorders, psychic derangement and complete deterioration of the sleep-waking cycle structure. The result certify that single administration of morphine induces activation of the opiate receptors in various structures of the brain, which entails deviations of behavioral and EEG parameters, activation of the structures responsible for initiation of behavioral waking, suppression of activity in those structure, which control the slow wave sleep triggering mechanisms, deterioration of the sleep quality and significant elevation of emotional tension against the baseline. On the basis of obtained data it is suggested that the opioid system plays an important role in the sleep-waking cycle regulatory mechanisms and other forms of brain integrative activity in general.
30935682<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus mediate the arousal-promoting effect of orexin during isoflurane anesthesia in male rats.<<>>Previous studies have demonstrated that the activation of orexinergic neurons facilitates the recovery of animals from general anesthesia. Moreover, serotonergic neurons that receive projections from orexin neurons have also been shown to participate in sleep-wakefulness regulation. In the present study, we aimed to explore whether orexinergic neurons facilitate emergence from isoflurane anesthesia in rats by activating serotonergic neurons. Orexin A (30 or 100pmol), orexin B (30 or 100pmol), and their respective antagonists SB-334867 and TCS-OX2-29 (5 or 20mug) were microinjected into the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) of rats, and their effects on induction and emergence times were analyzed. Electroencephalogram (EEG) changes were also recorded and analyzed to illuminate the effect of orexin injection into the DRN on cortical excitability under isoflurane anesthesia. Activation of serotonergic neurons was detected via immunohistochemical analysis of c-Fos expression following orexin administration. Our results indicated that injection of neither orexins nor orexin antagonists into the rat DRN exerted an impact on induction time, whereas orexin-A injection (100pmol) enhanced arousal when compared with the saline group. In contrast, administration of orexin receptor type 1 antagonist SB-334867 (20mug) prolonged emergence time from isoflurane anesthesia. Microinjection of orexin-A induced an arousal pattern on EEG, and decreased the burst suppression ratio under isoflurane anesthesia. Isoflurane anesthesia inhibited the activity of serotonergic neurons, as shown by decrease in the number of c-Fos-immunoreactive serotonergic neurons when compared with the sham group. This inhibitory effect was partially reversed by administration of orexin-A. Taken together, our findings suggest that orexinergic signals facilitate emergence from isoflurane anesthesia, at least partially, by reversing the effects of isoflurane on serotonergic neurons of the DRN.
15139033<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Sleep-wake states and cortical synchronization control by pregnenolone sulfate into the pedunculopontine nucleus.<<>>Cholinergic neurons of the pedunculopontine tegmentum nucleus (PPT) are crucial for initiation and maintenance of electroencephalographic (EEG) desynchronization states like paradoxical sleep and wakefulness. These neurons are regulated by classical neurotransmitter systems from the pontomesencephalic reticular formation and basal ganglia. In addition to this regulation, PPT neuron activity could be modulated by endogenous neurosteroids and particularly by pregnenolone sulfate (PREG-S) because synthesis enzymes of this neurosteroid are present in this area and peripheral administrations of PREG-S affect sleep-wakefulness states. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effects of different doses of PREG-S infusion into the PPT on sleep-wakefulness states in rats. Our results show dose-dependent effects of PREG-S on sleep-wakefulness states. Low concentration of PREG-S (5 ng) increased the amount of paradoxical sleep without any modification of slow wave sleep and wakefulness. High level of PREG-S (10 and 20 ng) increased paradoxical sleep and slow wave sleep together with an increase of delta power and a decrease of theta power during wakefulness. Dependent on the doses used, PREG-S thus can promote paradoxical sleep alone or the global propensity to fall asleep, impairing the quality of wakefulness. These results unveil a new regulation pathway for PPT neurons and strengthen the role of PREG-S in sleep-wakefulness regulation.
8550132<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Effect of application of gamma amino butyric acid at the medial preoptic area on sleep-wakefulness.<<>>Intracerebral microinjections of gamma amino butyric acid were given bilaterally at the medial preoptic area (mPOA) to determine the possible role of this neurotransmitter in the genesis and regulation of sleep-wakefulness. GABA (50 micrograms/0.2 microliters) when administered through chronically implanted cannulae in free moving rats, did not produce any significant alterations in sleep-wakefulness. This may be attributed either to the non-involvement of GABA at the level of mPOA in the regulation of sleep, or to other factors like the low dose and rapid breakdown of the injected drug.
8122256<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>The development of sleep-wakefulness rhythm in normal infants and young children.<<>>The development of circadian sleep-wakefulness rhythm was investigated by a longitudinal study of two normal newborns for two and a half years and by a transversal study of 182 normal infants and young children living in three different areas of Japan. The circadian rhythm became established before 4 months of age, and daytime sleep became concentrated within two time periods from 7 months of age, and then within a single peak from 14 months of age. The time period 00:00-04:00 developed into the "absolute sleep period" from 3 months of age, and the "absolute wakefulness period" appeared first in the time period 08:00-11:00 from 14 months of age, and then in the time period 16:00-21:00 from one and a half years of age. Establishment of circadian rhythm as indicated by the numbers of sleep epochs in daytime and in nighttime, and the longest continuous sleep or wakefulness periods reflect the development of the nervous system and were influenced by the change of light-dark in the environment. These parameters showed critical ages, but not sexual or regional differences. However, regional differences were found in the times of waking up in morning and falling asleep at night. This indicated the phase of the circadian rhythm was also influenced by natural and social environmental factors.
3125374<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Effects of L-erythro-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylserine on sleep-wakefulness patterns and concentrations of brain catecholamines and serotonin in rats.<<>>The effects of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine (DOPS), a nonnatural precursor of noradrenaline, on the sleep-wakefulness patterns of rats were studied. When the animals received an intraperitoneal injection of L-erythro-DOPS (200 mg/kg), a significant increase in slow wave sleep and a tendency to decrease wakefulness were observed during the first 2 hours after the injection. Paradoxical sleep increased 4-8 hours after the treatment. A simultaneous injection of benserazide (20 mg/kg) enhanced these effects. L-threo-DOPS (200 mg/kg, i.p.) had no effect on the sleep-wakefulness patterns. The effects of DOPS on the concentrations of brain catecholamines and serotonin in rats were also examined. An intraperitoneal injection of L-erythro-DOPS markedly increased the concentration of noradrenaline (probably the d-form) and decreased that of serotonin and dopamine. L-threo-DOPS had no effect on the brain monoamine levels of the rats in the present experimental condition. The effects of L-erythro-DOPS on the neurons containing noradrenaline in the rats were examined by fluorescence histochemistry. Fluorescence in the neuronal perikarya and fibers containing noradrenaline markedly increased in the n. coeruleus, n. paraventricularis and cerebral cortex after an intraperitoneal injection of amino acid. Fibers containing the fluorescence also increased in the second two areas.
3247018<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Aspects of sleep-wakefulness architecture by computer analysis in cats.<<>>In the present study, using an automatic method to discriminate the stages of sleep-wakefulness, 180 control recordings on 15 chronically implanted cats were examined. In addition to a quantitative analysis, some aspects of the sleep-wakefulness architecture were considered, especially the nature and the distribution of the sleep phases that lead to paradoxical sleep (normal sequences) or to wakefulness (abortive sequences). Taken together, these features allow the definition of a 'control profile' which could be useful for the better characterization of drug effects.
3705977<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Effect of glutaurine on sleep-wakefulness cycle and aggressive behaviour in the cat.<<>>The effects of glutaurine (gamma-L-glutamyl taurine, Litoralon, Chinoin, Budapest) on the aggressive behaviour and sleep-wakefulness cycle were studied in freely moving cats. Glutaurine, even in doses as low as 0.1 microgram/kg, was found significantly to shorten the latency of the rat-killing reaction elicited by hypothalamic stimulation. On the other hand, the same doses failed to modify the sleep-wakefulness cycle to any significant degree throughout the study period of 4 hours. On the grounds of these and previous data, the possible brain site of the glutaurine action is discussed.
9164546<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Role of medial preoptic area beta adrenoceptors in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness.<<>>The role of the medial preoptic area (mPOA) beta adrenergic receptors in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness (S-W) was investigated in this study. S-W was assessed on the basis of polygraphic recording of EEG, EMG and EOG in free moving rats. Intracerebral microinjection of beta agonist, isoproterenol, into the mPOA produced arousal. The study was also conducted on another set of rats in which noradrenergic (NE) innervation to the mPOA was destroyed by injecting 6-hydroxydopamine into the ventral noradrenergic bundle, in the brain stem. Local application of isoproterenol, into the mPOA, in these animals, did not produce any significant change in S-W. Thus, the increase in awake period obtained on isoproterenol administration was the result of its action on the presynaptic NE terminals. Possible involvement of other responses in the isoproterenol induced increase in wakefulness, is discussed.
6716286<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Relationship between the three-hour-period sleep-wakefulness cycle and growth hormone secretion in the immature rat.<<>>The temporal pattern of growth hormone (GH) secretion throughout a day and its correlation with the sleep-wakefulness cycle in the 29-31-day-old female rat were studied by serial blood sampling through an intracardiac cannula at 10-min intervals. Electroencephalograms (e.e.g.s) recorded continuously during blood sampling periods were scored into wakefulness and sleep, and the amount of sleep for every 10 min was plotted against the GH value as assessed by radio-immunoassay. B analysis of the power spectrum using the least-squares method, the time series of GH concentration was found to have a periodicity of approximately 3.0 h in any of the 6-h periods sampled, beginning at 12.00, 18.00, 00.00 and 06.00 h, and in either sex. The peak time which was estimated for the time series of GH concentrations was found to occur consistently around 02.00-03.00, 05.00-06.00, 08.00-09.00, 11.00-12.00, 14.00-15.00, 17.00-18.00, 20.00-21.00 and 23.00-24.00 h in either the male or the female rat. The cross-correlation analysis performed between the time series of the amount of sleep and the GH concentration, which were obtained for the 6-h period from 12.00 to 18.00 h, revealed a significant positive correlation between the GH level and the amount of sleep during the preceding 10 min. The time series of the amount of sleep over a 24-h period from the data obtained in the continuous recording of e.e.g.s from 27 to 31 days of age revealed an ultradian rhythm with a periodicity of approximately 3.0 h. These findings indicate that the rat GH secretory rhythm with a 3.0-h periodicity develops by 30 days of age in both sexes, relating to the 3.0-h-period ultradian rhythm of the sleep-wakefulness cycle entrained by the light cycle.
19646496<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Electrophysiological effects of ghrelin on laterodorsal tegmental neurons in rats: an in vitro study.<<>>Ghrelin, a gut and brain peptide, is a potent stimulant for growth hormone (GH) secretion and feeding. Recent studies further show a critical role of ghrelin in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness. Laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT), that regulates waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, expresses GH secretagogue receptors (GHS-Rs). Thus, the present study was carried out to examine electrophysiological effects of ghrelin on LDT neurons using rat brainstem slices, and to determine the ionic mechanism involved. Whole cell recording revealed that ghrelin depolarizes LDT neurons dose-dependently in normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). The depolarization persisted in tetrodotoxin-containing ACSF (TTX ACSF), and is partially blocked by the application of [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6, a selective antagonist for GHS-Rs. Membrane resistance during the ghrelin-induced depolarization increased by about 18% than that before the depolarization. In addition, the ghrelin-induced depolarization was drastically reduced in high-K+ TTX ACSF with a K+ concentration of 13.25 mM. Reversal potentials obtained from I-V curves before and during the depolarization were about -83 mV, close to the equilibrium potential of the K+ channel. Most of the LDT neurons recorded were characterized by an A-current or both the A-current and a low threshold Ca2+ spike, and they were predominantly cholinergic. These results indicate that ghrelin depolarizes LDT neurons postsynaptically and dose-dependently via GHS-Rs, and that the ionic mechanisms underlying the ghrelin-induced depolarization include a decrease of K+ conductance. The results also suggest that LDT neurons are implicated in the cellular processes through which ghrelin participates in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness.
4088380<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[Dynamics of the neuronal activity of the amygdaloid complex of the rat brain in the sleep-wakefulness cycle].<<>>In freely moving rats the dynamics of neuronal activity of the amygdaloid complex was studied during the sleep-wakefulness cycle. It has been shown that the majority of neurons in the dorsomedial part of the complex discharge with high frequencies during active wakefulness (80%) and paradoxical sleep (66.7%) as compared with slow wave sleep. The neuronal activity of the basolateral part of the complex during the sleep-wakefulness cycle is more diverse: most of the neurons (84.6%) are activated during wakefulness, while only 38.4% of neurons are activated during parodoxical sleep. Some neurons show higher frequency during slow-wave sleep discharges. The above-mentioned findings show that the neuronal activity of the dorsomedial and basolateral amygdaloid complex differs in the sleep-wakefulness cycle. It is suggested that this complex must play an important role in the regulation of motivational processes, while it is not involved in the basic mechanisms of the sleep-wakefulness cycle.
7158034<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[Factor analysis of the mechanisms of the structure of sleep-wakefulness cycle].<<>>As a result of factor analysis of the structure of the cat sleep--wakefulness cycle, six factors have been defined, regarded as factors of "paradoxical sleep", "structure of slow-wave sleep", "transitions or delta-sleep", "sleep of medium depth", "stage of sleep spindles" and "delta sleep". Along with the detected certain independence of the apparatuses controlling individual sleep stages it was shown that mechanisms of paradoxical sleep may determine the organization of the entire sleep--wakefulness cycle, representing a peculiar system-forming factor. A considerable part in cessation of the fast sleep, as well as in the sleep general mechanisms is played by the apparatuses responsible for the transitional processes between the stages.
19003977<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Rapid alterations in cortical protein profiles underlie spontaneous sleep and wake bouts.<<>>Existing data indicate that sleep-wakefulness is an essential behavior. The biological function(s) of sleep, however, remains unknown, due, in part, to the lack of information available at the intracellular level. Preliminary microarray analyses show that changes in behavioral state influence regional mRNA profiles; however, the impact of sleep on protein signatures is virtually unexplored. In these studies, cortical protein profiles were examined after timed bouts of spontaneous sleep-wakefulness. Within minutes of each behavioral state examined, a small number of spots showing unique expression were detected. Mass spectroscopy analyses of sleep- and wake-related spots identified proteins associated with multiple functional categories. Two sleep-associated proteins were further validated using a sleep deprivation paradigm. We found preliminary evidence for two different post-transcriptional mechanisms-one (GAPDH) in which the amount of protein was increased in the recovery sleep following prolonged waking, while the other (actin) suggested that post-translational modifications may underlie sleep. The similarities between the effects of sleep on both protein and mRNA profiles indicate that dynamic intracellular changes underlie sleep-wake states and are consistent with roles for sleep in multiple biological functions.
166711<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Effect of chronic marijuana administration of stages of primate sleep-wakefulness.<<>>The effects of the repeated administration of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol on sleep-wakefulness patterns were studied in adult male squirrel monkeys. The percent time spent in slow wave sleep was reduced with chronic treatment and failed to return to base line levels after 30 days of recovery. The amount of time spent in Stage 1 or drowsy state increased with repeated treatment and remained elevated through recovery. Changes observed in other stages of sleep-wakefulness were sensitive to repeated treatment with marijuana but were found to return to base line levels during recovery.
2804326<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[Analysis of sleep-wakefulness structure in parkinsonian syndrome in rats induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,2,6-tetrahydropyridine and oxotremorine].<<>>The structure of the sleep-wakefulness cycle on the white rats with experimental parkinsonian syndrome was investigated, which was induced by administration of MPTP and oxotremorine. The EEG was recorded during 6 hours. The recordings were made 1.5 hours after the administration of the drugs. It was established that MPTP and oxotremorine broke the structure of the sleep-wakefulness cycle almost with complete reduction of paradoxal sleep and the decrease of SWS. The number of sleep spindles was reduced and changed the characteristics of the hippocampal theta rhythms. MPTP induces weakness of the phasic compound and strengthens the tonic compound.
9035530<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[Sleep-wakefulness rhythm disorders].<<>>The circadian system is synchronized on 24-hour by the light-dark synchronizer and by the social time cue. The circadian rhythm sleep disorders share a common underlying chronobiological basis. These disorders may be due to either jet-lag, shift-work or to lesions of the peripheral visual pathway. The delayed sleep phase syndrome, the advanced sleep phase syndrome, the non 24-hour syndrome as well as the irregular sleep-wake patterns are described. Therapeutic approaches, in particular with melatonin and (or) bright light, are presented.
6721913<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Ontogenesis of circadian sleep-wakefulness rhythms and developmental changes of sleep in the altricial rat and in the precocial guinea pig.<<>>Ontogenesis of circadian sleep-wakefulness rhythms and other developmental changes of sleep were examined in the altricial rat and in the precocial guinea pig. Circadian sleep-wakefulness rhythms began to emerge on the 4th-4.5th week after birth in rats born and raised not only under light-dark (LD) 12:12 h lighting schedule but also under a constant light condition. Only ultradian rhythms were recognized in the rat up to 2.5-3.5 weeks after birth. Unlike the rat, the guinea pig did not develop significant diurnal and circadian sleep rhythms during the course of its growth. Sleep-wakefulness rhythms of the 1-week-old infant guinea pig were very similar to those of the adult. During the development of the altricial rat the periods of slow wave sleep (SWS) and paradoxical sleep (PS) cycles, and the amounts of SWS per day increased. On the other hand, the amounts of PS per day and the length of the PS episodes decreased. For the guinea pig, however, these parameters of sleep were apparently constant throughout development.
2869168<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Effect of timiperone, a new antipsychotic drug, on the sleep-wakefulness cycle in cats.<<>>The effect of timiperone, a new antipsychotic drug, on the sleep-wakefulness cycle in cats was assessed by EEG, EMG and eye movement potential. Timiperone (0.03 to 0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently increased the slow wave sleep (SWS) time and decreased the paradoxical sleep (PS) time. Further, the onset of the first period of PS was delayed, and the number of PS phases tended to be decreased after the 0.3 mg/kg dose. These results suggest that the neurological control of the cerebral dopaminergic system might be at least in part attributable to the effect of timiperone on sleep mechanisms.
822856<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Effects of dihydrogenated ergot alkaloids on the sleep-wakefulness cycle and on brain biogenic amines in the rat.<<>>Investigations with four dihydrogenated ergot alkaloids, dihydroergotoxine, dihydroergonine, dihydroergostine and dihydro-beta-ergosine indicate that they exert similar dose dependent effects on the sleep-wakefulness cycle of the rat. The duration of wakefulness was increased, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and, in particular, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were shortened. 5-Hydroxytryptophan, but not apomorphine, induced similar changes of the rat sleep-wakefulness cycle. Neurochemical studies on rat brain biogenic amines indicate that dihydroergotoxine lowers homovanillic acid (HVA) levels and reduces HVA elevations after morphine or haloperidol in the striatum. In addition, the turnover of serotonin was slowed down and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) content in the whole brain was reduced. 5-HIAA elevation induced by clozapine was inhibited. These results suggest that the electroencephalographic changes in the rat produced by treatment with dihydrogenated ergot alkaloids reflect an enhanced level of vigilance and could be related to changes of brain biogenic amine metabolism.
15527748<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Substance P promotes sleep in the ventrolateral preoptic area of rats.<<>>Substance P (SP) has been characterized as an excitatory neurotransmitter and/or neuromodulator in the peripheral and central nervous systems. It is involved in mediating various biological functions such as smooth muscle contraction, neuronal excitation, and pain transmission. Although Lieb et al. reported that intravenous infusion of SP into healthy men led to an increase of paradoxical sleep latency and time awake, little is known about the function and target of SP on sleep-wakefulness cycle in the central nervous system. The ventrolateral preoptic area (vLPO) plays an important role in modulation of sleep-wakefulness cycle. The present study investigated the effect of SP on sleep-wakefulness cycle in the vLPO of rats. Slow wave sleep (SWS) was enhanced after SP was microinjected into bilateral vLPO, while SP receptor antagonist, N-acetyl-l-tryptophan 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-benzyl ester, led to the opposite effect. The effect induced by SP was blocked by U73122, a phospholipase C inhibitor. In addition, 3-mercaptopropionic acid, a glutamic acid decarboxylase inhibitor that inhibits gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis and release, blocked the SP-induced sleep-promoting effect in the vLPO. These results indicate that SP has sleep-promoting effect in the vLPO possibly by GABAergic neurons.
19118591<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Electrophysiological effects of ghrelin on pedunculopontine tegmental neurons in rats: An in vitro study.<<>>Ghrelin is a potent stimulant for growth hormone (GH) secretion and feeding. Recent studies further show a critical role of ghrelin in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness. Pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT), which regulates waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, expresses GH secretagogue receptors (GHS-Rs). Thus, the present study was carried out to examine electrophysiological effects of ghrelin on PPT neurons using rat brainstem slices, and to determine the ionic mechanism involved. Whole cell recording revealed that ghrelin depolarizes PPT neurons dose-dependently in normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). The depolarization persisted in tetrodotoxin-containing ACSF, although action potentials did not occur. Application of [d-Lys(3)]-GHRP-6, a selective antagonist for GHS-Rs, almost blocked the ghrelin-induced depolarization. Furthermore, the ghrelin-induced depolarization was reduced in high K(+) ACSF or low Na(+) ACSF, and abolished in high K(+)-low Na(+) ACSF or in a combination of low Na(+) ACSF and recordings with Cs(+)-containing pipettes. An inhibitor of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger had no effect on the depolarization. Most of the PPT neurons recorded were characterized by an A-current or both the A-current and a low threshold Ca(2+) spike, and they were predominantly cholinergic as revealed by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase staining. These results suggest that ghrelin depolarizes PPT neurons postsynaptically and dose-dependently via GHS-Rs, and that the ionic mechanisms underlying the ghrelin-induced depolarization include a decrease of K(+) conductance and an increase of non-selective cationic conductance. The results also support the notion that ghrelin plays a role in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness.
3013378<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Alpha adrenergic system in medial preoptic area involved in sleep-wakefulness in rats.<<>>The study is aimed at investigating the possible involvement of adrenergic mechanisms in the medial preoptic area (mPOA) for modulation of sleep-wakefulness in rats. In this study, saline, norepinephrine (NE), phenoxybenzamine (PBZ) and propranolol (PROP) were injected in the mPOA in different groups of male rats during the day and night. NE and PBZ were injected, during the day and the night respectively, in some control areas adjoining the mPOA in two other groups of animals. Arousal was produced by NE, and sleep by PBZ when they were applied in the mPOA. All other procedures, including application of NE and PBZ in the control areas and beta blocker (PROP) in the mPOA, did not produce alterations in sleep-wakefulness. These findings provide support for a physiological role played by the alpha adrenergic system in the mPOA for arousal, and area specificity of action of this system.
12700105<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Gene expression during sleep, wakefulness and sleep deprivation.<<>>Studies conducted on genes expression through the sleep-wake cycle and after sleep deprivation have revealed a number of genes that are more active during wakefulness/prolonged wakefulness than sleep, but also a few genes that are more active during sleep than wakefulness. Gene expression profiles during a specific vigilance state can be effectively monitored using microarrays, and when comparing profiles under different vigilance states, state-specific gene expression patterns can be precipitated. As such approach is random, and does not include any assumptions as to which genes would be expressed, it offers a non-biased view on the participation of different factors in the regulation of vigilance states. Combining results from different species offers a powerful tool for the analysis of genes that are involved in sleep-wake cycle regulation. The results of such assays are dependent on what area the tissue for the analysis is collected and the time point of the collection in respect to the duration of the specific vigilance state.
31041277<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>A study of comparing two cognitive-behavioral workshop for college students: Sleep, wakefulness program and perseverance program.<<>>Introduction and Aim: Researchers and specialists believe that health maintenance and improvement through university students, as a part of society, play a crucial role in community configuration which should not be ignored. Since there was a few studies in these fields, researchers have sought to explore how mentioned workshops is related to cognitive emotion regulation, anxiety, depression, and sleep quality for the student volunteers of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. Materials and Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, 152 students were allocated into the 3 equal groups (study1: "perseverance workshop" study2:"sleep and wakefulness workshop" and control group). Data collection instruments were the Granovsky cognitive emotion regulation scale, the Beck depression and anxiety inventories and Pittsburgh sleep Quality Index (PSQI-P) Questionnaire. Results: The results of comparing the anxiety and depression between groups showed that there was a decreasing and significant trend in the two intervention groups, before and after the two workshops (P < 0.001). For PSQ analysis, within-group comparisons in those who have participated sleep and wakefulness workshop showed that the change trend was significant and in linear form. In addition, to compare those who have participated in perseverance workshop with the control group, there was a significant difference between the pretest and posttest results in the Cognitive Emotion Regulation subgroups. Conclusion: It can be said that the implementation of the workshops could improve the emotional state of the participants in comparison to the control group.
19729003<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Protein expression is altered during spontaneous sleep in aged Sprague Dawley rats.<<>>Age-related changes in brain function include those affecting learning, memory, and sleep-wakefulness. Sleep-wakefulness is an essential behavior that results from the interaction of multiple brain regions, peptides, and neurotransmitters. The biological function(s) of sleep, however, remains unknown due to a paucity of information available at the cellular level. Aged rats exhibit alterations in the circadian and homeostatic influences associated with sleep-wake regulation. We recently showed that alterations in cortical profiles occur after timed bouts of spontaneous sleep in young rats. Examination of the cellular response to sleep-wake in old rats may thus provide insight(s) into the biological function(s) of sleep. To test this hypothesis, we monitored cortical profiles in the frontal cortex of young and old Sprague-Dawley rats after timed bouts of spontaneous sleep-wake behavior. Proteins were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), visualized by fluorescent staining, imaged, and analyzed as a function of behavioral state and age. Old rats showed a 6-fold increase in total protein expression, independent of the behavioral state at sacrifice. When analyzed according to age and behavioral state, there was a decrease (approximately 46%) in the number of phospho-spots present during SWS in aged animals. SWS-associated spots present only in old animals were associated with multiple functions including vesicular transport, cell signaling, oxidation state, cytoskeletal support, and energy metabolism. These data suggest that the intracellular response to the signaling associated with spontaneous sleep is affected by age and is consistent with the idea that the ability of sleep to fulfill its function(s) may become diminished with age.
3200415<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Dynamics of local blood flow in different regions of the hypothalamus in the sleep-wakefulness cycle.<<>>In chronic experiments on cats, using the recording of local blood flow in different regions of the hypothalamus in the sleep-wakefulness cycle, it was found that during paradoxical sleep, the level of local blood flow in the posterior hypothalamus increased significantly, while at the same time in the anterior hypothalamus and in the preoptic region a sharp reduction takes place in local blood flow. In deep slow wave sleep the opposite pattern is observed: the level of local blood flow increases in the anterior hypothalamus and in the preoptic region, and decreases in the posterior hypothalamus. The conclusion is drawn that in one and the same sleep phase the diverse directionality of the changes in the level of local blood flow in the different regions of the hypothalamus must be associated with functional shifts in these structures, and the functional state of each of them in different phases of the sleep-wakefulness cycle is evaluated on the basis of this.
19014076<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Assessment of sleep in ventilator-supported critically III patients.<<>>OBJECTIVES: In critically ill patients, sleep derangements are reported to be severe using Rechtschaffen and Kales (R&K) methodology; however, whether such methodology can reliably assess sleep during critical illness is unknown. We set out to determine the reproducibility of 4 different sleep-assessment methods (3 manual and 1 computer-based) for ventilator-supported critically ill patients and also to quantify the extent to which the reproducibility of the manual methods for measuring sleep differed between critically ill and ambulatory (control) patients. DESIGN: Observational methodologic study. SETTING: Academic center. PATIENTS: Critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation and age-matched controls underwent polysomnography. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Reproducibility for the computer-based method (spectral analysis of electroencephalography [EEG]) was better than that for the manual methods: R&K methodology and sleep-wakefulness organization pattern (P = 0.03). In critically ill patients, the proportion of misclassifications for measurements using spectral analysis, sleep-wakefulness organization pattern, and R&K methodology were 0%, 36%, and 53%, respectively (P < 0.0001). The EEG pattern of burst suppression was not observed. Interobserver and intraobserver reliability of the manual sleep-assessment methods for critically ill patients (kappa = 0.52 +/- 0.23) was worse than that for control patients (kappa = 0.89 +/- 0.13; P = 0.03). In critically ill patients, the overall reliability of the R&K methodology was relatively low for assessing sleep (kappa = 0.19), but detection of rapid eye movement sleep revealed good agreement (kappa = 0.70). CONCLUSIONS: Reproducibility for spectral analysis of EEG was better than that for the manual methods: R&K methodology and sleep-wakefulness organization pattern. For assessment of sleep in critically ill patients, the use of spectral analysis, sleep-wakefulness organization state, or rapid eye movement sleep alone may be preferred over the R&K methodology.
19801739<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Sleep-waking behavior following a lesion in the median preoptic nucleus in the rat.<<>>Hypnogenic structures are mainly located in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus. The number of Fos-immunoreactive neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic area (vlPOA) and in the median preoptic nucleus (MnPN) is positively correlated with the amount of preceding sleep. Majority of neurons recorded in these nuclei exhibit elevated discharge rates during sleep. Present study examined the effects of MnPN electrolytic lesion on the sleep-waking behavior in the rat. Experiments were performed on adult Mongrel albino male rats. Rats were implanted with EEG/EMG electrodes and with an electrode for MnPN lesion. Following a post-surgery recovery, rats were adapted to the recording environment, recorded for a baseline sleep-wakefulness cycle and then assigned to two groups. One group of rats was subjected to MnPN lesion and recorded for spontaneous sleep on the third, seventh and fourteenth days following the lesion procedure. Other rats served as a control group. The control and the MnPN-lesion rats exhibited different profiles of sleep-wakefulness organization. MnPN-lesion rats had significantly higher amounts of wakefulness and lower amounts of sleep, compared to control animals. Our findings support a view that the activity of a subset of MnPN neurons is strongly related to sleep regulation.
19995590<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>African trypanosome infections of the nervous system: parasite entry and effects on sleep and synaptic functions.<<>>The extracellular parasite Trypanosoma brucei causes human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness. Trypanosomes are transmitted by tsetse flies and HAT occurs in foci in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease, which is invariably lethal if untreated, evolves in a first hemo-lymphatic stage, progressing to a second meningo-encephalitic stage when the parasites cross the blood-brain barrier. At first, trypanosomes are restricted to circumventricular organs and choroid plexus in the brain outside the blood-brain barrier, and to dorsal root ganglia. Later, parasites cross the blood-brain barrier at post-capillary venules, through a multi-step process similar to that of lymphocytes. Accumulation of parasites in the brain is regulated by cytokines and chemokines. Trypanosomes can alter neuronal function and the most prominent manifestation is represented by sleep alterations. These are characterized, in HAT and experimental rodent infections, by disruption of the sleep-wake 24h cycle and internal sleep structure. Trypanosome infections alter also some, but not all, other endogenous biological rhythms. A number of neural pathways and molecules may be involved in such effects. Trypanosomes secrete prostaglandins including the somnogenic PGD2, and they interact with the host's immune system to cause release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. From the sites of early localization of parasites in the brain and meninges, such molecules could affect adjacent brain areas implicated in sleep-wakefulness regulation, including the suprachiasmatic nucleus and its downstream targets, to cause the changes characteristic of the disease. This raises challenging issues on the effects of cytokines on synaptic functions potentially involved in sleep-wakefulness alterations.
15773329<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[Sleep disturbance in patients with developmental disability].<<>>Many patients with developmental disabilities exhibit various types of sleep disturbance. However, we have no idea of a specific approach to relieve the symptoms on sleep disturbance, although recent basic neuroscience has provided many novel findings on the neuronal mechanisms of the sleep-wakefulness cycle. In this brief review, a flip-flop circuit was introduced to explain neuronal mechanisms of the abrupt change between sleep and wakefulness. The rate of atonia during non-REM sleep was also introduced, as this index may useful for assessing the cholinoaminergic balance of the central nervous system. Sleep hygiene was also based on basic sleep-wakefulness mechanisms. To maintain sleep hygiene is a fundamental approach caring for patients with sleep disturbance, and specific approaches such as medication and treatment of sleep disordered breathing should also be based on the basic mechanisms of the sleep-wakefulness cycle. It was emphasized that effective intervention should only occur after the careful assessment of neuronal background of each patient.
166716<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>The actions of dihydroxyphenylalanine and dihydroxyphenylserine on the sleep-wakefulness cycle of the rat after peripheral decarboxylase inhibition.<<>>1. The actions of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and dihydroxyphenylserine (DOPS) were assessed on the sleep-wakefulness cycle of male Wistar rats. 2. In comparative studies the extracerebral decarboxylase was inhibited with serinetrihydroxybenzylhydrazide (RO 4-4602) before injection of DOPA or DOPS. 3. DOPA (80-160 mg/kg, i.p.) with or without previous inhibition of the peripheral decarboxylase gave rise to an initial significant increase of slow wave activity, which may be related to a release of 5-hydroxytryptamine. 4. During the subsequent 8 h sessions, DOPA significantly decreased slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep (REM) and increased wakefulness. 5. DOPS (80-160 mg/kg, i.p.) did not significantly modify the sleep-wakefulness cycle apart from a decrease of the latency for the first REM episode after 160 mg/kg in the RO 4-4602 pretreated animals.
10202759<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[Molecular and neuroanatomical mechanisms of sleep-wakefulness regulation by prostaglandins D2 and E2].<<>>Prostaglandin (PG) s D2 and E2 are the major arachidonic acid metabolites in the mammalian brain. PGD synthase, the enzyme that produces PGD2 in the brain, is mainly localized in the arachnoid membrane and choroid plexus. It is secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid and circulates in the brain through the ventricular system. PGD2 induces sleep by acting on the surface of the ventro-medial region of the rostral basal forebrain, the signal of which is probably transmitted into the brain parenchyma by adenosine via adenosine A2a receptors. Fos expression experiments suggest that PGD2 inhibits histaminergic arousal neurons of the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) in the posterior hypothalamus by activating inhibitory neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO). However, PGE2 causes wakefulness by activating arousal neurons in the TMN via AMPA type excitatory amino acid receptors. Therefore, PGD2, acting as a sleep-inducer, and PGE2, acting as a wakefulness-promoter, jointly regulate the generation of sleep and wakefulness in the mammalian brain.
1618653<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Acute effects of ozone on EEG activity, sleep-wakefulness and heart rate in rats.<<>>Effects of exposure to O3 on EEG activity, sleep-wakefulness and heart rate were examined using conscious rats which had been chronically implanted with electrodes for EEG, EMG and ECG recordings. Exposure to 0.5 ppm O3 for 6 hrs and 1.0 ppm O3 for 3 hrs suppressed amounts of wakefulness (W) and paradoxical sleep (PS) at the expense of an increase in slow-wave sleep (SWS), and lowered the amplitude of fast EEG waves and heart rate (HR). The lowered EEG amplitude and the suppressed PS recovered more rapidly during the post-exposure period than did the lowered HR. The ip administration of atropine sulfate blocked the suppressed W, the increased SWS and the lowered HR, while the lowered EEG amplitude and the suppressed PS were not blocked. These observations suggest that the O3-induced bradycardia results from enhanced activity of cardiac parasympathetic nerves and that the O3-induced changes in W and SWS result secondarily from some circulatory factor including the bradycardia.
10459664<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Acetylcholine and glutamate release during sleep-wakefulness in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus and norepinephrine changes regulated by nitric oxide.<<>>Cholinergic neurons in the pons appear to play a major role in generating rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In the present study, acetylcholine and glutamate release in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT) during the sleep-waking cycle were investigated by in vivo microdialysis. Acetylcholine release during slow wave sleep (SWS) was significantly lower (P<0.05) than during REM sleep and wakefulness. On the other hand, glutamate release during wakefulness was higher (P<0.05) than during REM sleep and SWS. Furthermore, the application of N-methyl-D-aspartate (1 mM) induced a significant increase of nitric oxides (NOx) for 20 min (P<0.05) and a decrease of norepinephrine for the first 15 min (P=0.01), indicating NOx regulation on norepinephrine release in PPT.
17461022<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[Role of cholinergic mechanisms of the ventrolateral preoptico-anterior hypothalamic area in regulation of sleep and wakefulness states in pigeons].<<>>Maintenance of wakefulness is established to accomplish muscarinic (M-) cholinergic receptor activation in the ventrolateral preoptic area of the hypothalamus. The "muscarinic" wakefulness is characterized by enhancement of electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectra in the 0.75-12 Hz band and by increase in brain temperature. Activation of nicotinic (N-) cholinergic receptors of the area produces an increase in the duration of slow wave sleep, EEG power spectra reduction in the 0.75-7 Hz band, a decrease in brain temperature. And its hyperactivation leads to wakefulness, during its episodes the brain temperature decreases. During M- and N-cholinergic receptor blockade, the sleep-wakefulness and thermoregulation changes opposite to their activation were found. It is suggested that M- and N-cholinergic receptors of the ventrolateral preoptic area in pigeons participate in the sleep-wakefulness regulation and this effect is related to influence of this area on GABA-ergic system.
2012981<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Medial preoptic area affects sleep-wakefulness independent of associated body temperature change in free moving rats.<<>>Sleep-wakefulness and body temperature may modulate each other. Though both the functions are influenced by the medial preoptic area, the mechanism of action was not clear. This study was aimed at finding out whether the tonic influence of the medial preoptic area on sleep-wakefulness was independent of or secondary to simultaneous change in body temperature. The effects of inactivation of the area by a long acting local anaesthetic, marcain, on those physiological functions were investigated during the night and the day in freely moving rats. Though medial preoptic area influenced sleep-wakefulness and body temperature simultaneously, the effect on the latter was prolonged. The results suggest that the influence on sleep-wakefulness is unlikely to be associated with simultaneously changing body temperature. However, this study fails to differentiate whether the observed effects were due to inactivation of the cell body or the fibers passing through the area.
1332801<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Different types of norepinephrinergic receptors are involved in preoptic area mediated independent modulation of sleep-wakefulness and body temperature.<<>>The preoptic area is known to regulate sleep-wakefulness and body temperature. It was suggested earlier that though sleep-wakefulness and body temperature may affect each other, the preoptic area mediated influence on those two physiological phenomena is likely to be independent of alteration in each other. Since intrapreoptic area norepinephrine could modulate both those functions, study of that system was undertaken. It was hypothesized that since the preoptic area has different types of norepinephrinergic receptors (viz. alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta), independent modulation of those two functions was probably due to activation or inactivation of separate receptors. Hence, the effects of different agonist and antagonist of those receptors individually as well as in combination into the preoptic area were studied on those two functions in freely moving rats. The results suggest that norepinephrine induced preoptic area mediated influence on the body temperature is primarily regulated by the alpha 1 receptors while the sleep and wakefulness are regulated by alpha 2 and beta receptors, respectively. The finding should help in explaining several poorly understood observations reported earlier and it suggests that similar phenomena may possibly exist in other system involving other neurotransmitters as well.
20063783<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[Evolutionary aspects of sleep and stress interaction: phylo-, ontogenetic approach].<<>>This work deals the comparative behavioral, somatosensor and neurophysiological characteristics of these forms of passive defensive behavior included in amphibian's sleep-wakefulness cycle and their developmental dynamics in the ascending vertebrates secale. Sleep formation in early postnatal ontogenesis of mature- and immature-born mammals - from undifferent sleep to the mature sleep divided into two phases as well as stress formation are considered in parallel. Comparative phylo-, and ontogenetic analysis of several aspects of stress-reactions, sleep, and immobility phenomenon of cataleptic type allows concluding that amphibians and reptilians catalepsy can be interpreted as preadaptive from of behavior underlying in the stress of homoeothermic animals. Another word, the cataleptic state can be considered as the homologic state of stress-reaction. Catalepsy is the genetically programmed state of poykilothermic animals characterized by comparatively high alertness of animal, its freezing in immobile but active posture with a possibility of fast exit into waking state and alongside with other somatosensor and neurophysiological characteristics determines the entire subsequent complex of evolutionary morphofunctional, neurophysiological and hormonal changes in nomoyptherms. This in many aspects unspecific behavioral adaptive reaction in poykilotherms is realized on the corresponding hormonal and neurophysiological levels of development and promotes to fast mobilization and stabilization their homeostasis. At the higher evolutionary scale after development of most brain neurotransmitter and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal systems the leading role in stress regulation begins to be predominent the hormonal reaction. Only in the alertness phase of stress-reaction the elements of activation of extrapyramidal regulatory system of locomotion are observed. This is manifested by the cateleptic immobility. Thus the stress as the general adaptational syndrome reflects the evolutionary regularities of development of specific functions supporting the total homeostasis. The scheme of evolution of sleep-wakefulness cycle in vertebrates is presented; according to it, the immobility state of cataleptic type on one hand may to considered as a part of wakefulness providing mainly specific elements of stress-reaction, while on other hand it is a certain step of inhibitory processes in CNS for subsequent involvement of sleep-regulatory systems for the compensation and maintenance of recovery reactions.
1523277<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Effects of ritanserin and chlordiazepoxide on sleep-wakefulness alterations in rats following chronic cocaine treatment.<<>>The effects of ritanserin, a 5-hydroxytryptamine-2 (5-HT2) receptor antagonist, and chlordiazepoxide, a benzodiazepine agonist, on sleep-wakefulness disturbances in rats after acute administration of cocaine and after discontinuation of chronic cocaine treatment were examined. Intraperitoneal (IP) injection of chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg) but not ritanserin (0.63 mg/kg) prevented the increase of wakefulness (W) and the reduction of light slow wave sleep (SWS1) and deep slow wave sleep (SWS2) induced by an acute injection of cocaine (20 mg/kg IP). Daily injection of cocaine (20 mg/kg for 5 days, then 30 mg/kg for 5 days IP) at the onset of the light phase elicited an increase of W and a concomitant decrease of SWS1, SWS2 and paradoxical sleep (PS) in the light phase, followed by a rebound in SWS2 and PS in the subsequent dark phase. Following cocaine discontinuation, the circadian distribution of sleep-wakefulness states remained disturbed in saline-treated rats for at least 5 days. Both ritanserin (0.63 mg/kg IP/day) and chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg IP/day) reduced the alteration in the distribution of W and SWS2 throughout the light-dark cycle from the first day of administration on, but failed to prevent PS alterations. The mechanisms by which both compounds exert their effect are probably quite different. For chlordiazepoxide sedative and sleep-inducing properties probably play a major role. In contrast, for ritanserin SWS2-increasing properties and its ability to reverse preference for drugs of abuse without inducing aversion might be key factors.
22674352<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Psychosis in Parkinson's disease without dementia: common and comorbid with other non-motor symptoms.<<>>Psychosis in Parkinson's disease (PD) is common and associated with a range of negative outcomes. Dementia and psychosis are highly correlated in PD, but the frequency and correlates of psychosis in patients without cognitive impairment are not well understood. One hundred and ninety-one non-demented PD patients at two movement disorders centers participated in a study of neuropsychiatric complications in PD and completed a detailed neurological and neuropsychiatric assessment, including the rater-administered Parkinson Psychosis Rating Scale for hallucinations, delusions, and minor symptoms of psychosis (illusions and misidentification of persons). Psychotic symptoms were present in 21.5% of the sample. Visual hallucinations were most common (13.6%), followed by auditory hallucinations (6.8%), illusions or misidentification of people (7.3%), and paranoid ideation (4.7%). Visual hallucinations and illusions or misidentification of people were the most common comorbid symptoms (3.1%). Depression (P = 0.01) and rapid eye movement behavior disorder symptoms (P = 0.03) were associated with psychosis in a multivariable model. The odds of experiencing psychotic symptoms were approximately five times higher in patients with comorbid disorders of depression and sleep-wakefulness. Even in patients without global cognitive impairment, psychosis in PD is common and most highly correlated with other non-motor symptoms. Screening for psychosis should occur at all stages of PD as part of a broad non-motor assessment. In addition, these findings suggest a common neural substrate for disturbances of perception, mood, sleep-wakefulness, and incipient cognitive decline in PD.
7215813<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Effects of repeated administrations of dihydroergotoxine (Redergine) on the sleep-wakefulness cycle in the cat.<<>>Investigations with dihydroergotoxine methane sulfonate (DHET, the active substance of Redergine) indicate that DHET acts on the sleep-wakefulness cycle of the cat by increasing wakefulness and slow-wave sleep and decreasing rapid eye movement sleep. DHET was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg for 5 successive days. The effects were fairly stable, although with a tendency to diminish with time. Such alterations in the sleep-wakefulness cycle are discussed as possible indices of the beneficial effects seen in elderly patients treated with DHET.
11566148<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>GABA-A receptors in mPOAH simultaneously regulate sleep and body temperature in freely moving rats.<<>>Sleep-wakefulness and body temperature are two circadian rhythmic biological phenomena. The role of GABAergic inputs in the medial preoptico-anterior hypothalamus (mPOAH) on simultaneous regulation of those phenomena was investigated in freely moving normally behaving rats. The GABA-A receptors were blocked by microinjecting picrotoxin, and the effects on electrophysiological parameters signifying sleep-wakefulness, rectal temperature and brain temperature were recorded simultaneously. The results suggest that, normally, GABA in the medial preoptic area acts through GABA-A receptor that induces sleep and prevents an excessive rise in body temperature. However, the results do not allow us to comment on the cause and effect relationship, if any, between changes in sleep-wakefulness and body temperature. The changes in brain and rectal temperatures showed a positive correlation, however, the former varied within a narrower range than that of the latter.
12162531<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Amino acid release from the rat oral pontine reticular nucleus across the sleep-wakefulness cycle.<<>>To elucidate a functional involvement of amino acids in the regulation of vigilance states, we investigated time-course changes of glycine (Gly), glutamate (Glu), and glutamine (Gln) in the extracellular fluid of the oral pontine reticular nucleus (PnO) in freely behaving rats by an in vivo microdialysis technique. The average concentration of Gly in dialysates collected during rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) was significantly higher than that collected during wakefulness (W) and non rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) under perfusion with normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). These state-dependent changes in Gly, however, failed to occur when the PnO was perfused with Ca2+-free aCSF. In contrast, the average concentration of neither Glu nor Gln exhibited state dependency under the perfusion with normal or Ca2+-free aCSF; however, the concentrations of all three amino acids showed no consistent time-sequential changes specifically in the first three minutes from the beginning of each vigilance state. Although it is suggested that in the PnO the average concentration of Gly was higher during REMS than during NREMS and W by a Ca2+-dependent mechanism, however, time-course changes in the amino acids are complicated and other mechanisms may also be influential.
7395195<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Some aspects of the polygraphic studies on sleep-wakefulness cycle in rat.<<>>The various phases characterizing the sleep-wakefulness cycle were studied in rats. Electroencephalographic and electromyographic results were both analysed using classical visual methods and more sophisticated techniques such as spectral analysis and Hjorth parameters. The latter approach was very useful in obtaining a rapid characterization of regional and general brain activity and is applicable to the study of the EEG and EMG profiles of different pharmacological agents. Together with the conventional studies on the sleep-wakefulness cycle, the methodology reported here gives a powerful battery for the study of new centrally acting drugs.
9503827<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[Nitric oxide as a regulatory factor in sleep-wakefulness mechanisms].<<>>Although several roles of neuronal nitric oxide (NO) have been suggested, the capacity of NO on sleep-wakefulness mechanisms is open to discussion. We examined the effects of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors on rat sleep using a microdialysis technique. When NOS inhibitor L-NAME was administrated at the central region of diencephalon, paradoxical sleep (PS) significantly increased coinciding with decrease of wakefulness in the dose-dependent manner. The effect of L-NAME on PS was completely reversed by L-arginine. Additionally, administration of NO donor NOC 18 at the action site of L-NAME completely inhibited sleep. Our results suggest that NO could play a role in the continuation of vigilance around the midline thalamic nuclei.
1910566<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Morphine effects in brainstem-transected cats: I. EEG and 'sleep-wakefulness' in the isolated forebrain.<<>>In order to examine the prosencephalic mechanisms that might sustain the effects of opiates on EEG and sleep-wakefulness, the actions of morphine sulfate on the EEG and the pupil size were examined in the chronically isolated forebrain of brainstem-transected cats. Single morphine doses (0.5, 2.0 or 3.0 mg/kg, i.p.) administered to these animals produced a long-lasting EEG desynchronization in the isolated forebrain which was associated with pupil mydriasis. The specificity of these morphine effects was shown by the fact that naloxone blocks both the EEG and pupillary effects of the drug. After morphine, spontaneous synchronized EEG with delta waves normally seen in the isolated forebrain preparation was suppressed for 6-18 h, followed by a strong rebound. Both the suppression and rebound in synchronization with delta waves occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The duration of these effects closely paralleled previously reported morphine effects on non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in intact cats. Therefore, in relation to the effects of morphine on EEG and sleep-wakefulness in intact animals, this study suggests that: (1) Morphine suppression of NREM sleep and the subsequent arousal state of the animal are mediated by prosencephalic structures; (2) the generation of the typical neocortical EEG slow burst activity produced by opiates depends on lower brainstem structures.
3356265<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[Dynamics of unit activity of the gigantocellular tegmental field in the sleep-wakefulness cycle of rats].<<>>Computer analysis and statistical processing of the unit activity showed that the majority of neurons (65.2%) in the gigantocellular tegmental field were discharging with high frequency during active wakefulness and paradoxical sleep as compared to slow-wave sleep in unrestrained rats. 11.6% of the neurons revealed an inverse pattern of activity: they discharged more intensively during slow-wave sleep, their firing rate decreasing during active wakefulness and paradoxical sleep. Some neurons (23.2%) were found which fired intensively during active wakefulness, their firing rate decreasing both in slow-wave and paradoxical sleep. Involvement of the gigantocellular tegmental field in the neurophysiological mechanisms of phases and stages of the sleep-wakefulness cycle is discussed.
6661621<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Total calorimetric measurements in the rat: influences of the sleep-wakefulness cycle and of the environmental temperature.<<>>Rates of production as well as dry and evaporative heat loss during the sleep-wakefulness cycle were studied in 11 male, adult albino rats with chronically implanted electrodes and thermocouple re-entrant tubes. Two groups of animals chronically acclimated to 6 or 23 degrees C were acutely studied at 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C. Statistical analysis of the data shows that rates of heat production and dry heat loss differ with respect to acclimation and acute environmental temperatures, and show significant differences depending on the states of the sleep-wakefulness cycle. Rate of heat production was highest during wakefulness, intermediate during synchronized sleep and lowest during paradoxical sleep. Rate of dry heat loss of 15 degrees C was maximal during paradoxical sleep. Rate of evaporative heat loss apparently did not change with the states of the sleep-wakefulness cycle. Heat storage estimated from difference in rates of heat production and heat loss was positive during wakefulness, slightly negative during synchronized sleep and markedly negative during paradoxical sleep. The data presented suggest a clear although partial suppression of thermoregulatory mechanisms during paradoxical sleep in the white rat.
17976600<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Subchronic 17alpha-ethinyl estradiol differentially affects subtypes of sleep and wakefulness in ovariectomized rats.<<>>In ovariectomized (OVX) Sprague-Dawley rats, estradiol benzoate (EB) has been reported to decrease rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep during the dark phase for up to 3 days. It is unknown, however, if estrogenic effects on sleep extend beyond 3 days or if other estrogens could induce the same changes. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the increased wakefulness in the dark phase was due to changes in active or quiet wakefulness. Therefore, we examined the effects of daily injections of 17alpha-ethinyl estradiol (EE) for 6 days on sleep and wakefulness in the OVX rat. After 3 days of baseline recording using a telemetric system, rats were administered sesame oil (sc) for 3 days followed by injection with EE (20 mug/rat/day, sc) for 6 days. After treatment, sleep was recorded during hormone withdrawal for an additional 5 days. A few sporadic but statistically significant increases in light phase sleep occurred during the last 3 days of EE treatment. Starting on day 2 of the study, EE caused statistically significant decreases in dark phase REM sleep that were maintained throughout the treatment period and persisted until the 3rd day of hormone withdrawal. During the dark phase, statistically significant decreases in NREM sleep and increases in active wakefulness started on the second day of treatment and abated by the end of treatment. This study demonstrated that EE had similar effects on sleep-wakefulness to EB and demonstrates the utility of telemetric polysomnographic recording of the female OVX rat as a model for understanding the estrogen-induced changes on sleep-wakefulness.
21786643<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[Neurophysiological, neurochemical, autonomous and chronobiological basics of sleep medicine].<<>>The review discusses various mechanisms of the rapidly growing problem of Sleep Medicine. The "Sleep-wakefulness" cycle is a continuum of different functional states and the diseases that these states might prompt to manifest themselves in various ways. In these cases, we must say that change produces the conditions of disease manifestation rather than the disease itself. The paper describes the dynamics of the autonomous parameters during sleep, emphasizes the role and importance of chronobiological aspects of the "sleep-wakefulness" cycle. The holographic principle of the operation I sleep cycle is described which persists even in the cerebral stroke. From the standpoint of neurochemistry, modern hypnotics and drugs of the nearest future can be divided into 2 groups: proS (pro sleep)--for sleeping, and antiW (anti-wakefulness)--vs. wakefulness.
10375707<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>In vivo microdialysis measures of extracellular serotonin in the rat hippocampus during sleep-wakefulness.<<>>We investigated extracellular 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in rat hippocampus during different stages of the sleep-waking cycle using in vivo microdialysis. The extracellular 5-HT level was highest in active waking (AW) and, when compared to AW, 5-HT level was progressively lower in quiet waking (QW; 78%), quiet sleep (QS; 50%) and REM (which we termed active sleep (AS); 40%). Functional implications of AS related-decreased 5-HT in the hippocampus are discussed.
22828639<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Muscarinic M4 receptors regulate GABAergic transmission in rat tuberomammillary nucleus neurons.<<>>Histaminergic neurons within the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) play an important role in sleep-wakefulness regulation. Here, we report the muscarinic modulation of GABAergic spontaneous miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in mechanically dissociated rat histaminergic neurons using a conventional whole-cell patch clamp technique. Muscarine, a nonselective muscarinic acetylcholine (mACh) receptor agonist, reversibly decreased mIPSC frequency without affecting the current amplitude, indicating that muscarine acts presynaptically to decrease the probability of spontaneous GABA release. The muscarine action on GABAergic mIPSC frequency was completely blocked by atropine, a nonselective mACh receptor antagonist, and tropicamide, an M(4) receptor antagonist. The muscarine-induced decrease in mIPSC frequency was completely occluded in the presence of Cd(2+), a general voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel blocker, or in a Ca(2+)-free external solution. However, pharmacological agents affecting adenylyl cyclase or G-protein coupled inwardly rectifying K(+) channel activity did not prevent the inhibitory action of muscarine on GABAergic mIPSCs. These results suggest that muscarine acts on M(4) receptors on GABAergic nerve terminals projecting to histaminergic neurons to inhibit spontaneous GABA release via the inhibition of Ca(2+) influx from the extracellular space. Muscarine also inhibited action potential-dependent GABA release by activating presynaptic M(4) receptors in more physiological conditions. The M(4) receptor-mediated modulation of GABAergic transmission onto TMN neurons may contribute to the regulation of sleep-wakefulness.
6140665<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Drug effects on sleep-wakefulness patterns in dogs.<<>>Sleep-wakefulness patterns in dogs were studied using computerized on-line analysis and off-line sleep stage classification. A short description of the methods is given and the results of the analysis are discussed, touching on the problem of similarities and dissimilarities with sleep-wakefulness patterns in cats. Examples are given of species differences with respect to the effects of narcotic analgesics. The predictability of results obtained in the dog with respect to humans is discussed using as an example the sedative effects of antihistamines and the absence of such effects in response to a specific H1-antagonist, astemizole. The role of neurotransmitters in sleep is studied, especially the role of dopamine by using dopamine antagonists (pimozide, domperidone) and dopamine agonists (apomorphine).
24635644<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Sleep-wake fluctuations and respiratory events during Cheyne-Stokes respiration in patients with heart failure.<<>>Fluctuations in sleep-wake state are thought to contribute to the respiratory instability of Cheyne-Stokes respiration in patients with heart failure by promoting the rhythmic occurrence of central apnea and ventilatory overshoot. There are no data, however, on the relationship between vigilance state and respiratory events. In this study we used a novel method to detect the occurrence of state transitions (time resolution: 0.25 s, minimum duration of state changes: 2 s) and to assess their time relationship with apnoeic events. We also evaluated whether end-apnoeic arousals are associated with a ventilatory overshoot. A polysomnographic, daytime laboratory recording (25 min) was performed during Cheyne-Stokes respiration in 16 patients with heart failure. Automatic state classification included wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement sleep stages 1-2. As a rule, wakefulness occurred during hyperpnoeic phases, and non-rapid eye movement sleep occurred during apnoeic events. Ninety-two percent of the observed central apneas (N = 272) were associated with a concurrent wakefulness --> non-rapid eye movement sleep --> wakefulness transition. The delay between wakefulness --> non-rapid eye movement sleep transitions and apnea onset was -0.3 [-3.1, 3.0] s [median (lower quartile, upper quartile); P = 0.99 testing the null hypothesis: median delay = 0], and the delay between non-rapid eye movement sleep --> wakefulness transitions and apnea termination was 0.2 [-0.5, 1.2] s (P = 0.7). A positive/negative delay indicates that the state transition occurred before/after the onset or termination of apnea. Non-rapid eye movement sleep --> wakefulness transitions synchronous with apnea termination were associated with a threefold increase in tidal volume and a twofold increase in ventilation (all P < 0.001), indicating ventilatory overshoot. These findings highlight that wakefulness --> non-rapid eye movement sleep --> wakefulness transitions parallel apnoeic events during Cheyne-Stokes respiration in patients with heart failure. The relationships between state changes and respiratory events are consistent with the notion that state fluctuations promote ventilatory instability.
8202058<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[Anatomic-functional relationships between the motor systems and the sleep-wakefulness systems].<<>>The present paper deals with relationships between neural systems which control motor behaviour (pyramidal and extrapyramidal) and sleep-wakefulness states (in particular the reticular formation). We examined successively their anatomical and neurochemical substrates, electrophysiological and functional motor alterations depending on ascending and descending influences from brain stem during the sleep-wakefulness cycle. These data suggest that sleep-wake states result from the modulation of excitability in neuronal pools and that each state results from the co-ordinated working of several functionally different neuronal pools. Thus, each state could be understood as a sum of behavioural events depending on a neural network. We hypothesized that abnormal motor events occurring specifically during a sleep state could result from motor structures abnormally recruited in neural networks specifically involved in this sleep state.
23997373<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Influence of inhibitory serotonergic inputs to orexin/hypocretin neurons on the diurnal rhythm of sleep and wakefulness.<<>>STUDY OBJECTIVE: Serotonergic (5HT) neurons of the dorsal raphe nuclei receive excitatory input from hypothalamic orexin (hypocretin) neurons and reciprocally inhibit orexin neurons through the 5HT1A receptor. However, the physiological significance of this negative feedback circuit for sleep/wakefulness regulation is little understood. DESIGN: 5HT1A receptor expression level was specifically and reversibly controlled in the orexin neurons using the Tet-off system. The responsiveness of orexin neurons to 5HT in vitro and the sleep/wakefulness patterns were compared between 5HT1A-overexpressing and control mice. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: When the 5HT1A receptor was overexpressed in orexin neurons of Orexin-EGFP; orexin-tTA; TetO Htr1a mice, 5HT-induced inhibition of orexin neurons was prolonged. In the absence of doxycycline, Orexin-tTA; TetO Htr1a mice exhibited severe fragmentation of sleep/wakefulness during the first half of the dark period-the time of maximal activity in nocturnal rodents-without affecting sleep/wakefulness during the light period when sleep time is maximal. However, when the 5HT1A receptor in orexin neurons was reduced to basal expression levels in the presence of doxycycline, sleep/wakefulness patterns in Orexin-tTA; TetO Htr1a mice during the early active period were indistinguishable from those of littermate TetO Htr1a mice. These results strongly suggest that enhancement of inhibitory serotonergic input to orexin neurons caused fragmentation of wakefulness. In contrast, sleep/wakefulness architecture in the light period was unaffected by 5HT1A receptor overexpression in the orexin neurons. CONCLUSION: Inhibitory serotonergic input likely functions as negative feedback to orexin neurons in the early dark period and helps stabilize wakefulness bouts, thereby contributing to the diurnal rhythm of sleep and wakefulness.
6828153<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Neuronal correlates of sleep, wakefulness and arousal in a diurnal insect.<<>>The discovery that various states of sleep, rest, wakefulness and arousal in man can be correlated with specific forms of the electroencephalogram1 has led to intensive studies of these states, mostly in mammals2-5. Today it is generally accepted that circadian sleep-wakefulness cycles occur in mammals and birds2,3,6. Behavioural observations on sleep in moths have also been published7; many other invertebrates demonstrate rest/activity cycles8. Circadian sensitivity fluctuations in both central9 and peripheral10-15 components of the visual system of various nocturnal arthropod species have been demonstrated. We now report that long-term, extracellular, single-unit recordings from optomotor interneurones in the optic lobes of forager honey bees reveal an oscillation in their sensitivity to moving visual stimuli16, 17. The oscillation displays properties typical of a circadian rhythm6, 18. The sensitivity of the neurons is higher during the subjective day than during the subjective night. The locomotor activity of individual, fixed walking forager bees shows a similar circadian oscillation and is also higher during the subjective day. Visual and mechanical stimuli can act directly on the interneurones and restore their sensitivity during times of reduced neuronal responsiveness. A comparison with results available for mammals makes it likely that the neuronal phenomena presented here are correlates of the bee's circadian sleep-wakefulness rhythm.
2439293<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Neuronal firing in the pallidal region: firing patterns during sleep-wakefulness cycle in cats.<<>>Neuronal activity was investigated by extracellular microelectrodes in the pallidal region of freely moving cats during wakefulness (W), slow-wave sleep (SWS) and paradoxical sleep (PS). The firing of 150 units from 35 points was examined. On the basis of the modifications of firing rates and patterns during the sleep-wakefulness cycle, 5 groups of neurons were distinguished. Two of these groups were characterized by strong increase of firing rate in W and PS and in one of them this increase preceded the cortical activation at the SWS-PS transition by an average of 26 sec. The role played by the basal forebrain area in the regulation of the sleep-wakefulness cycle is discussed.
7652596<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[Regulatory effect of ventral tegmental area on sleep-wakefulness in rats].<<>>Experiments were performed on 31 male SD rats. The results were as follows: (1) The time of waking was increased during the second and third hours after microinjection of 3.3 and 6.6 nmol bromocriptine into bilateral VTA (P < 0.01), but the 1.33 nmol group was without significant effect. (2) The time of waking was decreased during the second and third hours after microinjection of 2 and 4 nmol SCH23390 into VTA (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05 respectively), while 3.4 nmol sulpiride group was without effect. (3) One week after administration of kainic acid (0.3 microgram), the rats presented less time of waking in the day (P < 0.05), while sleep-wakefulness cycle at night showed no change. The results suggest that bromocriptine could increase wakefulness by activating VTA DA neurons via D1 receptor and that the DA neurons might exert a tonic effect for maintaining the wakefulness at the daytime.
9844853<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Centralis superior raphe, reticularis pontis nuclei, and sleep-wakefulness cycle in cats.<<>>This study examines the influence of lesions in the centralis superior raphe nucleus (CeSR) and adjacent paramedial pontine tegmentum on the sleep/wakefulness cycle (SWC) in cats. Sixteen cats had electrodes implanted for electro-oculogram (EOG), electromyogram (EMG), electroencephalogram (EEG) and ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) recordings. There were 10 experimental animals: seven animals received diathermocoagulation lesions destroying between 7 and 27% of the CeSR; the remaining three cats suffered bilateral lesions in the paramedial portion of the reticularis pontis oralis (RPO) and caudalis (RPC) nuclei. Six sham-operated animals were used as controls. Recordings were taken of all animals in continuous 23-h sessions once a week for 12 weeks. Results indicated that the threshold for SWC state changes (increase of wakefulness (W) and drowsiness (D), and decrease of slow wave sleep (SWS)) after CeSR lesion is approximately 11.3% following volumetric destruction of the nucleus. The amount of CeSR damage (CeSR-D) only correlated significantly with the amount of W (positive correlation) and SWS (negative correlation) during the first week post-lesion. The changes in W over the course of the study were different in the two experimental groups. In both groups, total W was increased with respect to the controls, however, these increases were observed earlier in the CeSR-D group. The return to near control values in SWC state over days 15-28 of the study does not represent a definitive recovery by the CeSR-D cats. All the SWC states returned to control values by the tenth week in the cats with paramedial reticular pontine damage.
2323715<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[Intracerebral sites of action of estrogen on the sleep-wakefulness circadian rhythm in female rats].<<>>Effects of estradiol on the sleep-wakefulness circadian rhythm were studied in ovariectomized female rats under a 12: 12 light-dark schedule. In rats that were subcutaneously injected with 20 micrograms of estradiol benzoate (EB) or that had crystalline EB implanted into the third ventricle (III V), the total time of slow wave sleep (SWS) and paradoxical sleep (PS) in the night time was significantly decreased on the third day after the EB administration. The suppression of PS was more remarkable than that of SWS. Slight increases were observed in the total time of SWS and PS in the day time. These effects of estrogen on the appearance patterns of SWS and PS in the night and day time could be elicited in spayed rats after crystalline EB was implanted into the medial preoptic area (MPO) or the medial amygdala (mAMYG), but the implant into the latter proved less effective. Cholesterol implants into IIIV, MPO or mAMYG produced no change in the sleep-wakefulness circadian pattern. Implantations of crystalline EB into the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus or the dorsomedial thalamic nucleus were ineffective. These results indicate that MPO is probably the most effective site of estrogen on the sleep-wakefulness circadian rhythm of female rats.
18234409<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Long-term changes in sleep and electroencephalographic activity by chronic vagus nerve stimulation in cats.<<>>We previously reported the effect of vagus nerve electrical stimulation (VNS) on sleep and behavior in cats. The aim of the present study is to analyze the long-term effects of VNS on the electroencephalographic (EEG) power spectrum and on the different stages of the sleep-wakefulness cycle in the freely moving cat. To achieve this, six male cats were implanted with electrodes on the left vagal nerve and submitted to 15 rounds of 23 h continuous sleep recordings in three categories: baseline (BL), VNS and post-stimulus recording (PSR). The following parameters were analyzed: EEG power spectrum, total time and number of sleep phases, ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) wave density of the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and the number of times the narcoleptic reflex was present (sudden transition from wakefulness to REM sleep). Significant changes were detected, such as an enhancement of slow-wave sleep (SWS) stage II; a power increase in the bands corresponding to sleep spindles (8-14 Hz) and delta waves (1-4 Hz) with VNS and PSR; an increase in the total time, number of stages, and density of PGO wave in REM sleep with VNS; a decrease of wakefulness in PSR, and the eventual appearance of the narcoleptic reflex with VNS. The results show that the effect of the VNS changes during different stages of the sleep-wakefulness cycle. In REM sleep, the effect was present only during VNS, while the SWS II was affected beyond VNS periods. This suggests that ponto-medullar and thalamic mechanisms of slow EEG activity may be due to plastic changes elicited by vagal stimulation.
6263409<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Changes in the levels of cyclic nucleotides in rat brain during the sleep-wakefulness cycle.<<>>Changes in the levels of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) in the discrete regions of rat brain during the sleep-wakefulness cycle were studied using a microwave fixation method. Rats were restrained in a specially designed frame in which they could move their heads and extremities freely and take food and water ad libitum. The rats were acclimatized to the microwave applicator for 1 h a day for 5-7 days, and then they were sacrificed by microwave irradiation of the heads under polygraphic monitoring. This procedure made it possible to obtain tissue for the analysis of cyclic nucleotides at different times during the sleep-wakefulness cycle. The content of cAMP in the various regions of the brain except the cerebellum decreased during sleep. In the hippocampus, midbrain, pons-medulla and cerebellum, the level of cGMP was highest during wakefulness, whereas in the striatum it was highest during paradoxical sleep. In the midbrain and pons-medulla, the level of cGMP was higher during paradoxical sleep than during slow-wave sleep. These changes of cyclic nucleotide contents may reflect the changes in the release of putative neurotransmitters during the sleep-wakefulness cycle. Our findings suggest that cyclic nucleotides may play some roles in the regulation of the sleep-wakefulness cycle.
12637592<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Shift work and disturbed sleep/wakefulness.<<>>Of the many health-related effects of shift work, disturbed sleep is the most common. This review describes the main observed effects of the three principal shifts (night, morning and afternoon) on patterns of sleep and wakefulness. The mechanism of sleep disruption in relation to circadian rhythms and the specific impact of aspects of shift organization (speed and direction of rotation) are discussed. The most troublesome acute symptoms are difficulty getting to sleep, shortened sleep and somnolence during working hours that continues into successive days off. These are only partially amenable to amelioration by manipulating shift patterns. However, there is no clear indication that chronic sleep problems result from long-term shift work.
2062895<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Sleep-wakefulness patterns in the helpless rat.<<>>Sleep-wakefulness patterns were analyzed during a 15-day period in the rat, in relation to induction of helplessness. After a session of inescapable electric footshocks, rats did exhibit escape deficits in avoidance conditioning as classically described, and their spontaneous sleep-wakefulness patterns were not different from those of controls. However, reduced PS latency and increased PS amounts were observed in the helpless group after shuttle-box sessions, especially during the initial period after the induction of helplessness. Such modifications of PS latency and PS amounts are evocative of the sleep impairments classically observed in endogenous depression.
7878113<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Medial preoptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness.<<>>Adrenergic alpha 2 agonist (clonidine) and its antagonist (yohimbine) were locally applied to the medial preoptic area (mPOA), to find out the role of alpha 2 receptors at this brain region in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness. Clonidine produced arousal, whereas yohimbine induced sleep in freely moving animals. Behavioural arousal produced by clonidine administration was accompanied by EEG synchronization. The alpha 2 receptor as the probable site of action of externally applied norepinephrine (NE), is discussed.
29309677<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Sleep/Wake Behaviors in Mice During Pregnancy and Pregnancy-Associated Hypertensive Mice.<<>>Study Objectives: In humans and other mammals, sleep is altered during pregnancy. However, no studies have been conducted on sleep/wakefulness during pregnancy in mice. In this study, we examined sleep/wakefulness in female C57BL/6 mice during pregnancy. We also examined sleep/wake behaviors in an animal model of preeclampsia, pregnancy-associated hypertensive (PAH) mice, in which increased angiotensin causes hypertension. Methods: Sleep/wake behaviors of female C57BL/6 and PAH mice were examined based on electroencephalogram (EEG) or electromyogram recordings before, during, and after pregnancy. To examine whether high blood pressure disrupts the integrity of the blood-brain barrier in PAH mice, Evans blue dye was injected intravenously. Angiotensin II receptor blocker (olmesartan)-administered PAH mice and female Tsukuba hypertensive mice were also examined. Results: C57BL/6 mice showed a decreased total wake time and increased nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep time during late pregnancy. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time did not change during the course of pregnancy. PAH mice exhibited a general slowing of EEG during late pregnancy and subsequently returned to apparently normal sleep/wakefulness after delivery. All PAH mice exhibited multiple focal leakages of Evans blue dye in the brain. Spike-and-wave discharges were observed in 50% of PAH mice. Olmesartan-administered PAH mice did not show general slowing of EEG. Tsukuba hypertensive mice showed a normal time spent in wakefulness and NREM sleep and a decreased total REM sleep time. Conclusions: This study showed pregnant-stage-specific changes in sleep/wakefulness in C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, PAH mice may be useful as an animal model for eclampsia.
7814075<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Effect of carbachol injection in the medial preoptic area on sleep-wakefulness and body temperature in free moving rats.<<>>The aim of the present study was to find out the changes in sleep-wakefulness and body temperature brought about by application of cholinergic agonist, carbachol, in the medial preoptic area (mPOA). Carbachol, when injected bilaterally into the mPOA of male rats, through chronically implanted cannulae, produced a fall in rectal temperature and long lasting arousal. There was temporal dissociation in the duration of changes produced in the two parameters. It is suggested that the cholinergic system at the medial preoptic area brings about arousal response and fall in body temperature through different circuits.
7953774<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Role of lateral preoptic area alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors in sleep-wakefulness and body temperature regulation.<<>>The preoptic area is anatomically divided into medial and lateral portions and both are involved in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness and body temperature. We have recently reported the specific role of the adrenoceptors, present in the medial preoptic area, in the regulation of those functions. In this study an attempt was made to investigate the specific participation and contribution of the lateral preoptic area alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness and body temperature. Sleep-wakefulness and rectal temperature were simultaneously recorded in freely moving rats, both during day and night, under normal condition and after bilateral local microinjection of either agonist or antagonist of alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors into the lateral preoptic area. The results suggest that the lateral preoptic area alpha-2 adrenoceptors are predominantly involved in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness whereas alpha-1 adrenoceptors are more effective in thermoregulation.
30988168<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>EEG Frontal Alpha Asymmetry and Dream Affect: Alpha Oscillations over the Right Frontal Cortex during REM Sleep and Presleep Wakefulness Predict Anger in REM Sleep Dreams.<<>>Affective experiences are central not only to our waking life but also to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep dreams. Despite our increasing understanding of the neural correlates of dreaming, we know little about the neural correlates of dream affect. Frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) is considered a marker of affective states and traits as well as affect regulation in the waking state. Here, we explored whether FAA during REM sleep and during evening resting wakefulness is related to affective experiences in REM sleep dreams. EEG recordings were obtained from 17 human participants (7 men) who spent 2 nights in the sleep laboratory. Participants were awakened 5 min after the onset of every REM stage after which they provided a dream report and rated their dream affect. Two-minute preawakening EEG segments were analyzed. Additionally, 8 min of evening presleep and morning postsleep EEG were recorded during resting wakefulness. Mean spectral power in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) and corresponding FAA were calculated over the frontal (F4-F3) sites. Results showed that FAA during REM sleep, and during evening resting wakefulness, predicted ratings of dream anger. This suggests that individuals with greater alpha power in the right frontal hemisphere may be less able to regulate (i.e., inhibit) strong affective states, such as anger, in dreams. Additionally, FAA was positively correlated across wakefulness and REM sleep. Together, these findings imply that FAA may serve as a neural correlate of affect regulation not only in the waking but also in the dreaming state.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We experience emotions not only during wakefulness but also during dreaming. Despite our increasing understanding of the neural correlates of dreaming, we know little about the neural correlates of dream emotions. Here we used electroencephalography to explore how frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA)-the relative difference in alpha power between the right and left frontal cortical areas that is associated with emotional processing and emotion regulation in wakefulness-is related to dream emotions. We show that individuals with greater FAA (i.e., greater right-sided alpha power) during rapid eye movement sleep, and during evening wakefulness, experience more anger in dreams. FAA may thus reflect the ability to regulate emotions not only in the waking but also in the dreaming state.
3350096<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Interrelationship of thermal and sleep-wakefulness changes elicited from the medial preoptic area in rats.<<>>The study investigated the possible interrelationship between changes in sleep-wakefulness and body temperature, primarily induced by manipulation of the noradrenergic system in the medial preoptic area. Saline, norepinephrine, and its alpha- and beta-blockers were injected in the medial preoptic area and in some control areas of rats, during their sleeping and active periods. 5-Hydroxytryptamine was injected in the medial preoptic area in another group of animals. Simultaneous changes in sleep-wakefulness and the body temperature were continuously recorded. Norepinephrine produced hypothermia and arousal, whereas alpha-adrenergic blockers induced hyperthermia and sleep. These changes in body temperature and in sleep-wakefulness did not follow an identical time course. 5-Hydroxytryptamine induced hyperthermia without affecting sleep-wakefulness. It is suggested that there are different neuronal mechanisms in the medial preoptic area that bring about the drug-induced changes in temperature and sleep-wakefulness.
9147403<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Inter-individual differences in the effects of acute stress on the sleep-wakefulness cycle in the rat.<<>>It has been described that an acute immobilization stress (IS) modifies subsequent paradoxical sleep (PS). However, its effects are complex because some subjects remain unaffected. This discrepancy might result from constitutive inter-individual psychobiological differences. In order to test this hypothesis, an inter-individual analysis of sleep patterns and their modifications after 60 min IS has been performed. Even though global analysis showed a PS increase after IS, inter-individual analysis evidenced different PS reactivity; subjects which had the least PS during control recordings were those with the largest PS increase. Unlike global analysis, an inter-individual study evidenced different modifications of wakefulness and slow wave sleep according to individuals. Subjects presenting the highest amount of wakefulness in control conditions (the lowest amount of slow wave sleep) decreased their wakefulness amount, while subjects with the lowest amount of wakefulness increased it. Thus, individual characteristics of the sleep-wakefulness cycle should be considered while studying its modifications induced by different treatments.
3575471<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Circadian rhythms in sleep-wakefulness and wheel-running activity in a congenitally anophthalmic rat mutant.<<>>Circadian rhythms were examined in a congenitally anophthalmic rat mutant. All bilaterally anophthalmic rats had clear circadian rhythms in sleep-wakefulness as well as in locomotor activity, but the rhythms did not entrain to the light-dark (LD) cycle. However, two unilaterally anophthalmic rats, like sighted rats, reentrained their sleep-wakefulness rhythms to the LD cycle in 4 days after a 6 hr delaying phase-shift. The hypogenesis of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) that is correlated with absence of circadian activity rhythms in anophthalmic mice was not observed in these anophthalmic rats.
19604806<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Independence of sleep-wakefulness cycle in an implanted head 'encephale isole'.<<>>A quantitative study was carried out on the sleep-wakefulness cycle by means of EEG recordings taken simultaneously from a dog's implanted head and its host. During survival (108 h), neurological activities of the implanted head were similar to those of classic 'encephale isole' preparations. In spite of a common circulation, the sleep-wakefulness cycles of the implanted head and host animal were independent. Independence was manifested by: (1) differing percentages of respective phases of their cycles; (2) periods of coincident phases in both heads, only occasionally beginning and/or stopping simultaneously; and (3) the implanted 'encephale isole' showed a monotonous cycle with numerous periods of short duration throughout night or day. The host presented a nycthemeral rhythm.
6479381<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[A 3-hour period ultradian rhythm of the sleep-wakefulness cycle and growth hormone secretion in the immature rat].<<>>The temporal patterns of the sleep-wakefulness cycle and growth hormone secretion throughout a day in the male and female rat were studied in male and rats at 27 approximately 31 days of age. EEGs were recorded continuously from 27 to 31 days of age, and a time series of the amount of sleep for every 10 min was obtained. Serial blood sampling through an intracardiac cannula at 10-min intervals was performed for each of the 6-h periods beginning at 12:00, 18:00, 00:00 and 06:00 h. By analysis of the power spectrum and the least squares method, the time series was found to have approximately a 3.0-h periodicity in any of the 6-h periods and in either sex. The peak time which was estimated for the time series of GH concentrations was found to occur consistently around 02:00 approximately 03:00, 05:00 approximately 06:00, 08:00 approximately 09:00, 11:00 approximately 12:00, 14:00 approximately 15:00, 17:00 approximately 18:00, 20:00 approximately 21:00 and 23:00 approximately 24:00 h in either the male or the female rat. The time series of the amount of sleep over a 24-h period at 29 days of age revealed an ultradian rhythm with approximately a 3.0-h periodicity, and the peak time was estimated to be the same as that for the GH time series Taking the findings that the GH secretion is related to sleep in the prepubertal rat as described in the accompanying paper (Tsai, 1983), it could be speculated that the rat GH secretory rhythm develops by 30 days of age as a 3.0-h period ultradian rhythm that entrains to the time of day, relating to the rhythm of the sleep-wakefulness cycle.
2696458<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>The development of sleep-wakefulness cycle and its correlation to other behavior in the human fetus.<<>>Fetal rapid eye movements (REM), breathing movements (BM), and trunk movements (TM) were observed through the use of 3 ultrasonic real-time scanners. Each movement was recorded with the event marker and quantitatively analyzed in relation to the development of the sleep-wakefulness cycle by a computer-assisted system. The results were as follows: The number of REM increased with gestational age. The appearance rate of REM reached a certain level after 32 weeks of gestation. REM-non-REM rhythm was distinguished after 32 weeks. The relationship between REM and BM increased with gestational age. The occurrence of each TM has no correlation to that of REM when it was analyzed in short-term units, but the incidence of TM was high in REM periods. These results demonstrate the course of the development of sleep-wakefulness cycle in human fetuses.
2054228<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[Sodium regulation disorder, hypothermia, and circadian rhythm disturbances of the body temperature and sleep-wakefulness as sequelae of acute subdural hematoma].<<>>We reported an 11-year-old boy who suffered from transient hypernatremia, hypothermia, and circadian rhythm disturbances of sleep-wakefulness and body temperature from the age of 4 years, as sequelae of acute subdural hematoma. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed low intensity consistent with necrotic change in the whole left cerebral hemisphere, hypothalamic region, and the right-sided brain stem including tegmentum, while the pituitary structure was well preserved. Anterior pituitary function was almost normal. ADH (antidiuretic hormone) was neither stimulated by hyperosmolality nor suppressed by hyposmolality but continued to be secreted at almost constant level approximating the normal basal state. This pattern seemed to be due to complete destruction of the osmoreceptor located in the anterior hypothalamus. He exhibited a dispersed-type sleep with differentiated stages of NREM (non-rapid eye movement), although the percentage of sleep was higher at night than in the daytime. It is suggested that circadian rhythm of sleep-wakefulness and differentiation of NREM sleep stages are regulated by different neuromechanisms. Brain stem lesion on MRI may be connected with the pathogenesis of the dispersed-type sleep with special respect to amplitude reduction of sleep-waking circadian rhythm. Circadian rhythm of body temperature (BT) was irregular in amplitude, phase, and period without synchronization with sleep-wakefulness rhythm. Hypothermia was also demonstrated at the basal state, while BT increased when he suffered from respiratory infection. It is likely that hypothermia in our case is caused by the BT shift to the lower side due to malfunction of BT integrating system including preoptic area and anterior hypothalamus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
4047331<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Simultaneous determination of blood levels of corticosterone and growth hormone in the male rat: relation to sleep-wakefulness cycle.<<>>The temporal correlation of the secretion of corticosterone (CS) and growth hormone (GH) with the sleep-wakefulness cycle in adult male rats was studied by serial blood sampling at 10-min intervals over a 11-hour period from 11.00 to 22.00 h. Cortical EEGs recorded continuously during the blood sampling were scored into wakefulness and sleep, and the amounts of sleep for every 10 min was plotted against the CS and GH values. All 11-hour time series of CS, GH and amount of sleep were found to have three major ultradian rhythms with periodicities of 1.5 h and its multiples. For CS, there was a significantly negative cross-correlation between the amounts of sleep. Although the most prominent CS rhythm was the 1.5-hour period, CS secretion occurring with a 3.0-hour period had such a phase relationship with the 3.0-hour period sleep rhythm that the secretion began in the late stage of sleep cycle and reached its peak around the time of wakefulness between sleep cycles. In contrast, a GH secretory burst occurred in the early stage of the sleep cycle occurring with a 3.0-hour period, with a definite time lag after the onset of the sleep cycle. The present study demonstrates that three different functions, CS, GH secretions and sleep-wakefulness, have common ultradian rhythms with similar periods, and manifest their rhythms based on their own pacemakers. It is assumed further that each pacemaker is fixed in specific phase relations with others.
7832296<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Effects of opioid microinjections in the nucleus of the solitary tract on the sleep-wakefulness cycle states in cats.<<>>BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that the region of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NST) is involved in the control of electrocortical activity and in sleep mechanisms. It also is well known that this region contains the highest concentration of opioid receptors within the medullary brainstem. The involvement of the NST opioid system in sleep-wakefulness states were evaluated. METHODS: Ten cats were implanted with electrodes for chronic polygraphic recordings of their sleep-wakefulness states and provided with an implanted guide cannula stereotaxically aimed at the NST region. Microinjections of saline, morphine sulfate, morphiceptin (specific mu agonist), D-pen-2-D-pen-5-enkephalin (delta agonist), and U-50488H (kappa agonist) were given to the freely moving animals (doses 0.8-2.4 x 10(-9) M, in a volume of 0.05 microliters of saline). After microinjections, sleep-wakefulness recordings were obtained for 8 h. RESULTS: Morphine microinjections in NST provoked a dose-dependent enhancement of all the polygraphic and behavioral manifestations of slow wave sleep. This effect was blocked by the prior intraperitoneal administration of naloxone. The mu and delta agonists also produced a hypnotic effect by enhancing slow wave sleep. By contrast, the kappa agonist caused no changes in sleep-wakefulness states. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that endogenous opioids could be involved in controlling electrocortical activity generated by NST and that activation of mu and delta NST opioid receptors enhanced the electroencephalographic synchronization associated with behavioral slow wave sleep in cats.
837222<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Analysis of sleep-wakefulness rhythms in male rats after suprachiasmatic nucleus lesions and ocular enucleation.<<>>To determine quantitatively characteristics of sleep-wakefulness rhythms in male albino rats, computer analysis of long term polygraphic records (24 h/day) of cortical EEG activity, neck EMG and EOG taken from 23 rats under 12:12 light-dark schedule was performed. After bilateral suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) lesions, the circadian rhythm in sleep-wakefulness was completely eliminated, although no attenuation or even slight enhancement of the ultradian rhythms with 2-4 h pweiodicity was observed. After enucleation of both eyes, the circadian rhythm was free-running with a phase shift in the range from --12 to +22 min/day in 6 rats. A gradual decrease of the spectral value of the circadian rhythm and inverse enhancement of the ultradian rhythms with 4--7 h periodicity (predominantly 6 h in 4 out of 6 rats) were also shown. In the spectral diagram, the appearance of paradoxical sleep (PS) paralleled slow-wave sleep (SWS), in the cases of the circadian rhythm and ultradian rhythms with 4--7 h periodicity. Behaviorally blind rats with bilateral primary optic tract (POT) lesions maintained the circadian rhythm in sleep-wakefulness entrained to the environmental light-dark cycle. Power spectral analysis showed no characteristic difference from normal rats. Based on these data, the role of the SCN as a pacemaker of endogenous circadian rhythm in sleep-wakefulness is discussed.
18795255<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Sleep and non-invasive ventilation in patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency.<<>>OBJECTIVE: Noninvasive ventilation with pressure support (NIV-PS) therapy can augment ventilation; however, such therapy is fixed and may not adapt to varied patient needs. We tested the hypothesis that in patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency, a newer mode of ventilation [averaged volume assured pressure support (AVAPS)] and lateral decubitus position were associated with better sleep efficiency than NIV-PS and supine position. Our secondary aim was to assess the effect of mode of ventilation, body position, and sleep-wakefulness state on minute ventilation (V(E)) in the same patients. DESIGN: Single-blind, randomized, cross-over, prospective study. SETTING: Academic institution. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight patients. INTERVENTIONS: NIV-PS or AVAPS therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Three sleep studies were performed in each patient; prescription validation night, AVAPS or NIV-PS, and crossover to alternate mode. Sleep was not different between AVAPS and NIV-PS. Supine body position was associated with worse sleep efficiency than lateral decubitus position (77.9 +/- 22.9 and 85.2 +/- 10.5%; P = 0.04). V(E) was lower during stage 2 NREM and REM sleep than during wakefulness (P < 0.0001); was lower during NIV-PS than AVAPS (P = 0.029); tended to be lower with greater body mass index (P = 0.07), but was not influenced by body position. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency, supine position was associated with worse sleep efficiency than the lateral decubitus position. AVAPS was comparable to NIV-PS therapy with regard to sleep, but statistically greater V(E) during AVAPS than NIV-PS of unclear significance was observed. V(E) was determined by sleep-wakefulness state, body mass index, and mode of therapy.
7957024<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>The effect of four-day round trip flights over 10 time zones on the sleep-wakefulness patterns of airline flight attendants.<<>>To study the effect of a four-day-round trip flight on the sleep-wakefulness of airline flight attendants, subjective sleep-wakefulness and autonomic sleep phases were measured. Forty flight attendants (mean age 33 years, range 21-50) kept daily logs on sleepiness, the time when going to bed, and sleep quality. In addition, the autonomic sleep phases of 21 subjects were studied by the static charge sensitive bed (SCSB) method. After the westward flight, the subjects went to bed approximately 1-3 h local time earlier during the first few days and were very sleepy compared to the week before the flight. There was a significant increase in the number of awakenings and in the feeling of 'not being at all rested' in the mornings. After the return flight eastwards, the subjects were very sleepy on the first evening but slept rather well for about 11 h. During the three following days, sleep restlessness, difficulties in falling asleep, and the feelings of sleepiness in the mornings increased compared to the week before the flights. Four days after the return flight, sleep length and the quality of sleep were, on average, the same as before the flights. According to the SCSB method, there were only small changes in the autonomic sleep phases due to the flights. After the westward flight, quiet sleep increased and intermediate sleep decreased compared to the sleep before the flight. The results indicate that most flight attendants have significant disturbances in sleep quality after transmedian flights. Sleep disturbances increase after both westward and eastward transmedian flights, but differ from each other in specific features.
18809531<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Sleep and behavioral correlates of napping among young adults: a survey of first-year university students in Madrid, Spain.<<>>OBJECTIVE: Between November 2002 and March 2003, the authors assessed the prevalence and correlates of napping among Spanish university students. PARTICIPANTS: The sample comprised 1,276 first-year university students; the mean age was 18.74 +/- 1.24 years, and 35.45% were men. METHODS: The study was cross-sectional, and the students completed self-report, anonymous questionnaires provided during an in-class survey. RESULTS: Almost half (44%) of the sample reported napping (90% did so after lunch for longer than 1 hour). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that experiencing an irregular sleep-wakefulness pattern, having a morning school schedule, and being male were significant predictor variables of napping. Further significant outcome variables related to napping were having excessive daytime sleepiness, missing classes because of tiredness, better ability to concentrate later in the afternoon, and a perception of deeper nighttime sleep. CONCLUSIONS: Habitual napping is common among Spanish university students and associated with an irregular sleep-wakefulness pattern. Taking long postlunch naps seems to be used by students to cope with insufficient sleep and daytime sleepiness.
25915066<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>The Timing of the Circadian Clock and Sleep Differ between Napping and Non-Napping Toddlers.<<>>The timing of the internal circadian clock shows large inter-individual variability across the lifespan. Although the sleep-wakefulness pattern of most toddlers includes an afternoon nap, the association between napping and circadian phase in early childhood remains unexplored. This study examined differences in circadian phase and sleep between napping and non-napping toddlers. Data were collected on 20 toddlers (34.2+/-2.0 months; 12 females; 15 nappers). Children followed their habitual napping and non-napping sleep schedules (monitored with actigraphy) for 5 days before an in-home salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) assessment. On average, napping children fell asleep during their nap opportunities on 3.6+/-1.2 of the 5 days before the DLMO assessment. For these napping children, melatonin onset time was 38 min later (p = 0.044; d = 0.93), actigraphically-estimated bedtime was 43 min later (p = 0.014; d = 1.24), sleep onset time was 59 min later (p = 0.006; d = 1.46), and sleep onset latency was 16 min longer (p = 0.030; d = 1.03) than those not napping. Midsleep and wake time did not differ by napping status. No difference was observed in the bedtime, sleep onset, or midsleep phase relationships with DLMO; however, the wake time phase difference was 47 min smaller for napping toddlers (p = 0.029; d = 1.23). On average, nappers had 69 min shorter nighttime sleep durations (p = 0.006; d = 1.47) and spent 49 min less time in bed (p = 0.019; d = 1.16) than non-nappers. Number of days napping was correlated with melatonin onset time (r = 0.49; p = 0.014). Our findings indicate that napping influences individual variability in melatonin onset time in early childhood. The delayed bedtimes of napping toddlers likely permits light exposure later in the evening, thereby delaying the timing of the clock and sleep. Whether the early developmental trajectory of circadian phase involves an advance associated with the decline in napping is a question necessitating longitudinal data as children transition from a biphasic to monophasic sleep-wakefulness pattern.
18407254<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>GABAergic and non-GABAergic thalamic, hypothalamic and basal forebrain projections to the ventral oral pontine reticular nucleus: their implication in REM sleep modulation.<<>>The ventral part of the oral pontine reticular nucleus (vRPO) is a demonstrated site of brainstem REM-sleep generation and maintenance. The vRPO has reciprocal connections with structures that control other states of the sleep-wakefulness cycle, many situated in the basal forebrain and the diencephalon. Some of these connections utilize the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. The aim of the present work is to map the local origin of the basal forebrain and diencephalon projections to the vRPO whether GABAergic or non-GABAergic. A double-labelling technique combining vRPO injections of the neuronal tracer, cholera-toxin (CTB), with GAD-immunohistochemistry, was used for this purpose in adult cats. All of the numerous CTB-positive neurons in the reticular thalamic and dorsocaudal hypothalamic nuclei were double-labelled (CTB/GAD-positive) neurons. Approximately 15%, 14% and 16% of the CTB-positive neurons in the zona incerta and the dorsal and lateral hypothalamic areas are, respectively, CTB/GAD-positive neurons. However, only some double-labelled neurons were found in other hypothalamic nuclei with abundant CTB-positive neurons, such as the paraventricular nucleus, perifornical area and H1 Forel field. In addition, CTB-positive neurons were abundant in the central amygdaline nucleus, terminal stria bed nuclei, median preoptic nucleus, medial and lateral preoptic areas, dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei, posterior hypothalamic area and periventricular thalamic nucleus. The GABAergic and non-GABAergic connections described here may be the morphological pillar through which these prosencephalic structures modulate, either by inhibiting or by exciting, the vRPO REM-sleep inducing neurons during the different sleep-wakefulness cycle states.
12852211<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[Impulse activity of neurons in the nucleus pontis oralis in cats during sleep--wakefulness cycle].<<>>The nucleus pontis oralis contains several populations of neurons showing distinct sleep-waking discharge patterns. PS-on, PS-off cells, and neurons that discharged in association with phasic movements during paradoxical sleep and/or waking, were found. The findings suggest that different populations of the nucleus pontis oralis neurons take a distinct part in paradoxical sleep control.
6198143<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Study of sleep-wakefulness states by computer graphics and cluster analysis before and after lesions of the pontine tegmentum in the cat.<<>>A computerized method of quantification, graphic representation and classification of sleep-wakefulness data in the cat before and after pontine tegmental lesions has been presented. Electrophysiological signal features including average EEG amplitude, average EMG amplitude and PGO spike rate which are particularly important for the definition of sleep-wakefulness states have been quantified for each 1 min epoch in the day. The data were presented in a projected 3-dimensional data display, in which they formed clusters that are considered to be analogous to sleep-wakefulness states. A cluster analysis algorithm was employed for the automatic classification of these data, and this automatic classification was compared graphically and with contingency table analyses to traditional visual assessment of state from polygraphic records. Although there were systematic differences in the locations of state boundaries, total percent agreement between cluster analysis classification and traditional human classification was comparable to the percent agreement between any two human classifiers (about 90%). After pontine tegmental lesions involving both the gigantocellular and lateral tegmental fields, paradoxical sleep was eliminated, and the characteristics of slow wave sleep and wakefulness were altered. The elimination of the state of paradoxical sleep was evident in the computer display by the absence of the paradoxical sleep cluster, and alterations of the other states were indicated in the display by shifts in the positions of their respective clusters. Automatic classification of slow wave sleep and wakefulness after such lesions compared well with traditional classification, attesting to the validity of this approach.
3200413<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Influence of some monoamine oxidase inhibitors on the sleep-wakefulness cycle of the cat.<<>>The influence of some monoamine oxidase inhibitors (phenelzine, transamin [tranylcypromine], nialamide) on the structure of the sleep-wakefulness cycle of the cat was studied. It was shown that these monoamine oxidase inhibitors elicit and increase in slow-wave sleep in the sleep-wakefulness cycle due to complete suppression of paradoxical sleep and significant decrease in wakefulness. After the cessation of the action of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, a selective rebound of wakefulness is observed against the background of complete or partial absence of paradoxical sleep. The gives grounds for the hypothesis that during partial deprivation of wakefulness under the influence of monoamine oxidase inhibitors an intensification occurs on the accumulation of specific need for this physiological state, the satisfaction of which is accomplished as the result of its rebound in the post-deprivational cycle, i.e., after the termination of the EEG of the synchronizing effect of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
6083632<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Acute effects of toluene on circadian rhythms of sleep-wakefulness and brain monoamine metabolism in rats.<<>>Acute effects of a single i.p. injection of toluene on circadian rhythms of sleep-wakefulness were investigated in rats which were chronically implanted with EEG and EMG electrodes for polygraphic recordings. The toluene injection produced an initial increase in wakefulness (W) and a subsequent increase in slow-wave sleep (SWS) during the dark period. In an attempt to clarify mechanisms of these biphasic effects of toluene on sleep-wakefulness rhythms, brain monoamines and their metabolites were determined at the times of the initial increase in W and the increased SWS. The initial increase in W was associated with an increase in cortical NA, MHPG and 5-HT together with a decrease in cortical 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), while the increased SWS during the dark period was associated with an increase in 5-HIAA and a concomitant decrease in 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG). The toluene-induced changes in sleep-wakefulness seemed to be manifested at lower blood levels of toluene than the behavioral signs of central nervous system (CNS) depression. These biphasic effects of toluene on circadian sleep-wakefulness rhythms are discussed in terms of the reciprocal interactions between central 5-HT and NA neurons.
18318174<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[The effect of dopaminergic nigrostriatal system on sleep deprivation in rats].<<>>The analysis of the electrophysiological features of sleep-wakefulness cycle in Wistar rats for 9h after a 6h sleep deprivation was carried out. The delay of sleep rebound (since 2.5-3 h after deprivation) was found in the form of moderate increasing of slow-wave sleep and fast-wave sleep phases. According to these sleep-wakefulness cycle changes, a quantitative immunohistochemical study of tyrosine hydroxylase: a key enzyme of dopamine synthesis--and D1 and D2 receptors in nigro-striatal projections has been performed. After sleep, an elevation of D1 receptors immunoreactivity in caudate nucleus and reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in compact part of substancia nigra was found. After postdeprivation sleep, a decrease of D1 receptors immunoreactivity and increase of D2 receptors immunoreactivity in caudate nucleus together some increase of tyrosine hydroxilase immunoreactivity in substancia nigra compacta has been observed. These data can testify about active role of dopaminergic nigrostriatal system which provide at the same time with another neurotransmitters of the central nervous system the telencephalo-diencephalic interaction in sleep-wakefulness-sleep cycle.
9035524<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[Mechanisms of dream-sleep-wakefulness cycle].<<>>For the occurrence of each state of sleep (slow wave sleep, paradoxical sleep) there are two neuronal networks. The first one called executive is responsible for the sleep phenomenology; the second called permissive is for the triggering of sleep. Wakefulness depends on a very complex system (10 structures) including the permissive networks which inhibit sleep. Sleep onset is thought as a blockade of the waking state by an antiwake network synthesizing hypnogenic factors. Such a regulation allows to suggest that insomnia is a wake trouble depending on a revisited therapy.
20105243<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Basal ganglia control of sleep-wake behavior and cortical activation.<<>>The basal ganglia (BG) are involved in numerous neurobiological processes that operate on the basis of wakefulness, including motor function, learning, emotion and addictive behaviors. We hypothesized that the BG might play an important role in the regulation of wakefulness. To test this prediction, we made cell body-specific lesions in the striatum and globus pallidus (GP) using ibotenic acid. We found that rats with striatal (caudoputamen) lesions exhibited a 14.95% reduction in wakefulness and robust fragmentation of sleep-wake behavior, i.e. an increased number of state transitions and loss of ultra-long wake bouts (> 120 min). These lesions also resulted in a reduction in the diurnal variation of sleep-wakefulness. On the other hand, lesions of the accumbens core resulted in a 26.72% increase in wakefulness and a reduction in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep bout duration. In addition, rats with accumbens core lesions exhibited excessive digging and scratching. GP lesions also produced a robust increase in wakefulness (45.52%), and frequent sleep-wake transitions and a concomitant decrease in NREM sleep bout duration. Lesions of the subthalamic nucleus or the substantia nigra reticular nucleus produced only minor changes in the amount of sleep-wakefulness and did not alter sleep architecture. Finally, power spectral analysis revealed that lesions of the striatum, accumbens and GP slowed down the cortical electroencephalogram. Collectively, our results suggest that the BG, via a cortico-striato-pallidal loop, are important neural circuitry regulating sleep-wake behaviors and cortical activation.
6514063<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[Dynamics of the neuronal activity of midbrain reticular nuclei in the sleep-wakefulness cycle].<<>>Dynamics of neuronal activity of the mesencephalic reticular nuclei (n. cuneiformis, n. parabrachialis) in the sleep-wakefulness cycle was studied in free moving rats using mobile metallic microelectrodes. Computer analysis and statistical treatment of data have shown that the majority of neurons in the above-mentioned reticular nuclei of the mesencephalon (76% and 66%, respectively) generate with high frequencies during active wakefulness and emotional stage of paradoxical sleep; the frequency of discharges is less during passive wakefulness and nonemotional stage of paradoxical sleep, while in the slow-wave sleep they exhibit the least activity. Comparatively small number of neurons (24%, 15%) show inverse dynamics of activity. They fire more intensively during slow wave sleep and the frequency of discharges decreases during active wakefulness and emotional stage of paradoxical sleep. During quiet wakefulness and nonemotional stage of paradoxical sleep the neuronal activity attains the level observed in a slow-wave sleep. In n. parabrachialis some neurons are found which fire intensively during active wakefulness, the frequency of their discharges decreases in passive wakefulness and slow-wave sleep and is the least in paradoxical sleep. The similarity and difference of the neurophysiological mechanisms of phases and stages of the sleep-wakefulness cycle are discussed.
1648245<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Effect of histamine depletion on the circadian amplitude of the sleep-wakefulness cycle.<<>>Behavioral states of rats were automatically classified with a newly developed computer program into three sleep stages (awake, slow-wave sleep and REM sleep) from continuous long-term EEG and EMG recordings for several circadian cycles under entrained circumstances (L:D = 12:12). Histamine was depleted by 100 mg/kg intraperitoneal administration of a specific inhibitor of its synthesis, alpha-fluoromethylhistidine, in the mid-light period. This treatment had no effect on the amount of each sleep stage in the total 24-h period or in the light period, but caused significant increases in slow-wave sleep and REM sleep in the dark period. Equivalent decrease in the awake stage during the dark period was also observed. As a result, histamine depletion decreased the light:dark ratio of slow-wave sleep. These findings suggest that decrease of the histamine content of the brain attenuated the circadian amplitude of sleep-wakefulness by suppressing the surge of wakefulness during the dark period. From these results, histamine is suggested to modulate the circadian amplitude of the sleep-wakefulness cycle.
18977258<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Electrophysiological effects of orexins/hypocretins on pedunculopontine tegmental neurons in rats: an in vitro study.<<>>Orexin-A (ORX-A) and orexin-B (ORX-B) play critical roles in the regulation of sleep-wakefulness and feeding. ORX neurons project to the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT), which regulates waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Thus, we examined electrophysiological effects of ORXs on rat PPT neurons with a soma size of more than 30 microm. Whole cell patch clamp recording in vitro revealed that ORX-A and ORX-B depolarized PPT neurons dose-dependently in normal and/or tetrodotoxin containing artificial cerebrospinal fluids (ACSFs), and the EC(50) values for ORX-A and ORX-B were 66 nM and 536 nM, respectively. SB-334867, a selective inhibitor for ORX 1 (OX(1)) receptors, significantly suppressed the ORX-A-induced depolarization. The ORX-A-induced depolarization was reduced in high K(+) ACSF with extracellular K(+) concentration of 13.25 mM or N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG(+))-containing ACSF in which NaCl was replaced with NMDG-Cl, and abolished in high K(+)-NMDG(+) ACSF or in a combination of NMDG(+) ACSF and recordings with Cs(+)-containing pipettes. An inhibitor of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger and chelating intracellular Ca(2+) had no effect on the depolarization. Most of PPT neurons studied were characterized by an A-current or both A-current and a low threshold Ca(2+) spike, and predominantly cholinergic. These results suggest that ORXs directly depolarize PPT neurons via OX(1) receptors and via a dual ionic mechanism including a decrease of K(+) conductances and an increase of non-selective cationic conductances, and support the notion that ORX neurons affect the activity of PPT neurons directly and/or indirectly to control sleep-wakefulness, especially REM sleep.
9424194<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[Features of the sleep/wakefulness cycle in long-term isolation].<<>>The sleep/wakefulness cycle was the subject of polysomonographic and actographic studies in two experiments with isolation and confinement of six volunteer operators for 135 and 90 days. The dynamics of sleep structure was the target parameter before, during, and after the experiments. The sleep structure dynamics and changes in the motor activity differed in their directionality. At all the stages of experiments the operators' sleep structure had some unique peculiarities. Discussion is centered around the cases of shortened duration of delta-sleep and altered latent periods of specific stages. During the off-nominal situation (ONS) with 45 hour sleep deprivation polysomnographs recorded episodes of latent sleep which became more multiple during the second ONS and were combined with signs of "slow" sleep, and increases in the index of motor activity during night sleep post ONS. Hence, adaptation to changed physical and social environments is manifested by a specific functional restructurization of the sleep/wakefulness cycle.
7327461<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>[Effects of afloqualone, a centrally acting muscle relaxant, on the sleep-wakefulness cycle in cats with chronically implanted electrodes (author's transl)].<<>>The present study was carried out to elucidate whether or whether not afloqualone has a hypnotic action because of its similarity in chemical structure to methaqualone. In the sleep-wakefulness cycles during the 8-hour observation period (9:00-17:00), afloqualone increased the percentages of resting (REST) and slow wave light sleep (SWLS) stages at a dose of 25 mg/kg (p.o.), producing a moderate muscle relaxation. Even at a dose of 50 mg/kg (p.o.) where a marked muscle relaxation was produced, afloqualone had no influence on the percentage of slow wave deep sleep (SWDS) stage, though it increased the percentages of SWLS and decreased the percentages of awake (AWK), REST and fast wave sleep (FWS) stages. On the other hand, tolperisone . HCl, chlormezanone, methaqualone and pentobarbital . Na, used as the reference drugs, all increased the percentage of SWDS stage, but either decreased or had no effect on the percentages of the other four stages at pharmacologically effective doses. From these results it was concluded that afloqualone seems to be devoid of a hypnotic action and has different effects on the sleep-wakefulness cycle than those of both the hypnotics and the other muscle relaxants used.
16533567<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>Tonic activity of alpha1 adrenergic receptors of the medial preoptic area contributes towards increased sleep in rats.<<>>Several studies have suggested that noradrenergic afferents to the medial preoptic area might be involved in hypnogenesis and in lowering the body temperature, and that the alpha1 adrenergic receptors might be mediating these responses. This study was undertaken to find out the changes in sleep-wakefulness and body temperature in rats, when these adrenergic receptors of the medial preoptic area are blocked by alpha1 selective antagonist, prazosin. Adult male Wistar rats were chronically implanted with electrooculogram, electroencephalogram and electromyogram electrodes for sleep-wakefulness assessment, and a bilateral guide cannula for microinjection of prazosin at the medial preoptic area. A radio-transmitter was implanted in the abdomen for telemetric measurement of body temperature in four groups of rats. Sleep-wakefulness was also assessed telemetrically in four other groups of rats. Sleep-wakefulness recordings from these rats were done in a specialized chamber, where they could move about freely and select the ambient temperature which they prefer. Prazosin induced a dose dependent increase in wake period and in body temperature, when microinjected into the medial preoptic area. Results suggest that preoptic alpha1 adrenergic receptors mediate hypnogenic and hypothermic responses. It is proposed that the noradrenergic afferents to the medial preoptic area, by tonic activation of alpha1 adrenergic receptors, contribute towards increase in sleep especially during the daytime.
1396274<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>A study on the development of sleep-wakefulness cycle in the human fetus.<<>>We observed fetal behavior by using three ultrasonic real-time scanners simultaneously in 30 normal pregnant women between 20 and 40 weeks of gestation and analyzed developmental changes in behavioral pattern focussing the attention on the characteristics of REM and non-REM sleep and wakeful state. The frequency of REM significantly increased with gestational age, and its occurrences formed a group in late pregnancy. REM and non-REM periods, which were defined as the phase with uninterrupted appearance of rapid eye movements and the phase without them over 3 min, respectively, became clearly distinguishable between 28 and 31 weeks of gestation. The correlation between the occurrence of rapid eye movements and breathing movements was high after 27 weeks. These results demonstrate the course of the development of sleep-wakefulness cycle in the human fetus.
2516324<<>>Sleep_Wakefulness<<>>The light-dark cycle modulates the effects of ritanserin on sleep-wakefulness patterns in the rat.<<>>The 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ritanserin (0.63 mg/kg IP) produced differential effects on sleep-wakefulness patterns in rats when administered during the light or dark period: an increase in the duration of deep slow wave sleep at the expense of light slow wave sleep, paradoxical sleep and wakefulness when injected during the light period, and no major sleep alteration when given at dark onset. Since circadian variations in serotonin receptor density might modulate the sleep response, we examined the effects of ritanserin on sleep in rats exposed to continuous light for 10 days, and whether 5-HT2 receptors were affected in separate groups of rats exposed to similar conditions. No significant changes in the KD- and Bmax -values of various receptors were found. However, ritanserin produced greater effects in continuous light conditions than when given during the light period in the 12-hr light-dark condition. This suggests a possible role of 5-HT2 receptors in the organization of sleep when the environmental photoperiod is disturbed.
27225802<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Serological evidence of acute rubella infection among under-fives in Mwanza: a threat to increasing rates of congenital rubella syndrome in Tanzania.<<>>BACKGROUND: Control of rubella infection is essential for preventing congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) and one of the important steps is to define a target population for vaccination. Therefore this study was done to determine serological evidence of acute rubella infection among under-fives in order to anticipate the magnitude of rubella virus transmission in Tanzania. METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving children aged between 1 and 59 months was conducted between September and October 2014 before national rubella vaccination campaigns commenced. Rubella IgM antibodies were detected using commercial indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Data were analyzed using STATA version 11. RESULTS: A total of230 under-fives were enrolled, their median age was 14 (Interquartile range (IQR) 7-26) months. The overall seroprevalence of rubella IgM antibodies was 10.9 % (25/230) with two confirmed cases of CRS. Two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test showed that the median age of rubella IgM seropositive children was significantly higher than that of IgM seronegative children (39 IQR: 18-51months vs. 14 IQR: 7-24 months, P < 0.001). On multivariate logistic regression analysis increase in age (OR: 1.07, 95 % CI; 1.03-1.1, P < 0.001) and residing in rural areas (OR: 8.07, 95 % CI; 1.43-45.6, P = 0.018) were independently found to predict acute rubella infection among under-fives. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that rubella virus is prevalent in our setting posing a risk of transmitting to childbearing aged women hence increasing the risk of CRS. Increasing prevalence of acute infection with age in under-fives indicates the protective role of maternal antibodies among infants. The sustained vaccination programme of under-fives as effective measure to control CRS should be emphasized in developing countries.
25899613<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Effect of attention control on sustained attention during induced anxiety.<<>>Anxiety has wide-reaching and complex effects on cognitive performance. Although it can intrude on cognition and interfere with performance, it can also facilitate information processing and behavioural responses. In a previous study, we showed that anxiety induced by threat of shock facilitates performance on the Sustained Attention to Response Task, a vigilance test, which probes response inhibition to infrequent nogo stimuli. The present study sought to identify factors that may have contributed to such improved performance, including on- and off-task thinking (assessed with thought probes) and individual differences in attention control, as measured with the Attention Control Scale. Replicating our prior finding, we showed that shock threat significantly reduced errors of commission on the nogo trials. However, we extended this finding in demonstrating that this effect was driven by subjects with low attention control. We therefore confirm that anxiety increases inhibitory control of prepotent responses--a mechanism which is adaptive under threat--and show that this effect is greater in those who rely more upon such prepotent responding, i.e., those with low attentional control.
27569741<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Sustained visual attention for competing emotional stimuli in social anxiety: An eye tracking study.<<>>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Numerous studies have supported attentional biases toward social threats in socially anxious individuals. The aim of the present study was to investigate the time-course of sustained attention for multiple emotional stimuli using a free-viewing paradigm in social anxiety. METHODS: Thirty-two socially anxious (SA) and 30 non-anxious (NA) participants completed the free-viewing task. Participants were presented with a face array composed of angry, sad, happy and neutral faces for 10 s in each trial. Eye movements were recorded throughout the trial to assess the time-course of attentional processing. RESULTS: Although SA participants did not exhibit initial orienting bias, they had higher fixation probability for angry faces during the 250-1000 ms time intervals, relative to NA participants. SA participants also maintained their attention longer than NA participants did when angry faces were initially fixated upon. Moreover, NA participants showed higher fixation probability for happy faces during the 6-8 s after stimulus onset. We failed to observe attentional avoidance of threat in SA participants. LIMITATIONS: First, this study used a non-clinical sample. Second, the stimuli used in this study were static. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that, relative to non-anxious individuals, socially anxious individuals are characterized by enhanced engagement with social threat at an early stage of processing and difficulty in disengaging from social threat once their initial attention is located on it. Conversely, non-anxious individuals are characterized by enhanced engagement with positive stimuli at a later stage of processing.
27233238<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Outwitting dengue threat and epidemics resurgence in Asia-Pacific countries: strengthening integrated dengue surveillance, monitoring and response systems.<<>>Dengue is still a substantial vector-borne viral disease threat and burden of public health importance worldwide. This situation is complicated by dengue virus unprecedented resurgence and persistence of varied serotypes in endemic-prone areas, and man-made and natural activities consequences that promote vector emergence, transmission dynamics and spread across the Asia-Pacific region. There is an urgent need to strengthen operational and contextual surveillance-response research in improving early detection of active reservoir detection, novel drug in case management and quality evidence-based response including the deployment of dengue mass vaccination. Moreover, sustained mapping and watching of dengue risk factors or determinants, performance and outcome indicators of control or elimination programs effectiveness in defining minimum effective data towards community knowledge-based decision-making policy and effective response packages is imperative. Moreover, implementation of a robust, integrated dengue early warning surveillance, monitoring and response systems metrics is required for evidence-based, timely and cost-effective contextual mitigation strategies, and innovative interventions.
23620193<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Dwelling on potential threat cues: an eye movement marker for combat-related PTSD.<<>>BACKGROUND: Although several studies have documented an attentional bias toward threat in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the nature of this bias has not been clearly delineated. The present study utilized eye tracking technology to delineate the time course and components of attentional bias for threat cues in combat-related PTSD. METHODS: Veterans with PTSD (n = 21), combat-exposed veterans without PTSD (n = 16), and nonveteran controls (n = 21) viewed emotional expressions (fearful, disgusted, happy) paired with neutral expressions for 3 s presentations. RESULTS: Veterans with PTSD maintained attention longer on the fearful and disgusted expressions relative to the happy expression. This negativity bias was sustained over the course of the 3 s trials, and robustly distinguished veterans with PTSD from both veterans without PTSD and nonveteran controls. CONCLUSIONS: Dwelling on potential threat cues may reflect current PTSD symptoms, or it could reflect a cognitive vulnerability factor for PTSD.
17543892<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Fear-potentiated startle to threat, and prepulse inhibition among young adult nonsmokers, abstinent smokers, and nonabstinent smokers.<<>>BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that the transition from experimental to regular smoking is facilitated by the influence of tobacco on affective and attentional mechanisms. The objective of this study was to examine affective and attentional responses in young adult smokers using fear-potentiated startle and prepulse inhibition. METHODS: Participants were 56 college nonsmokers, nonabstinent smokers, and overnight-abstinent smokers. The fear-potentiated startle test examined phasic responses to imminent threat cues and more sustained responses to unpredictable aversive events. Prepulse inhibition investigated responses to attended and ignored prepulse stimuli. RESULTS: Abstinent and nonabstinent smokers showed increased sustained potentiation of startle to contextual cues, compared to controls. Abstinent smokers showed increased fear-potentiated startle to threat cues, compared to nonsmokers. PPI did not discriminate between abstinent or nonabstinent smokers and controls. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that negative affectivity or anxiety is associated with smoking, particularly during short withdrawal. Potentiated startle may provide a valuable tool in understanding the biologic mechanisms underlying nicotine withdrawal and inform cessation and prevention efforts.
24913111<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>The impact of selected preparations of trace elements - magnesium, potassium, calcium, and zinc on the release of diclofenac sodium from enteric coated tablets and from sustained release capsules.<<>>BACKGROUND: In an aging society, many patients require long-term treatment. This fact is associated clearly with the simultaneous occurrence of lifestyle diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and even osteoarthritis. Concomitant medications, which are a common practice, pose a major threat of an interaction between these drugs. Very popular now "fast way of life" that makes people have less and less time to prepare well-balanced meals of high nutritional value. The result of this lifestyle is an increased need for supplementation preparations necessary vitamins and minerals. Given the wide availability of dietary supplements (shops, kiosks, petrol stations) raises the question about the possibility of an interaction between the uncontrolled intake of dietary supplements and medications received in the most common diseases of civilization. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the most important minerals (magnesium, potassium, calcium, zinc) contained in the popular nutritional supplements, the release also often used as an anti-pain, anti-inflammatory, diclofenac sodium from the different formulations. RESULTS: Among the many as sodium diclofenac selected two most common: film-coated tablets and sustained release capsules. The study showed a significant effect of minerals on the release of diclofenac sodium and differences that impact, depending on the test form of the drug.
20718665<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>The dengue threat to the United States.<<>>Over the past 3 decades, dengue has spread rapidly and has emerged as one of the world's most common mosquitoborne viral diseases. Although often found in tropical and semitropical areas, dengue is capable of being transmitted in temperate climates as well. Dengue is currently endemic to Mexico, most other Latin American countries, and parts of the Caribbean, and it has the potential to become reestablished as an endemic disease in the United States. In fact, sustained transmission of dengue has occurred in Florida within the past year. Conditions exist in the U.S. that could facilitate sustained dengue transmission, including environmental factors, competent mosquito vectors, limited vector and dengue surveillance, increased domestic outdoor daytime activities in warmer months, and low public awareness of the disease. If dengue were to be reestablished in the U.S., it could have significant medical, public health, and economic consequences for the country. The impact of dengue as a public health threat could be lessened through enhanced awareness and reporting of cases, increased support for vector surveillance and control programs, and a greater focus on vaccine development.
30364432<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Push scooter-related injuries in adults: an underestimated threat? Two decades analysed by an emergency department in the capital of Switzerland.<<>>Background: The number of people conducting cycling and skating sports in Switzerland is rising; likewise, we notice an increase in patients visiting our emergency department for adults due to push scooter accidents. In 2001, our emergency department published the first article worldwide on push scooter-related injuries. Nearly two decades later, we want to review the interim period-collect data, compare it with other studies and evaluate the current impact of push scooter accidents in our adult patient population. Objective: To investigate data on the incidence, severity, treatment and approximate costs of push scooter-related injuries in adults who presented to our emergency department from 2000 to 2017. Materials and methods: For this descriptive retrospective study, data were collected in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Inselspital (University Hospital), Berne, Switzerland, from October 2000 to September 2017. We used two clinical reporting systems during that period: Qualicare from 2000 to April 2012 and Ecare from May 2012 to 2017. Results: 165 patients were included, aged 16-80 years. The accidents were mainly classified as unspecified falls in 139 cases (84.24%). 21 patients (12.73%) were wearing a helmet at the time of the accident, while the remaining 144 (87.27%) were not. The most common injuries suffered were fractures in 73 patients (44.24%). 92 patients (55.76%) sustained an impact to the head. The most common treatment was surgery in the operating theatre (59 patients, 35.76%). The mean total cost per case was SFr7566.65 (emergency room visit, hospital stay and outpatient controls for the initial case). Conclusion: The incidence of push scooter-related injuries in adults in our patient population is small but rising. Nevertheless, the resulting injuries are potentially life-threatening and can lead to persistent medical impairment.
26486619<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Canine Rabies: A Looming Threat to Public Health.<<>>Rabies is an acute, fatal viral disease that infects domestic and wild animals and is transmissible to humans. Worldwide, rabies kills over 55,000 people every year. The domestic dog plays a pivotal role in rabies transmission. Domestic dogs are not only part of our daily lives but also of our immediate surroundings, and this is reflected in the rise in pet dog ownership in developed and developing countries. This is important given that more frequent exposures and interactions at the animal-human interface increases the likelihood of contracting zoonotic diseases of companion animals. Despite existing vaccines and post-exposure prophylactic treatment, rabies remains a neglected disease that is poorly controlled throughout much of the developing world, particularly Africa and Asia, where most human rabies deaths occur. It is believed that with sustained international commitments, global elimination of rabies from domestic dog populations, the most dangerous vector to humans, is a realistic goal.
27488625<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Contributions of the Central Extended Amygdala to Fear and Anxiety.<<>>It is widely thought that phasic and sustained responses to threat reflect dissociable circuits centered on the central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), the two major subdivisions of the central extended amygdala. Early versions of this hypothesis remain highly influential and have been incorporated into the National Institute of Mental Health Research Research Domain Criteria framework. However, new observations encourage a different perspective. Anatomical studies show that the Ce and BST form a tightly interconnected unit, where different kinds of threat-relevant information can be integrated and used to assemble states of fear and anxiety. Imaging studies in humans and monkeys show that the Ce and BST exhibit similar functional profiles. Both regions are sensitive to a range of aversive challenges, including uncertain or temporally remote threat; both covary with concurrent signs and symptoms of fear and anxiety; both show phasic responses to short-lived threat; and both show heightened activity during sustained exposure to diffusely threatening contexts. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that both regions can control the expression of fear and anxiety during sustained exposure to diffuse threat. These observations compel a reconsideration of the central extended amygdala's contributions to fear and anxiety and its role in neuropsychiatric disease.
28654085<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>The increasing threat to stratospheric ozone from dichloromethane.<<>>It is well established that anthropogenic chlorine-containing chemicals contribute to ozone layer depletion. The successful implementation of the Montreal Protocol has led to reductions in the atmospheric concentration of many ozone-depleting gases, such as chlorofluorocarbons. As a consequence, stratospheric chlorine levels are declining and ozone is projected to return to levels observed pre-1980 later this century. However, recent observations show the atmospheric concentration of dichloromethane-an ozone-depleting gas not controlled by the Montreal Protocol-is increasing rapidly. Using atmospheric model simulations, we show that although currently modest, the impact of dichloromethane on ozone has increased markedly in recent years and if these increases continue into the future, the return of Antarctic ozone to pre-1980 levels could be substantially delayed. Sustained growth in dichloromethane would therefore offset some of the gains achieved by the Montreal Protocol, further delaying recovery of Earth's ozone layer.
29447069<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>After Aylan Kurdi: How Tweeting About Death, Threat, and Harm Predict Increased Expressions of Solidarity With Refugees Over Time.<<>>Viral social media content has been heralded for its power to transform policy, but online responses are often derided as "slacktivism." This raises the questions of what drives viral communications and what is their effect on support for social change. We addressed these issues in relation to Twitter discussions about Aylan Kurdi, a child refugee who died en route to the European Union. We developed a longitudinal paradigm to analyze 41,253 tweets posted 1 week before the images of Aylan Kurdi emerged, the week they emerged, and 10 weeks afterward-at the time of the Paris terror attacks. Tweeting about death before the images emerged predicted tweeting about Aylan Kurdi, and this, sustained by discussion of harm and threat, predicted the expression of solidarity with refugees 10 weeks later. Results suggest that processes of normative conflict and communication can be intertwined in promoting support for social change.
30507228<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Towards personalized, brain-based behavioral intervention for transdiagnostic anxiety: Transient neural responses to negative images predict outcomes following a targeted computer-based intervention.<<>>OBJECTIVE: Clinical anxiety is prevalent, highly comorbid with other conditions, and associated with significant medical morbidity, disability, and public health burden. Excessive attentional deployment toward threat is a transdiagnostic dimension of anxiety seen at both initial and sustained stages of threat processing. However, group-level observations of these phenomena mask considerable within-group heterogeneity that has been linked to treatment outcomes, suggesting that a transdiagnostic, individual differences approach may capture critical, clinically relevant information. METHOD: Seventy clinically anxious individuals were randomized to receive 8 sessions of attention bias modification (ABM; n = 41 included in analysis), a computer-based mechanistic intervention that specifically targets initial stages of threat processing, or a sham control (n = 21). Participants completed a mixed block/event-related functional MRI task optimized to discriminate transient from sustained neural responses to threat. RESULTS: Larger transient responses across a wide range of cognitive-affective regions (e.g., ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala) predicted better clinical outcomes following ABM, in both a priori anatomical regions and whole-brain analyses; sustained responses did not. A spatial pattern recognition algorithm using transient threat responses successfully discriminated the top quartile of ABM responders with 68% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Neural alterations occurring on the relatively transient timescale that is specifically targeted by ABM predict favorable clinical outcomes. Results inform how to expand on the initial promise of neurocognitive treatments like ABM by fine-tuning their clinical indications (e.g., through personalized mechanistic intervention relevant across diagnoses) and by increasing the range of mechanisms that can be targeted (e.g., through synergistic treatment combinations and/or novel neurocognitive training protocols designed to tackle identified predictors of nonresponse).

28789571<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Threat, Pressure, and Communication About Concussion Safety: Implications for Parent Concussion Education.<<>>BACKGROUND: Parental communication about the importance of reporting concussion symptoms can influence a child's attitudes about such reporting, and is likely related to perceived threat of concussion. However, parental investment in child sport achievement might impede this communication. PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between perceived threat of concussion and parent-child communication regarding concussion symptom reporting, and the potential interaction with parental pressure regarding child sport achievement. METHOD: A total of 236 parents of youth soccer players completed an anonymous online survey. RESULTS: There were greater odds of encouraging concussion reporting among parents who perceived that their child had a greater likelihood of sustaining a concussion ( OR = 1.03, 95% CI [1.01, 1.04]) and lower odds among parents who exhibited greater parental sport pressure ( OR = 0.88, 95% CI [0.78, 0.99]). Parents whose child had a prior concussion were much more likely to communicate with their child about concussion reporting ( OR = 7.86, 95% CI [3.00, 20.55]). CONCLUSION: Initiatives are needed to support healthy sport parenting, particularly focusing on parental encouragement of concussion reporting. Possible directions for concussion education for parents based on the results of this study include providing parents with concrete guidance about the important role they can play in encouraging their child to report symptoms of a concussion, communicating the athletic consequences of continued sport involvement while experiencing symptoms of a concussion, and using narrative messaging with exemplars to personalize the information for parents of youth who have not previously sustained a concussion.
28840198<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Biobehavioral Mechanisms of Mindfulness as a Treatment for Chronic Stress: An RDoC Perspective.<<>>Mindfulness-based interventions have been heralded as promising means of alleviating chronic stress. While meta-analyses indicate that mindfulness-based interventions significantly reduce global measures of stress, how mindfulness-based interventions modulate the specific mechanisms underpinning chronic stress as operationalized by the National Institute of Mental Health research domain criteria (RDoC) of sustained threat has not yet been detailed in the literature. To address this knowledge gap, this article aims to (1) review evidence that mindfulness-based interventions ameliorate each of the 10 elements of behavioral dysregulation characterizing sustained threat via an array of mindful counter-regulatory strategies; (2) review evidence that mindfulness-based interventions modify biological domains implicated in sustained threat, such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, as well as brain circuits involved in attentional function, limbic reactivity, habit behavior, and the default mode network; and (3) integrate these findings into a novel conceptual framework of mindful self-regulation in the face of stress-the Mindfulness-to-Meaning Theory. Taken together, the extant body of scientific evidence suggests that the practice of mindfulness enhances a range biobehavioral factors implicated in adaptive stress coping and induces self-referential plasticity, leading to the ability to find meaning in adversity. These mechanistic findings can inform the treatment development process to optimize the next generation of mindfulness-based interventions for greater therapeutic efficacy.
28938184<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Preliminary evidence that reactivity to uncertain threat is an endophenotype for alcohol use disorder.<<>>BACKGROUND: Having an exaggerated reactivity to threats that are uncertain (U-threat) may facilitate the initiation and maintenance of excessive alcohol use in some individuals. This abnormality may not just be a concomitant for alcohol use disorder (AUD), but also an endophenotype for AUD. METHOD: The aim of the current study was therefore to provide a preliminary test of whether U-threat is an endophenotype for AUD using several of the endophenotype criteria outlined by Gottesman and Gould (2003). Specifically, the study examined whether heightened U-threat reactivity is evidenced in those with: 1) current AUD; 2) remitted AUD (early and sustained remission examined separately); and 3) at-risk for AUD by virtue of having a positive family history of AUD. Participants (N = 147) completed a well-validated threat-of-shock task and startle eyeblink potentiation was collected as an index of aversive responding. Individuals and all available first-degree family members were diagnosed using structured clinical interviews. RESULTS: Individuals at-risk for AUD, with current AUD, and AUD in remission (both early and sustained) all displayed exaggerated reactivity to U-threat, but not predictable threat, compared with non-AUD controls. Moreover, there were no significant differences between the at-risk and any of the AUD groups indicating that exaggerated reactivity to U-threat is relatively state-independent and present regardless of current AUD disease status. CONCLUSIONS: The findings together highlight that exaggerated reactivity to U-threat may be a promising endophenotype for AUD that can aid in the refinement of mechanistic AUD disease models.
24154494<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Mentha arvensis exhibit better adaptive characters in contrast to Mentha piperita when subjugated to sustained waterlogging stress.<<>>Waterlogging is becoming a critical threat to plants growing in areas prone to flooding. Some plants adapt various morphological and biochemical alterations which are regulated transcriptionally to cope with the situation. A comparative study of waterlogging response in two different varieties of Mentha namely Mentha piperita and Mentha arvensis was performed. M. arvensis showed better response towards waterlogging in comparison to M. piperita. M. arvensis maintained a healthy posture by utilizing its carbohydrate content; also, it showed a flourished vegetative growth under waterlogged condition. Soluble protein, chlorophyll content, relative water content, and nitric oxide scavenging activity were comparatively more salient in M. arvensis during this hypoxia treatment. Lipid peroxidation was less in M. arvensis. M. arvensis also showed vigorous outgrowth of adventitious roots to assist waterlogging tolerance. To further investigate the possible gene transcripts involved in this response, we did cDNA subtraction of waterlogging treated M. piperita and M. arvensis seedlings. cDNA subtraction has identified thirty seven novel putative Expressed Sequence Tags which were further classified functionally. Functional classification revealed that maximum percentage of proteins belonged to hypothetical proteins followed by proteins involved in biosynthesis. Some of the identified ESTs were further quantified for their induced expression in M. arvensis in comparison to M. piperita through quantitative real-time PCR.
29693373<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Fabrication of Self-Healing Hydrogels with On-Demand Antimicrobial Activity and Sustained Biomolecule Release for Infected Skin Regeneration.<<>>Microbial infection has been considered as one of the most critical challenges in bioengineering applications especially in tissue regeneration, which engenders severe threat to public health. Herein, a hydrogel performing properties of rapid self-healing, on-demand antibiosis and controlled cargo release was fabricated by a simple assembly of Fe complex as the cross-linker and hyaluronic acid as the gel network. This hydrogel is able to locally degrade and release Fe(3+) to kill bacteria as needed because of hyaluronidase excreted by surrounding bacteria, resulting in efficient antibacterial activity against different types of bacteria. The sustained release property of certain types of growth factors was also observed from this hydrogel owing to its dense network. Moreover, this hydrogel could repeatedly heal itself in minutes because of the coordination interaction between Fe(3+) and COOH, exhibiting good potential in bioengineering applications on the exposed tissue, where the materials are easily damaged during daily life. When topically applied onto damaged mouse skin with infection of Staphylococcus aureus, the hydrogel is able to inhibit microbial infections, meanwhile promoting cutaneous regeneration, which formed new skin with no inflammation within a 10 day treatment. These results demonstrate the potential application of this self-healing hydrogel for the integrated therapy of antibiosis and tissue regeneration.
29126127<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Conservatism and the neural circuitry of threat: economic conservatism predicts greater amygdala-BNST connectivity during periods of threat vs safety.<<>>Political conservatism is associated with an increased negativity bias, including increased attention and reactivity toward negative and threatening stimuli. Although the human amygdala has been implicated in the response to threatening stimuli, no studies to date have investigated whether conservatism is associated with altered amygdala function toward threat. Furthermore, although an influential theory posits that connectivity between the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is important in initiating the response to sustained or uncertain threat, whether individual differences in conservatism modulate this connectivity is unknown. To test whether conservatism is associated with increased reactivity in neural threat circuitry, we measured participants' self-reported social and economic conservatism and asked them to complete high-resolution fMRI scans while under threat of an unpredictable shock and while safe. We found that economic conservatism predicted greater connectivity between the BNST and a cluster of voxels in the left amygdala during threat vs safety. These results suggest that increased amygdala-BNST connectivity during threat may be a key neural correlate of the enhanced negativity bias found in conservatism.
23601852<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Sustained release formulation of an anti-tuberculosis drug based on para-amino salicylic acid-zinc layered hydroxide nanocomposite.<<>>BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB), is caused by the bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its a threat to humans since centuries. Depending on the type of TB, its treatment can last for 6-24 months which is a major cause for patients non-compliance and treatment failure. Many adverse effects are associated with the currently available TB medicines, and there has been no new anti-tuberculosis drug on the market for more than 50 year, as the drug development is very lengthy and budget consuming process.Development of the biocompatible nano drug delivery systems with the ability to minimize the side effects of the drugs, protection of the drug from enzymatic degradation. And most importantly the drug delivery systems which can deliver the drug at target site would increase the therapeutic efficacy. Nanovehicles with their tendency to release the drug in a sustained manner would result in the bioavalibilty of the drugs in the body for a longer period of time and this would reduce the dosing frequency in drug administration. The biocompatible nanovehicles with the properties like sustained release of drug of the target site, protection of the drug from physio-chemical degradation, reduction in dosing frequency, and prolong bioavailability of drug in the body would result in the shortening of the treatment duration. All of these factors would improve the patient compliance with chemotherapy of TB. RESULT: An anti-tuberculosis drug, 4-amino salicylic acid (4-ASA) was successfully intercalated into the interlamellae of zinc layered hydroxide (ZLH) via direct reaction with zinc oxide suspension. The X-ray diffraction patterns and FTIR analyses indicate that the molecule was successfully intercalated into the ZLH interlayer space with an average basal spacing of 24 A. Furthermore, TGA and DTG results show that the drug 4-ASA is stabilized in the interlayers by electrostatic interaction. The release of 4-ASA from the nanocomposite was found to be in a sustained manner. The nanocomposite treated with normal 3T3 cells shows it reduces cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Sustained release formulation of the nanocomposite, 4-ASA intercalated into zinc layered hydroxides, with its ease of preparation, sustained release of the active and less-toxic to the cell is a step forward for a more patient-friendly chemotherapy of Tuberculosis.
19230621<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Neural and behavioural responses to threat in men with a history of serious violence and schizophrenia or antisocial personality disorder.<<>>BACKGROUND: Contemporary theories and evidence implicate defective emotion regulation in violent behaviour. The two psychiatric illnesses most implicated in violence are schizophrenia and antisocial personality disorder (APD). This study examined behavioural and brain abnormalities in violent men with schizophrenia or APD during anticipatory fear. METHOD: Fifty-three men [14 non-violent healthy controls, 13 with schizophrenia and a history of serious violence (VSZ), 13 with schizophrenia without a history of violence (SZ), 13 with APD and a history of serious violence] underwent blood-oxygenation-level-dependent fMRI during an experiment involving repeated presentations of 'safe' and 'threat of electric shock' conditions and provided ratings of shock anticipation and fear. Schizophrenia patients did not have co-morbid APD. RESULTS: VSZ participants reported the highest, and APD participants the lowest, level of shock anticipation and fear, with intermediate ratings by SZ and healthy participants. The violent, relative to non-violent, groups showed altered activity modulation in occipital and temporal regions, from early to latter parts of threat periods. Additionally, VSZ patients displayed exaggerated whereas APD patients showed attenuated thalamic-striatal activity during latter threat periods. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant activity in occipital and temporal regions when exposed to sustained visual threat cues is associated with a predisposition to violence in both schizophrenia and APD. This common biological deficit, however, appears to arise from dissimilar behavioural mechanisms related to differences in the strength of aversive conditioning and behavioural response to sustained threat cues (enhanced in VSZ; attenuated in APD), also reflected in opposite patterns of alternations in thalamic-striatal activity, in these two disorders.
21684425<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Development of influenza vaccine production capacity by the Government Pharmaceutical Organization of Thailand: addressing the threat of an influenza pandemic.<<>>In 2005, a year after highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks in Thailand, the Thai Government issued a National Strategy Plan for Pandemic Influenza Preparedness, a major objective of which was the domestic production of seasonal influenza vaccine. It was considered that sustained influenza vaccine production was the best guarantee of a pandemic vaccine in the event of a future pandemic. The Government decided to provide funds to establish an industrial-scale influenza vaccine production plant, and gave responsibility for this challenging project to the Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO). In 2007, with support from the World Health Organization (WHO), the GPO started to develop egg-based, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in a renovated pilot plant. In early 2009, during the second year of the project, the GPO turned its attention to develop a pandemic live attenuated influenza vaccine (PLAIV) against the influenza A (H1N1) virus. By December 2010, the H1N1 PLAIV had successfully completed Phase II clinical trials and was awaiting registration approval from the Thai Food and Drug Administration (TFDA). The GPO has also started to develop an H5N2 PLAIV, which is expected to enter clinical trials in January 2011. The next step in 2011 will be the development and clinical evaluation of seasonal LAIV. To meet the needs of the national seasonal influenza vaccination programme, the GPO aims to produce 2 million doses of trivalent IIV in 2012 and progressively increase production to the maximum annual capacity of 10 million doses. This article relates how influenza vaccine production capacity was developed and how major challenges are being met in an expeditious manner, with strong local and global commitment.
29637654<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Exercise decreases defensive responses to unpredictable, but not predictable, threat.<<>>BACKGROUND: Research supports the anxiolytic effect of exercise, but the mechanism underlying this effect is unclear. This study examines the influence of exercise in healthy controls on two distinct defensive states implicated in anxiety disorders: fear, a phasic response to a predictable threat, and anxiety, a sustained response to an unpredictable threat. METHODS: Thirty-four healthy volunteers (17 male, age M = 26.18, SD = 5.6) participated in sessions of exercise (biking at 60-70% of heart rate reserve) and control (biking at 10-20% of heart rate reserve) activity for 30 min, separated by 1 week. Threat responses were measured by eyeblink startle and assessed with the "Neutral-Predictable-Unpredictable threat test," which includes a neutral (N) and two threat conditions, one with predictable (P) and one with unpredictable (U) shock. RESULTS: Results show that exercise versus control activity reduces startle potentiation during unpredictable threat (P = .031), but has no effect on startle potentiation during predictable threat (P = .609). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that exercise reduces defensive response to unpredictable, but not predictable, threat, a dissociation that may help inform clinical indications for this behavioral intervention, as well as provide clues to its underlying neurobehavioral mechanisms.
30083115<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Threat vs. Threat: Attention to Fear-Related Animals and Threatening Faces.<<>>It is generally thought to be adaptive that fear relevant stimuli in the environment can capture and hold our attention; and in psychopathology attentional allocation is thought to be cue-specific. Such hypervigilance toward threatening cues or difficulty to disengage attention from threat has been demonstrated for a variety of stimuli, for example, toward evolutionary prepared animals or toward socially relevant facial expressions. Usually, specific stimuli have been examined in individuals with particular fears (e.g., animals in animal fearful and faces in socially fearful participants). However, different kinds of stimuli are rarely examined in one study. Thus, it is unknown how different categories of threatening stimuli compete for attention and how specific kinds of fears modulate these attentional processes. In this study, we used a free viewing paradigm: pairs of pictures with threat-related content (spiders or angry faces) or neutral content (butterflies or neutral faces) were presented side by side (i.e., spiders and angry faces, angry and neutral faces, spiders and butterflies, butterflies and neutral faces). Eye-movements were recorded while spider fearful, socially anxious, or non-anxious participants viewed the picture pairs. Results generally replicate the finding that unpleasant pictures more effectively capture attention in the beginning of a trial compared to neutral pictures. This effect was more pronounced in spider fearful participants: the higher the fear the quicker they were in looking at spiders. This was not the case for high socially anxious participants and pictures of angry faces. Interestingly, when presented next to each other, there was no preference in initial orientation for either spiders or angry faces. However, neutral faces were looked at more quickly than butterflies. Regarding sustained attention, we found no general preference for unpleasant pictures compared to neutral pictures.
29579136<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Impact of Diagnosis Threat on Neuropsychological Assessment of People with Acquired Brain Injury: Evidence of Mediation by Negative Emotions.<<>>Objective: Some studies have shown that diagnosis threat (DT) could negatively impact the cognitive performance of undergraduate students who had sustained a mild traumatic brain injury. This study was designed to examine DT in people with acquired brain injury (ABI). As a second goal, we investigated the effect of stereotype lift as a way to overcome DT's harmful impact. The purpose of this study was also to examine the mechanisms mediating stereotype effects. Method: People with ABI and control participants were assigned to one of three conditions: DT, cognitive-neutral (in which the cognitive status of participants with ABI and the cognitive characteristics of the tasks were deemphasized), and stereotype lift (in which a downward comparison was made with another neurological group). Participants then completed neuropsychological tasks. Negative emotions, intrusive thoughts, task expectancy, and self-efficacy were assessed for mediation analyses. Results: Instructions impacted the performance of people with ABI, but not control participants. Compared to the cognitive-neutral condition, participants with ABI in the DT condition performed worse on memory and executive tasks (but not on attention tasks). These effects were mediated by negative emotions. There was no increase in performance in the stereotype lift condition compared to the DT condition. Conclusions: This study showed that DT can aggravate the cognitive difficulties of people with ABI during neuropsychological assessment. The mediating role of negative emotions and the selective impact of DT on tasks that rely heavily on executive functioning are discussed in the light of the stereotype threat model.
30605004<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Explicit and Ambiguous Threat Processing: Functionally Dissociable Roles of the Amygdala and Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis.<<>>Highly influential models have proposed that responses to different types of threat are mediated by partially segregated neural systems, with the amygdala underlying phasic responses to explicit threat (fear) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) mediating sustained responses to ambiguous threat (anxiety). However, newer models have suggested similar recruitment of both regions across a wide spectrum of threat. Therefore, to empirically test these models and further elucidate the activation profiles and connectivity patterns of the amygdala and the BNST during threat processing, 20 participants were scanned using high-resolution fMRI (1.5 mm(3)). Using fearful faces and human screams as aversive stimuli, two threat conditions were created: Explicit Threat in which threats were certain and predictable (fear) and Ambiguous Threat in which threats were uncertain and unpredictable (anxiety). Results indicated that, although the amygdala and the BNST both showed heightened engagement across both threat conditions, the amygdala showed preferential engagement during Explicit Threat and displayed functional connectivity with regions involved in stimulus processing and motor response. By contrast, the BNST preferentially responded during Ambiguous Threat and exhibited functional connectivity with prefrontal regions underlying interoception and rumination. Furthermore, correlations with questionnaires measuring trait anxiety, worry, and rumination suggested that individual differences in affective style play a modulatory role in regional recruitment and network connectivity during threat processing.
22511349<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>The NorR regulon is critical for Vibrio cholerae resistance to nitric oxide and sustained colonization of the intestines.<<>>UNLABELLED: Vibrio cholerae, the cause of an often fatal infectious diarrhea, remains a large global public health threat. Little is known about the challenges V. cholerae encounters during colonization of the intestines, which genes are important for overcoming these challenges, and how these genes are regulated. In this study, we examined the V. cholerae response to nitric oxide (NO), an antibacterial molecule derived during infection from various sources, including host inducible NO synthase (iNOS). We demonstrate that the regulatory protein NorR regulates the expression of NO detoxification genes hmpA and nnrS, and that all three are critical for resisting low levels of NO stress under microaerobic conditions in vitro. We also show that prxA, a gene previously thought to be important for NO detoxification, plays no role in NO resistance under microaerobic conditions and is upregulated by H(2)O(2), not NO. Furthermore, in an adult mouse model of prolonged colonization, hmpA and norR were important for the resistance of both iNOS- and non-iNOS-derived stresses. Our data demonstrate that NO detoxification systems play a critical role in the survival of V. cholerae under microaerobic conditions resembling those of an infectious setting and during colonization of the intestines over time periods similar to that of an actual V. cholerae infection. IMPORTANCE: Little is known about what environmental stresses Vibrio cholerae, the etiologic agent of cholera, encounters during infection, and even less is known about how V. cholerae senses and counters these stresses. Most prior studies of V. cholerae infection relied on the 24-h infant mouse model, which does not allow the analysis of survival over time periods comparable to that of an actual V. cholerae infection. In this study, we used a sustained mouse colonization model to identify nitric oxide resistance as a function critical for the survival of V. cholerae in the intestines and further identified the genes responsible for sensing and detoxifying this stress.
29107120<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Inter-individual differences in trait anxiety shape the functional connectivity between the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the amygdala during brief threat processing.<<>>An influential framework suggests that the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is involved in phasic responses to threat, while the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) mediates sustained anxiety. However, this model has been questioned, proposing that the role of the BNST is not limited to sustained threat contexts. Rather, amygdala and BNST also seem to work in concert in the processing of discrete and briefly presented threat-related stimuli, likely dependent on inter-individual differences in anxiety. A direct test of this assumption with sufficient experimental power is missing in human research and the degree to which individual differences in trait anxiety moderate phasic responses and functional connectivity of amygdala and BNST during threat processing remains unclear. The current event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated activation and connectivity of amygdala and BNST, as well as modulating effects of trait anxiety, during processing of briefly presented threat-related relative to neutral standardized pictures in 93 psychiatrically healthy individuals. Both amygdala and BNST activation was increased during presentation of threat-related relative to neutral pictures. Furthermore, functional connectivity between BNST and amygdala in response to threat was positively associated with trait anxiety. These findings suggest that amygdala and BNST form a functional unit during phasic threat processing whereby their connectivity is shaped by inter-individual differences in trait anxiety.
26589772<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Interaction of threat and verbal working memory in adolescents.<<>>Threat induces a state of sustained anxiety that can disrupt cognitive processing, and, reciprocally, cognitive processing can modulate an anxiety response to threat. These effects depend on the level of cognitive engagement, which itself varies as a function of task difficulty. In adults, we recently showed that induced anxiety impaired working memory accuracy at low and medium but not high load. Conversely, increasing the task load reduced the physiological correlates of anxiety (anxiety-potentiated startle). The present work examines such threat-cognition interactions as a function of age. We expected threat to more strongly impact working memory in younger individuals by virtue of putatively restricted cognitive resources and weaker emotion regulation. This was tested by examining the influence of age on the interaction of anxiety and working memory in 25 adolescents (10 to 17 years) and 25 adults (22 to 46 years). Working memory load was manipulated using a verbal n-back task. Anxiety was induced using the threat of an aversive loud scream and measured via eyeblink startle. Findings revealed that, in both age groups, accuracy was lower during threat than safe conditions at low and medium but not high load, and reaction times were faster during threat than safe conditions at high load but did not differ at other loads. Additionally, anxiety-potentiated startle was greater during low and medium than high load. Thus, the interactions of anxiety with working memory appear similar in adolescents and adults. Whether these similarities reflect common neural mechanisms would need to be assessed using functional neuroimaging.
20807057<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Sustained preferential processing of social threat cues: bias without competition?<<>>Stimuli of high emotional significance such as social threat cues are preferentially processed in the human brain. However, there is an ongoing debate whether or not these stimuli capture attention automatically and weaken the processing of concurrent stimuli in the visual field. This study examined continuous fluctuations of electrocortical facilitation during competition of two spatially separated facial expressions in high and low socially anxious individuals. Two facial expressions were flickered for 3000 msec at different frequencies (14 and 17.5 Hz) to separate the electrocortical signals evoked by the competing stimuli ("frequency tagging"). Angry faces compared to happy and neutral expressions were associated with greater electrocortical facilitation over visual areas only in the high socially anxious individuals. This finding was independent of the respective competing stimulus. Heightened electrocortical engagement in socially anxious participants was present in the first second of stimulus viewing and was sustained for the entire presentation period. These results, based on a continuous measure of attentional resource allocation, support the view that stimuli of high personal significance are associated with early and sustained prioritized sensory processing. These cues, however, do not interfere with the electrocortical processing of a spatially separated concurrent face, suggesting that they are effective at capturing attention, but are weak competitors for resources.
25471241<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>One world--one health: the threat of emerging swine diseases. An Asian perspective.<<>>Owing to the expanding globalization, the trans-boundary spread of an epizootic can easily result from uncontrolled animal movements and human traffic. Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is a major trans-boundary disease in most Asian countries. Its sporadic re-emergence suggests that collaborative FMD control strategies should be uniformly implemented in endemic countries to ensure the overall national herd vaccination coverage, biocontainment when outbreaks occur, and strict biosecurity control of animal movement between countries. Sustained commitments from governments, cooperative diplomatic relationships, and public awareness campaigns are critical to FMD control, to ensure collaboration among veterinarians, traders and farmers throughout Southeast Asia (SEA). Recently, highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (HP-PRRS) and porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) spread from China to Southeast Asian countries, causing major economic losses. Foot and mouth disease, HP-PRRS, and PED currently remain endemic and may continue to sporadically re-emerge, owing to inadequate public health management and/or biosecurity failures. Therefore, the risk factors must be identified to better understand the epidemiology of these diseases in an effort to develop effective control measures. International coordination through the establishment of a collaborative network supported by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) should be implemented to prevent trans-boundary transmission among countries. This review discusses trans-boundary swine diseases of particular importance to SEA, including FMD, HP-PRRS and PED, with a primary focus on major factors contributing to the spread of these diseases and important control measures, reflecting the impact of globalization on disease control and surveillance.
27286067<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Organizational resilience: Sustained institutional effectiveness among smaller, private, non-profit US higher education institutions experiencing organizational decline.<<>>BACKGROUND: Recent changes in the United States (US) economy have radically disrupted revenue generation among many institutions within higher education within the US. Chief among these disruptions has been fallout associated with the financial crisis of 2008-2009, which triggered a change in the US higher education environment from a period of relative munificence to a prolonged period of scarcity. The hardest hit by this disruption have been smaller, less wealthy institutions which tend to lack the necessary reserves to financially weather the economic storm. Interestingly, a review of institutional effectiveness among these institutions revealed that while many are struggling, some institutions have found ways to not only successfully cope with the impact of declining revenue, but have been able to capitalize on the disruption and thrive. OBJECTIVE: Organizational response is an important factor in successfully coping with conditions of organizational decline. The study examined the impacts of organizational response on institutional effectiveness among higher education institutions experiencing organizational decline. The study's research question asked why some US higher educational institutions are more resilient at coping with organizational decline than other institutions operating within the same segment of the higher education sector. More specifically, what role does organizational resilience have in helping smaller, private non-profit institutions cope and remain effective during organizational decline? PARTICIPANTS: A total of 141 US smaller, private non-profit higher educational institutions participated in the study; specifically, the study included responses from participant institutions' key administrators. METHODS: 60-item survey evaluated administrator responses corresponding to organizational response and institutional effectiveness. Factor analysis was used to specify the underlying structures of rigidity response, resilience response, and institutional effectiveness. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the direct and interaction effects between organizational decline, organizational rigidity response, organizational resilience response, and institutional effectiveness, controlling for age of institution and level of endowment. RESULTS: The study validated previous threat-rigidity response findings that organizational decline alone does not adversely impact institutional effectiveness. The direct effect of Goal-Directed Solution Seeking and Role Dependency organizational resilience factors had a positive, significant correlation with the Student Personal Development institutional effectiveness factor. The interactive effect of Goal-Directed Solution Seeking organizational resilience factor during organizational decline had a positive, significant correlation with the Professional Development and Quality of Faculty institutional effectiveness factor. The interactive effect of Avoidance during organizational decline had a positive, significant correlation with the Faculty and Administrator Employment Satisfaction institutional effectiveness factor. The interactive effect of Diminished Innovation, Morale, and Leader Credibility rigidity response factor and Avoidance organizational resilience factor during organizational decline had a positive, significant correlation with the Professional Development and Quality of Faculty institutional effectiveness factor. Lastly, the interactive effect of Increased Scapegoating of Leaders, Interest group Activities, and Conflict rigidity response factor and Avoidance organizational resilience factor during organizational decline had a positive, significant correlation with the Faculty and Administrator Employment Satisfaction institutional effectiveness factor. CONCLUSIONS: Factors of organizational resilience were found to have a positive effect among smaller, private non-profit higher educational institutions associated with this study toward sustaining institutional effectiveness during organizational decline. Specifically, the organizational resilience factors of Goal-Directed Solution Seeking (i.e., mission-driven solutions) and Avoidance (i.e., skepticism toward new ideas) play a significant, collaborative role among smaller, private non-profit higher educational institutions when it comes to sustaining institutional effectiveness during organizational decline.
23910874<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Rising threat of terrorist bomb blasts in Karachi--a 5-year study.<<>>OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the frequency of injuries and fatalities associated with terrorist bomb explosions in the city of Karachi from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2011. Moreover, this study is aimed to determine age and sex vulnerability among the victims of blast explosion. STUDY DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted. PLACE: The study was carried out at mortuaries and medicolegal sections at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center, Civil Hospital and Abbasi-Shaheed Hospital Karachi, the three main hospitals, which cater to all these cases of Karachi. DURATION OF STUDY: The study included all bomb blast victims examined and autopsied from January 2007 to December 2011 at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center, Civil Hospital and Abbassi Shaheed Hospital Karachi. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Details of 1142 cases were collected for those medicolegal deaths and injured persons, identified to be the victims of bomb blasts from January 2007 to December 2011. Data were collected on a preformed proforma from the mortuaries and medicolegal sections of these three public sector hospitals. The variables investigated include age, gender, year-wise distribution of the injured and the dead along with the cause of death and body parts injured in survivors. RESULTS: Out of the total 11,109 autopsies during the study period, 249 (2.24%) were carried out on deaths due to bomb blasts. Similarly, 135,065 injury cases were reported during the study period out of which 893 (0.66%) cases were due to bomb blasts. An initial peak in the year 2007, followed by a decline in 2008 and since then a steady rise of bomb blast incidences with casualties and fatalities, has been observed. The highest numbers of injured victims were reported in the year 2010 and fatalities in 2007. Among 1142 cases, 95.18% were male and 4.82% female with a male to female ratio of 19.76:1. Persons of ages between 15 and 45 years were chiefly involved. Shock due to multiple injuries was the leading cause of death, followed by head injury with or without haemorrhage. The lower extremities sustained the highest number of injuries in survivors, followed by the upper extremities. CONCLUSION: Fatalities and casualties due to explosions are increasing each year. The pattern of injuries indicates open-air bombing in Karachi. Males of the age group 15-45 years are the main victims. The forensic speciality needs to understand their role of correct certification, helpful to law enforcement agencies.
26032441<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Modeling outcomes of approaches to sustained human and snow leopard coexistence.<<>>The snow leopard (Uncia uncia) is in danger of extinction. Killing to protect livestock is among the primary causes of its decline. Efforts to mitigate this threat have focused on balancing the need to conserve the snow leopard with the needs of local people in snow leopard habitat, many of whom rely on raising livestock for their livelihoods. Conservation of the snow leopard has the characteristics of a public good, and outside funding is required to support conservation efforts. There are 5 commonly discussed approaches to resolving this issue: (1) direct payments for conservation, (2) investments in protection from predation, (3) damage compensation payments, (4) investments in better livestock husbandry, and (5) leases of pastureland for wild prey. After a review of these 5 conservation strategies, an economic-ecologic model, which includes the interactions between the snow leopard, its wild prey, and livestock, is used to evaluate the 2 most promising conservation strategies. The model reveals that investments in protection from predation and leases of pastureland for wild prey are effective but only in delaying the eventual extinction of the snow leopard. To preserve the snow leopard, these approaches must be applied more aggressively and new ones explored.
19595731<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Selective participation of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and CRF in sustained anxiety-like versus phasic fear-like responses.<<>>The medial division of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA(M)) and the lateral division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST(L)) are closely related. Both receive projections from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and both project to brain areas that mediate fear-influenced behaviors. In contrast to CeA(M) however, initial attempts to implicate the BNST in conditioned fear responses were largely unsuccessful. More recent studies have shown that the BNST does participate in some types of anxiety and stress responses. Here, we review evidence suggesting that the CeA(M) and BNST(L) are functionally complementary, with CeA(M) mediating short- but not long-duration threat responses (i.e., phasic fear) and BNST(L) mediating long- but not short-duration responses (sustained fear or 'anxiety'). We also review findings implicating the stress-related peptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in sustained but not phasic threat responses, and attempt to integrate these findings into a neural circuit model which accounts for these and related observations.
27318217<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Attention mechanisms during predictable and unpredictable threat - A steady-state visual evoked potential approach.<<>>Fear is elicited by imminent threat and leads to phasic fear responses with selective attention, whereas anxiety is characterized by a sustained state of heightened vigilance due to uncertain danger. In the present study, we investigated attention mechanisms in fear and anxiety by adapting the NPU-threat test to measure steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs). We investigated ssVEPs across no aversive events (N), predictable aversive events (P), and unpredictable aversive events (U), signaled by four-object arrays (30s). In addition, central cues were presented during all conditions but predictably signaled imminent threat only during the P condition. Importantly, cues and context events were flickered at different frequencies (15Hz vs. 20Hz) in order to disentangle respective electrocortical responses. The onset of the context elicited larger electrocortical responses for U compared to P context. Conversely, P cues elicited larger electrocortical responses compared to N cues. Interestingly, during the presence of the P cue, visuocortical processing of the concurrent context was also enhanced. The results support the notion of enhanced initial hypervigilance to unpredictable compared to predictable threat contexts, while predictable cues show electrocortical enhancement of the cues themselves but additionally a boost of context processing.
27036648<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Prepare for scare-Impact of threat predictability on affective visual processing in spider phobia.<<>>The visual processing of emotional faces is influenced by individual's level of stress and anxiety. Valence unspecific affective processing is expected to be influenced by predictability of threat. Using a design of phasic fear (predictable threat), sustained anxiety (unpredictable threat) and safety (no threat), we investigated the magnetoencephalographic correlates and temporal dynamics of emotional face processing in a sample of phobic patients. Compared to non-anxious controls, phobic individuals revealed decreased parietal emotional attention processes during affective processing at mid-latency and late processing stages. While control subjects showed increasing parietal processing of the facial stimuli in line with decreasing threat predictability, phobic subjects revealed the opposite pattern. Decreasing threat predictability also led to increasing neural activity in the orbitofrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at mid-latency stages. Additionally, unpredictability of threat lead to higher subjective discomfort compared to predictability of threat and no threat safety condition. Our findings indicate that visual processing of emotional information is influenced by both stress induction and pathologic anxiety.
29409740<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Regulation of threat in post-traumatic stress disorder: Associations between inhibitory control and dissociative symptoms.<<>>The current study investigated links between trauma exposure, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and inhibitory control assessed using a modified version of the visual flanker task. The study had three aims: (1) specifically confirm general non-affective deficits in sustained attention in PTSD; (2) probe the influence of threatening and trauma-related stimuli on inhibitory control; and (3) explore neural correlates connecting PTSD, facets of dissociation, and inhibitory control. Participants with PTSD (n=16), trauma-exposed individuals without PTSD (TE; n=14), and healthy controls (n=15) discriminated line orientations while ignoring temporally flanking lines and images depicting threatening or non-threatening scenes or faces. Electrophysiological recordings were made during task performance. Relative to TE participants, PTSD participants had poor sustained non-affective attention, but nevertheless exhibited greater inhibition of distractors (i.e., high event-related potential [ERP] Rejection Positivity [RP]) to threatening (versus non-threatening) stimuli. RP was associated with greater self-reported depersonalization in PTSD participants, but with less depersonalization in TE participants. Dipole source analysis localized RP to the posterior cingulate cortex in both PTSD and TE (and healthy controls), but with an additional source in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in TE, components of the default mode network. Results suggest a paradox in the executive control of distraction in PTSD: Whereas individuals with PTSD experience a general impairment in non-affective inhibitory control, their enhanced control of threat is associated with more severe symptoms of dissociation.
29213110<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>The relationship between dlPFC activity during unpredictable threat and CO2-induced panic symptoms.<<>>Panic disorder is characterized by sudden, repeated, and unexpected attacks of intense fear and overwhelming anxiety about when another attack may strike. Patients with panic disorder and healthy individuals with a history of panic attacks show a hypersensitivity to unpredictable threats, suggesting a possible link between panic and sustained anxiety. The purpose of this study was to determine the degree to which induced symptoms of panic relate to fear and anxiety, as well as activity in the neural systems that mediate and regulate these affective states. Psychological and physiological symptoms of panic were assessed during an 8-min 7.5% CO2 challenge task. Psychological, physiological, and neural symptoms of fear and anxiety were measured during two sessions (one psychophysiology and one functional magnetic resonance imaging where subjects experienced several blocks of no threat (N), predictable shock (P), and unpredictable shock (U; NPU threat task). We used a principle component analysis to characterize panic susceptibility (PS), and found that PS significantly predicted dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) activity to the unpredictable cue during the NPU threat task. When examining the weighted beta coefficients from this analysis, we observed that self-reported fear/anxiety during the CO2 challenge negatively loaded onto dlPFC activity during the NPU task. Consistent with this observation, dlPFC activity during the unpredictable cue was also negatively correlated with anxiety during the NPU sessions. Together, these results suggest that panic symptoms and anxiety are regulated by the same prefrontal cognitive control system.
25902716<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Characterization of imported malaria, the largest threat to sustained malaria elimination from Sri Lanka.<<>>Sri Lanka has reached zero indigenous malaria cases in November 2012, two years before its targeted deadline for elimination. Currently, the biggest threat to the elimination efforts are the risk of resurgence of malaria due to imported cases. This paper describes two clusters of imported malaria infections reported in 2013 and 2014, one among a group of Pakistani asylum-seekers resident in Sri Lanka, and the other amongst local fishermen who returned from Sierra Leone. The two clusters studied reveal the potential impact of imported malaria on the risk of reintroducing the disease, as importation is the only source of malaria in the country at present. In the event of a case occurring, detection is a major challenge both amongst individuals returning from malaria endemic countries and the local population, as malaria is fast becoming a "forgotten" disease amongst health care providers. In spite of a very good coverage of diagnostic services (microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests) throughout the country, malaria is being repeatedly overlooked by health care providers even when individuals present with fever and a recent history of travel to a malaria endemic country. Given the high receptivity to malaria in previously endemic areas of the country due to the prevalence of the vector mosquito, such cases pose a significant threat for the reintroduction of malaria to Sri Lanka. The challenges faced by the Anti Malaria Campaign and measures taken to prevent the resurgence of malaria are discussed here.
30877121<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Swine-Origin H1 Influenza Viruses Isolated from Humans Exhibit Sustained Infectivity in an Aerosol State.<<>>The relative importance of influenza virus transmission via aerosols is not fully understood, but experimental data suggest that aerosol transmission may represent a critical mode of influenza virus spread among humans. Decades ago, prototypical laboratory strains of influenza were shown to persist in aerosols; however, there is a paucity of data available covering currently circulating influenza viruses, which differ significantly from their predecessors. In this study, we evaluated the longevity of influenza viruses in aerosols generated in the laboratory. We selected a panel of H1 viruses that exhibit diverse transmission profiles in the ferret model, including four human isolates of swine origin (referred to as variant) and a seasonal strain. By measuring the ratio of viral RNA to infectious virus maintained in aerosols over time, we show that influenza viruses known to transmit efficiently through the air display enhanced stability in an aerosol state for prolonged periods compared to those viruses that do not transmit as efficiently. We then assessed whether H1 influenza virus was still capable of infecting and causing disease in ferrets after being aged in suspended aerosols. Ferrets exposed to very low levels of influenza virus (</=17 PFU) in aerosols aged for 15 or 30 min became infected, with five of six ferrets shedding virus in nasal washes at titers on par with ferrets who inhaled higher doses of unaged influenza virus. We describe here an underreported characteristic of influenza viruses, stability in aerosols, and make a direct connection to the role this characteristic plays in influenza transmission.IMPORTANCE Each time a swine influenza virus transmits to a human, it provides an opportunity for the virus to acquire adaptations needed for sustained human-to-human transmission. Here, we use aerobiology techniques to test the stability of swine-origin H1 subtype viruses in aerosols and evaluate their infectivity in ferrets. Our results show that highly transmissible influenza viruses display enhanced stability in an aerosol state compared to viruses that do not transmit as efficiently. Similar to human-adapted strains, swine-origin influenza viruses are infectious in ferrets at low doses even after prolonged suspension in the air. These data underscore the risk of airborne swine-origin influenza viruses and support the need for continued surveillance and refinement of innovative laboratory methods to investigate mammalian exposure to inhaled pathogens. Determination of the molecular markers that affect the longevity of airborne influenza viruses will improve our ability to quickly identify emerging strains that present the greatest threat to public health.
30267020<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Excitability regulation in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex during sustained instructed fear responses: a TMS-EEG study.<<>>Threat detection is essential for protecting individuals from adverse situations, in which a network of amygdala, limbic regions and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) regions are involved in fear processing. Excitability regulation in the dmPFC might be crucial for fear processing, while abnormal patterns could lead to mental illness. Notwithstanding, non-invasive paradigms to measure excitability regulation during fear processing in humans are missing. To address this challenge we adapted an approach for excitability characterization, combining electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the dmPFC during an instructed fear paradigm, to dynamically dissect its role in fear processing. Event-related (ERP) and TMS-evoked potentials (TEP) were analyzed to trace dmPFC excitability. We further linked the excitability regulation patterns to individual MRI-derived gray matter structural integrity of the fear network. Increased cortical excitability was demonstrated to threat (T) processing in comparison to no-threat (NT), reflected by increased amplitude of evoked potentials. Furthermore, TMS at dmPFC enhanced the evoked responses during T processing, while the structural integrity of the dmPFC and amygdala predicted the excitability regulation patterns to fear processing. The dmPFC takes a special role during fear processing by dynamically regulating excitability. The applied paradigm can be used to non-invasively track response abnormalities to threat stimuli in healthy subjects or patients with mental disorders.
21252312<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Emotion blocks the path to learning under stereotype threat.<<>>Gender-based stereotypes undermine females' performance on challenging math tests, but how do they influence their ability to learn from the errors they make? Females under stereotype threat or non-threat were presented with accuracy feedback after each problem on a GRE-like math test, followed by an optional interactive tutorial that provided step-wise problem-solving instruction. Event-related potentials tracked the initial detection of the negative feedback following errors [feedback related negativity (FRN), P3a], as well as any subsequent sustained attention/arousal to that information [late positive potential (LPP)]. Learning was defined as success in applying tutorial information to correction of initial test errors on a surprise retest 24-h later. Under non-threat conditions, emotional responses to negative feedback did not curtail exploration of the tutor, and the amount of tutor exploration predicted learning success. In the stereotype threat condition, however, greater initial salience of the failure (FRN) predicted less exploration of the tutor, and sustained attention to the negative feedback (LPP) predicted poor learning from what was explored. Thus, under stereotype threat, emotional responses to negative feedback predicted both disengagement from learning and interference with learning attempts. We discuss the importance of emotion regulation in successful rebound from failure for stigmatized groups in stereotype-salient environments.
28811112<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Exogenous testosterone affects early threat processing in socially anxious and healthy women.<<>>Testosterone plays an important role in social threat processing. Recent evidence suggests that testosterone administration has socially anxiolytic effects, but it remains unknown whether this involves early vigilance or later, more sustained, processing-stages. We investigated the acute effects of testosterone administration on social threat processing in 19 female patients with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and 19 healthy controls. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during an emotional Stroop task with subliminally presented faces. Testosterone induced qualitative changes in early ERPs (<200ms after stimulus onset) in both groups. An initial testosterone-induced spatial shift reflected a change in the basic processing (N170/VPP) of neutral faces, which was followed by a shift for angry faces suggesting a decrease in early threat bias. These findings suggest that testosterone specifically affects early automatic social information processing. The decreased attentional bias for angry faces explains how testosterone can decrease threat avoidance, which is particularly relevant for SAD.
27462211<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) of the Right Inferior Frontal Gyrus Attenuates Skin Conductance Responses to Unpredictable Threat Conditions.<<>>Patients with panic and post-traumatic stress disorders seem to show increased psychophysiological reactions to conditions of unpredictable (U) threat, which has been discussed as a neurobiological marker of elevated levels of sustained fear in these disorders. Interestingly, a recent study found that the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) is correlated to the successful regulation of sustained fear during U threat. Therefore this study aimed to examine the potential use of non-invasive brain stimulation to foster the rIFG by means of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in order to reduce psychophysiological reactions to U threat. Twenty six participants were randomly assigned into an anodal and sham stimulation group in a double-blinded manner. Anodal and cathodal electrodes (7 * 5 cm) were positioned right frontal to target the rIFG. Stimulation intensity was I = 2 mA applied for 20 min during a task including U threat conditions (NPU-task). The effects of the NPU paradigm were measured by assessing the emotional startle modulation and the skin conductance response (SCR) at the outset of the different conditions. We found a significant interaction effect of condition x tDCS for the SCR (F (2,48) = 6.3, p < 0.01) without main effects of condition and tDCS. Post hoc tests revealed that the increase in SCR from neutral (N) to U condition was significantly reduced in verum compared to the sham tDCS group (t (24) = 3.84, p < 0.001). Our results emphasize the causal role of rIFG for emotional regulation and the potential use of tDCS to reduce apprehension during U threat conditions and therefore as a treatment for anxiety disorders.
19078950<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Differential effects of the CRF-R1 antagonist GSK876008 on fear-potentiated, light- and CRF-enhanced startle suggest preferential involvement in sustained vs phasic threat responses.<<>>The amplitude of the acoustic startle response is increased when elicited in the presence of brief cues that predict shock (fear-potentiated startle) and also when elicited during sustained exposure to bright light (light-enhanced startle). Although both effects are thought to reflect fear or anxiety, their neuroanatomical substrates differ. Although fear-potentiated startle is disrupted by reversible inactivation of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) but not the closely related bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), light-enhanced startle is disrupted by BNST inactivation but not by CeA inactivation. Intraventricular infusions of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) also increase startle (CRF-enhanced startle) and this effect is mediated by CRF receptors within the BNST, with no involvement of the CeA. Together, these observations suggest that CeA- and BNST-dependent fear and anxiety may be differentially sensitive to CRF receptor blockade. We tested this by orally administering the novel, potent, and selective CRF-R1 antagonist GSK876008 to rats before CRF-enhanced, light-enhanced, or fear-potentiated startle testing. GSK876008 disrupted CRF-enhanced startle with a linear dose-response curve, and light-enhanced startle with a U-shaped dose-response curve, but did not disrupt fear-potentiated startle to a visual stimulus at any dose tested, and even augmented the response in some animals. GSK876008 also disrupted shock-related 'baseline' startle increases, which may have reflected context conditioning (shown elsewhere to also be BNST-dependent). Overall, these results suggest that short-duration CeA-dependent threat responses can be pharmacologically dissociated from longer duration BNST-dependent responses in terms of their sensitivity to CRF1 receptor antagonists.
28387654<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030: Scientific Developments from the 2016 INTEREST Conference in Yaounde, Cameroon.<<>>The underpinning theme of the 2016 INTEREST Conference held in Yaounde, Cameroon, 3-6 May 2016 was ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. Focused primarily on HIV treatment, pathogenesis and prevention research in resource-limited settings, the conference attracted 369 active delegates from 34 countries, of which 22 were in Africa. Presentations on treatment optimization, acquired drug resistance, care of children and adolescents, laboratory monitoring and diagnostics, implementation challenges, HIV prevention, key populations, vaccine and cure, hepatitis C, mHealth, financing the HIV response and emerging pathogens, were accompanied by oral, mini-oral and poster presentations. Spirited plenary debates on the UNAIDS 90-90-90 treatment cascade goal and on antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis took place. Joep Lange career guidance sessions and grantspersonship sessions attracted early career researchers. At the closing ceremony, the Yaounde Declaration called on African governments; UNAIDS; development, bilateral, and multilateral partners; and civil society to adopt urgent and sustained approaches to end HIV by 2030.
25486680<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Chikungunya virus: is this the next emerging disease threat to the americas?<<>>Chikungunya fever is a mosquito-borne infection for which no cure or vaccine is available. It made its first appearance in the Americas in December 2013. Seven months later, two locally acquired cases of the disease emerged in the United States. The emergence of chikungunya fever cases in the Americas emphasizes the need for sustained vector control, clear public health information, and disease awareness and surveillance.
28223481<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Sustained disruption of narwhal habitat use and behavior in the presence of Arctic killer whales.<<>>Although predators influence behavior of prey, analyses of electronic tracking data in marine environments rarely consider how predators affect the behavior of tracked animals. We collected an unprecedented dataset by synchronously tracking predator (killer whales, [Formula: see text] = 1; representing a family group) and prey (narwhal, [Formula: see text] = 7) via satellite telemetry in Admiralty Inlet, a large fjord in the Eastern Canadian Arctic. Analyzing the movement data with a switching-state space model and a series of mixed effects models, we show that the presence of killer whales strongly alters the behavior and distribution of narwhal. When killer whales were present (within about 100 km), narwhal moved closer to shore, where they were presumably less vulnerable. Under predation threat, narwhal movement patterns were more likely to be transiting, whereas in the absence of threat, more likely resident. Effects extended beyond discrete predatory events and persisted steadily for 10 d, the duration that killer whales remained in Admiralty Inlet. Our findings have two key consequences. First, given current reductions in sea ice and increases in Arctic killer whale sightings, killer whales have the potential to reshape Arctic marine mammal distributions and behavior. Second and of more general importance, predators have the potential to strongly affect movement behavior of tracked marine animals. Understanding predator effects may be as or more important than relating movement behavior to resource distribution or bottom-up drivers traditionally included in analyses of marine animal tracking data.
30984769<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Prairie Dogs, Persistent Plague, Flocking Fleas, and Pernicious Positive Feedback.<<>>Plague (caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis) is a deadly flea-borne disease that remains a threat to public health nearly worldwide and is particularly disruptive ecologically where it has been introduced. We review hypotheses regarding maintenance and transmission of Y. pestis, emphasizing recent data from North America supporting maintenance by persistent transmission that results in sustained non-epizootic (but variable) rates of mortality in hosts. This maintenance mechanism may facilitate periodic epizootic eruptions "in place" because the need for repeated reinvasion from disjunct sources is eliminated. Resulting explosive outbreaks that spread rapidly in time and space are likely enhanced by synergistic positive feedback (PFB) cycles involving flea vectors, hosts, and the plague bacterium itself. Although PFB has been implied in plague literature for at least 50 years, we propose this mechanism, particularly with regard to flea responses, as central to epizootic plague rather than a phenomenon worthy of just peripheral mention. We also present new data on increases in flea:host ratios resulting from recreational shooting and poisoning as possible triggers for the transition from enzootic maintenance to PFB cycles and epizootic explosions. Although plague outbreaks have received much historic attention, PFB cycles that result in decimation of host populations lead to speculation that epizootic eruptions might not be part of the adaptive evolutionary strategy of Y. pestis but might instead be a tolerated intermittent cost of its modus operandi. We also speculate that there may be mammal communities where epizootics, as we define them, are rare or absent. Absence of plague epizootics might translate into reduced public health risk but does not necessarily equate to inconsequential ecologic impact.
26595463<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>From anxious youth to depressed adolescents: Prospective prediction of 2-year depression symptoms via attentional bias measures.<<>>Anxious youth are at heightened risk for subsequent development of depression; however, little is known regarding which anxious youth are at the highest prospective risk. Biased attentional patterns (e.g., vigilance and avoidance of negative cues) are implicated as key mechanisms in both anxiety and depression. Aberrant attentional patterns may disrupt opportunities to effectively engage with, and learn from, threatening aspects of the environment during development and/or treatment, compounding risk over time. Sixty-seven anxious youth (ages 9-14; 36 female) completed a dot-probe task to assess baseline attentional patterns provoked by fearful-neutral face pairs. The time course of attentional patterns both during and after threat was assessed via eye-tracking and pupilometry. Self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed 2 years after the conclusion of a larger psychotherapy treatment trial. Eye-tracking patterns indicating threat avoidance predicted greater 2-year depression scores, over and above baseline and posttreatment symptoms. Sustained, postthreat pupillary avoidance (reflecting preferential neural engagement with the neutral relative to the previously threatening location) predicted additional variance in depression scores, suggesting sustained avoidance in the wake of threat further exacerbated risk. Identical eye-tracking and pupil indices were not predictive of anxiety at 2 years. These biobehavioral markers imply that avoidant attentional processing in the context of anxiety may be a gateway to depression across a key maturational window. Excessive avoidance of threat could interfere with acquisition of adaptive emotion regulation skills during development, culminating in the broad behavioral deactivation that typifies depression. Prevention efforts explicitly targeting avoidant attentional patterns may be warranted.
30926310<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Second-generation aryl isonitrile compounds targeting multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.<<>>Antibiotic resistance remains a major global public health threat that requires sustained discovery of novel antibacterial agents with unexploited scaffolds. Structure-activity relationship of the first-generation aryl isonitrile compounds we synthesized led to an initial lead molecule that informed the synthesis of a second-generation of aryl isonitriles. From this new series of 20 compounds, three analogues inhibited growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (from 1 to 4microM) and were safe to human keratinocytes. Compound 19, with an additional isonitrile group exhibited improved activity against MRSA compared to the first-generation lead compound. This compound emerged as a candidate worthy of further investigation and further reinforced the importance of the isonitrile functionality in the compounds' anti-MRSA activity. In a murine skin wound model, 19 significantly reduced the burden of MRSA, similar to the antibiotic fusidic acid. In summary, 19 was identified as a new lead aryl isonitrile compound effective against MRSA.
16844143<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Neurologists and the threat of bioterrorism.<<>>Neurologists are most likely to become involved in primarily diagnosing those bioterrorist attacks utilising botulinum toxin. Oral ingestion, or possibly inhalation, are likely routes of delivery. The characteristic descending paralysis starts in the extraocular and bulbar muscles, with associated autonomic features. Repetitive nerve stimulation usually shows an incremental muscle response. Treatment is supportive. The differential diagnosis is from naturally occurring paralysing illnesses such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenic crisis or diphtheria, from paralysing seafood neurotoxins (tetrodotoxin, saxitoxin), snake envenomation, and from chemical warfare poisoning by organophosphates. Primary neurological infections are less feasible for use as bioweapons. There are theoretical possibilities of Venezuelan equine encephalitis transmission by inhalation and secondary zoonotic transmission cycles sustained by horses and mosquitoes. Severe haemorrhagic meningitis regularly occurs in anthrax, usually in the aftermath of severe systemic disease likely to have been transmitted by spore inhalation. Panic and psychologically determined 'me-too' symptomatology are likely to pose the biggest diagnostic and management burden on neurologists handling bioterrorist attack on an institution or a random civilian population. Indeed civilian panic and disablement of institutional operations are likely to be prominent intentions of any bioterrorist attack.
17081225<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Polyomavirus nephropathy in native kidneys and renal allografts: an update on an escalating threat.<<>>Polyomavirus nephropathy, also termed BK-virus nephropathy (BKN) after the main causative agent, the polyoma-BK-virus strain, is a significant complication after kidney transplantation. BKN is the most common viral infection that affects renal allografts with a prevalence of 1-9% on average 8-13 months post surgery. It can also occur sporadically in native kidneys. Viral nephropathy is caused by the (re)activation of latent BK viruses that enter into a replicative cycle under sustained and intensive immunosuppression. Pure productive kidney infections with JC- and SV-40 polyomaviruses are exceptionally rare. BKN is morphologically defined by the presence of intranuclear viral inclusion bodies in epithelial cells and tubular injury, which is the morphological correlate for renal dysfunction. Renal disease can progress through different histologic stages (from early BKN stage A to late fibrotic stage C) that carry prognostic significance; disease stages B and C often result in chronic kidney (allograft) dysfunction and end-stage renal disease. The clinical goal is to diagnose viral nephropathy in disease stage A and to limit chronic renal injury. Strategies to recognize, classify, and manage BKN are critically discussed including ancillary techniques for risk assessment and patient monitoring: (i) urine cytology and the search for so-called 'decoy cells'; (ii) PCR analyses for viral load measurements in the plasma and urine; and (iii) negative staining urine electron microscopy to identify viral particles.
28794976<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>General and emotion-specific alterations to cognitive control in women with a history of childhood abuse.<<>>BACKGROUND: Although limited, the literature suggests alterations in activation of cognitive control regions in adults and adolescents with a history of childhood abuse. The current study examined whether such alterations are increased in the face of emotionally-distracting as compared to emotionally neutral information, and whether such alterations occur in brain regions that exert cognitive control in a more top-down sustained manner or a more bottom-up transient manner. METHODS: Participants were young adult women (ages 23-30): one group with a history of childhood physical or sexual abuse (N = 15) and one with no trauma exposure (N = 17), as assessed through the Trauma History Questionnaire and a two-stage interview adapted from the National Crime Victims Survey. Participants underwent fMRI scanning while completing hybrid block/event-related versions of a classic color-word and an emotional Stroop paradigm (threat and positive words). This paradigm allowed us to examine both sustained (activation persisting across blocks) and transient (event-specific activation) aspects of cognitive control. RESULTS: Women with a history of childhood abuse demonstrated decreased recruitment of frontal-parietal regions involved in cognitive control and enhanced recruitment of a ventral attention surveillance network during blocks of both versions of the Stroop task. Additionally, they had less suppression of brain regions involved in self-referential processes for threat blocks, but greater suppression of these regions for positive blocks. Severity of avoidance symptoms was associated with sustained activation in lateral prefrontal regions, whereas hyperarousal/re-experiencing symptoms were associated with sustained activity in temporal regions. No differential effects were observed for transient control. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest exposure to childhood abuse is associated with blunted recruitment of brain regions supporting task-set maintenance but hypervigilance for task-irrelevant information, regardless of whether distractors are emotionally neutral or emotional. Exposure to childhood abuse is also associated with less suppression of default mode brain regions associated with self-referential processing in the face of irrelevant threat information, but heightened ability to suppress similar processing for irrelevant positive information.
18784466<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Microbial translocation is associated with sustained failure in CD4+ T-cell reconstitution in HIV-infected patients on long-term highly active antiretroviral therapy.<<>>Patients with inefficient CD4+ T-cell recovery on virogically suppressive highly active antiretroviral therapy constitute a major clinical hurdle given the threat of HIV/AIDS disease progression. We show heightened circulating lipopolysaccharide associated with plasma enterobacterial DNA and highly activated Ki67+CD4+CD8+ in 24 immunologic-nonresponders (CD4+ T-cell < or = 200; HIV-RNA < or = 50) compared with 11 full responders (CD4+ T-cell > or= 400; HIV-RNA < or = 50). These data provide novel insight into INRs pathogenesis, since they correlate augmented systemic translocation of microbial bioproducts with T-cell hyperactivation.
31063229<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>What Works? The Influence Of Changing Wastewater Treatment Type, Including Tertiary Granular Activated Charcoal On Downstream Macroinvertebrate Biodiversity Over Time.<<>>This study reviewed the impacts of wastewater on macroinvertebrates over four decades in a UK lowland river. This involved examining changes in chemicals, temperature, flow and macroinvertebrate diversity from the 1970s until 2017 for a wastewater-dominated river downstream of Swindon in the UK (population about 220,000). When the wastewater treatment process changed from trickling filter to activated sludge in 1991, biological oxygen demand was nearly halved (90%ile 8.1 to 4.6 mg/L), ammonia peaks dropped more than 7-fold (90%ile 3.9 to 0.53 mg/L) whilst dissolved oxygen climbed consistently above 60% saturation (10%ile went from 49% to 64%) at a sampling point 2 km downstream of the wastewater treatment plant. A sustained increase in the number of macroinvertebrate species was evident from that point. River flow did not change, temperature rose slightly, whilst the major metal concentrations declined steadily over most of the monitoring period. Neither the introduction of phosphate stripping in 1999, nor the use of tertiary granular activated charcoal from 2008 to 2014 had strong positive effects on subsequent macroinvertebrate diversity. That the diversity still had not reached the ideal status by 2016 may be related to the modest habitat quality, agricultural pesticides and the limited recolonization potential in the catchment. The results indicate that urban wastewaters, with their chemical pollutants, are today probably not the biggest threat to the macroinvertebrate diversity of multiple-stressed lowland rivers in the UK.

30571080<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Covalent Modifiers of Botulinum Neurotoxin Counteract Toxin Persistence.<<>>Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are the most potent toxins known to man and a significant threat as weapons of bioterrorism. BoNTs contain a metalloprotease domain that blocks neurotransmitter release in nerve terminals, resulting in a descending, flaccid paralysis with a 5-10% mortality rate. Existing treatment options cannot access or neutralize the toxin following its endocytosis, so there is a clear need to develop novel therapies. Numerous substrate-based and zinc-chelating small-molecule inhibitors have been reported; however, none have progressed to the clinic. This is likely due to the difficulty that reversible inhibitors have in achieving sustained inhibition of the toxin, which has a half-life of months in vivo. An alternative strategy for mitigating BoNT persistence is covalent, irreversible inhibition of toxin function. However, few examples of covalent BoNT inhibitors have been reported. Here, we describe a competition-based screen to identify covalent modifiers of the conserved active-site-adjacent cysteine C165 in the BoNT/A serotype. We found that compounds containing cysteine-reactive electrophiles designed to target cysteine proteases failed to bind C165 while selenide compounds were efficient covalent binders of this cysteine. Importantly, covalent modification at C165 resulted in sustained, irreversible inhibition of BoNT/A protease activity. Covalent selenide inhibitors were nontoxic and protective in a neuronal assay of intoxication, making them promising new scaffolds for the study of the BoNT/A toxin as well as for the design of novel therapy agents.
31078720<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Autonomic response in autism spectrum disorder: Relationship to social and cognitive functioning.<<>>Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may exhibit chronic autonomic nervous system (ANS) hyperarousal (e.g., lower respiratory sinus arrhythmia and higher heart rate) compared to their typically developing peers, reflecting a chronic biological threat response. The sustained nature of this cardiac threat suggests tonic nervous system perception of threat in safe contexts. Herein, the cardiac literature in adult and child populations with ASD is reviewed and placed within a continuum of functioning in order to inform the relationship between cardiac response and functioning in ASD. Findings from this review support the relationship between chronic autonomic hyperarousal and emotional and behavioral difficulties observed in individuals with ASD.
11147707<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Molt-related and size-dependent differences in the escape response and post-threat behavior of the American lobster, Homarus americanus.<<>>Videotaped recordings of adult lobsters of different molt stages were analyzed. The escape response of adults was compared with that of juveniles recorded in an earlier study. Juvenile lobsters always respond to a threat with escape behavior irrespective of their molt stage, but in adults the probability of eliciting a response was a function of molt stage: more hard-shelled (intermolt stage C) and (premolt stage D) animals tailflipped than did soft-shelled (postmolt stages A and B) animals. The number, frequency, and duration of tailflips, and the average distance swum by animals in each molt stage were measured for the entire escape response, for the initial power swim, and for the subsequent swims. These measurements were used to compute several parameters: velocity, acceleration, force, and work; average distance traveled in a tailflip for each kilogram of body weight (distance/kg/tailflip); and average distance traveled for each bodylength (distance/bodylength). Among adults, intermolt (stage C) lobsters traveled significantly farther and faster than postmolt animals (stages A and B). Among juveniles, late postmolt (stage B) animals traveled farther. Among adults, although the total number of tailflips and the duration of the response were not significantly different among molt stages, the number of tailflips/second (frequency) and distance traveled/kg/tailflip were greater for intermolt animals. In juvenile intermolts, however, frequency and distance/kg/tailflip were markedly lower than in the premolt stages. Although values were lower than intermolts and premolts, postmolt adults sustained their swimming frequency, distance/kg/tailflip, and distance/bodylength for the entire escape distance (as did postmolt juveniles). These parameters then dropped off sharply for both adult and juvenile intermolt and premolt animals in the second half of the escape distance. Post-threat behaviors reveal that stage D animals have the highest aggression index and often attack the presented stimulus, whereas stage A animals are the least likely to approach the stimulus and typically back away in a non-aggressive posture. Thus, although effects of the molt cycle on adult and juvenile escape behavior are similar in some ways, other physical characteristics of adults, such as weight, allometry, and physiology, seem to become important in determining the likelihood of escape behavior and the characteristics of the escape swim in each molt stage.
29604307<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Laughter as a social rejection cue: Influence of prior explicit experience of social rejection on cardiac signs of "freezing".<<>>The study aimed at investigating the immediate cardiac effect of the sudden perception of other people's laughter after experimentally manipulating healthy participants' proneness to experience laughter as a cue of social threat. We expected that participants would show cardiac signs of freezing (i.e., sustained heart rate deceleration immediately after perception of the laughter) after prior social rejection but not or less so after prior acceptance, due to an increased bias to perceive the ambiguous social signal as a cue of social threat and rejection after rejection had been primed. Contrary to expectations, the perception of other people's laughter elicited a decelerative (freezing) response regardless of whether it was preceded by the experience of social rejection or acceptance. The response was prolonged in participants who had been accepted beforehand compared to those who had been rejected. The findings indicate that, given a relevant social context, other people's laughter can be a powerful cue of social threat and rejection also in healthy individuals. Prolonged heart rate deceleration after an ambiguous social signal may facilitate the processing of significant social information in the socially threatening situation. The study adds to the literature rendering the course of the immediate transient heart rate response a useful tool in social rejection research. Additionally, the findings suggested that in some cases the further progress of transient heart rate changes in more extended time-windows (about 30s) may provide additional relevant information about the processing of social cues.
17658909<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Sustained-release ophthalmic drug delivery systems for treatment of macular disorders: present and future applications.<<>>Macular disease currently poses the greatest threat to vision in aging populations. Historically, most of this pathology could only be dealt with surgically, and then only after much damage to the macula had already occurred. Current pathophysiological insights into macular diseases have allowed the development of effective new pharmacotherapies. The field of drug delivery systems has advanced over the last several years with emphasis placed on controlled release of drug to specific areas of the eye. Its unique location and tendency toward chronic disease make the macula an important and attractive target for drug delivery systems, especially sustained-release systems. This review evaluates the current literature on the research and development of sustained-release posterior segment drug delivery systems that are primarily intended for macular disease with an emphasis on age-related macular degeneration.Current effective therapies include corticosteroids and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor compounds. Recent successes have been reported using anti-angiogenic drugs for therapy of age-related macular degeneration. This review also includes information on implantable devices (biodegradable and non-biodegradable), the use of injected particles (microspheres and liposomes) and future enhanced drug delivery systems, such as ultrasound drug delivery. The devices reviewed show significant drug release over a period of days or weeks. However, macular disorders are chronic diseases requiring years of treatment. Currently, there is no 'gold standard' for therapy and/or drug delivery. Future studies will focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of drug delivery to the posterior chamber. If successful, therapeutic modalities will significantly delay loss of vision and improve the quality of life for patients with chronic macular disorders.
31029255<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>A User-Centered design and usability testing of a web-based medication reconciliation application integrated in an eHealth network.<<>>BACKGROUND: Medication discrepancies, which are a threat to patient safety, can be reduced by medication reconciliation (MedRec). MedRec is a complex process that can be supported by the use of information technology and patient engagement. Therefore, the SEAMPAT project aims to develop a MedRec IT platform based on two applications. The application for the professionals is called: the "MedRec app". OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we aimed to describe the development and usability testing of the MedRec app, reporting results of a three iterations user-centered usability evaluation. METHODS: We used a three phase iterative user-centered study spread over 16 months. At each phase, the usability evaluation included several methods (observations, questionnaires, and follow-up discussions with participants) to collect quantitative and qualitative data in order to improve the current prototype and evolve to the next prototype. RESULTS: In total, 48 healthcare professionals (25 general practitioners and 23 hospital clinicians) participated to the MedRec app evaluation. There were 14, 32 and 5 participants for phases 1, 2 and 3 respectively. At each phase, many design modifications were done to strengthen usability. Concerning usability, participants considered the prototypes as an acceptable interface with a median System Usability Score of 73 at phase 2 and 75 at phase 3. Participants emphasized the need for improvements concerning workflow integration, usefulness and interoperability. CONCLUSION: The MedRec app was perceived as being useful, usable and satisfying. However, further improvements are required in several usability aspects. Our study demonstrates the importance of conducting usability assessments before investing time and resources in a large study evaluating the effect of an eMedRec approach on clinical outcomes. Our findings may also increase the chances of acceptability and sustained use over time by clinicians.
27870942<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Altered time course of amygdala activation during speech anticipation in social anxiety disorder.<<>>BACKGROUND: Exaggerated anticipatory anxiety is common in social anxiety disorder (SAD). Neuroimaging studies have revealed altered neural activity in response to social stimuli in SAD, but fewer studies have examined neural activity during anticipation of feared social stimuli in SAD. The current study examined the time course and magnitude of activity in threat processing brain regions during speech anticipation in socially anxious individuals and healthy controls (HC). METHOD: Participants (SAD n=58; HC n=16) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during which they completed a 90s control anticipation task and 90s speech anticipation task. Repeated measures multi-level modeling analyses were used to examine group differences in time course activity during speech vs. control anticipation for regions of interest, including bilateral amygdala, insula, ventral striatum, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. RESULTS: The time course of amygdala activity was more prolonged and less variable throughout speech anticipation in SAD participants compared to HCs, whereas the overall magnitude of amygdala response did not differ between groups. Magnitude and time course of activity was largely similar between groups across other regions of interest. LIMITATIONS: Analyses were restricted to regions of interest and task order was the same across participants due to the nature of deception instructions. CONCLUSIONS: Sustained amygdala time course during anticipation may uniquely reflect heightened detection of threat or deficits in emotion regulation in socially anxious individuals. Findings highlight the importance of examining temporal dynamics of amygdala responding.
26877130<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>The NIMH Research Domain Criteria initiative and error-related brain activity.<<>>Research on the neural response to errors has an important role in the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project, since it is likely to link psychopathology to the dysfunction of neural systems underlying basic behavioral functions, with the error-related negativity (ERN) appearing as a unit of measurement in three RDoC domains. A recent report builds on previous research by examining the ERN as a measure of the sustained threat construct and providing evidence that the ERN may reflect sensitivity more specifically to endogenous threat. Data from 515 adolescent females indicate that the ERN was enlarged primarily in older adolescents with self-reported checking behaviors, although it was blunted in adolescents with depressive symptoms regardless of age. Potential future studies for replicating and extending the research on the ERN and obsessive-compulsive (OC) behaviors are discussed, including studies that more fully characterize OC symptom dimensions, studies that integrate other measures of error-related brain activity and use computational modeling, studies that combine longitudinal, family, and molecular genetic measures, and interventional studies that specifically modulate error-related brain activity in individuals with OC behaviors.
23495461<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Risk and protective factors associated with symptoms of post-traumatic stress, depression, and alcohol misuse in OEF/OIF veterans.<<>>Military personnel returning from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan commonly experience mental health problems and efforts are underway to determine risk and protective factors associated with postdeployment mental health concerns. This study examined the contribution of trait neuroticism, predeployment life events, combat experience, perceptions of threat, and postdeployment social support on mental health symptoms at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months postdeployment. Two hundred seventy-one veterans completed self-report measures. Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that neuroticism predicted post-traumatic stress and depressive symptoms at all 3 time points; perceived threat predicted post-traumatic stress symptoms at time 1 and time 2 and depressive symptoms at time 2. Social support was a strong negative predictor of post-traumatic stress and depressive symptoms. Alcohol misuse was not significantly predicted by any of the variables. The present study highlights the role of perceived threat and trait neuroticism on postdeployment mental health symptoms and indicates social support is a robust protective factor. Efforts aimed at increasing sustained postdeployment social support may help defend against significant mental health problems among veterans.
30964612<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Resting-state connectivity of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the central nucleus of the amygdala in clinical anxiety<<>>Background: The central nucleus of the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis are involved primarily in phasic and sustained aversive states. Although both structures have been implicated in pathological anxiety, few studies with a clinical population have specifically focused on them, partly because of their small size. Previous work in our group used high-resolution imaging to map the restingstate functional connectivity of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the central nucleus of the amygdala in healthy subjects at 7 T, confirming and extending structural findings in humans and animals, while providing additional insight into cortical connectivity that is potentially unique to humans. Methods: In the current follow-up study, we contrasted resting-state functional connectivity in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and central nucleus of the amygdala at 7 T between healthy volunteers (n = 30) and patients with generalized and/or social anxiety disorder (n = 30). Results: Results revealed significant voxel-level group differences. Compared with healthy volunteers, patients showed stronger resting-state functional connectivity between the central nucleus of the amygdala and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and superior temporal sulcus. They also showed weaker resting-state functional connectivity between the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and occipital cortex. Limitations: These findings depart from a previous report of resting-state functional connectivity in the central nucleus of the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis under sustained threat of shock in healthy volunteers. Conclusion: This study provides functional MRI proxies of the functional dissociation of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and central nucleus of the amygdala, and suggests that resting-state functional connectivity of key structures in the processing of defensive responses do not recapitulate changes related to induced state anxiety. Future work needs to replicate and further probe the clinical significance of these findings.
29744449<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>DOX/IL-2/IFN-gamma co-loaded thermo-sensitive polypeptide hydrogel for efficient melanoma treatment.<<>>Melanoma has been a serious threat to the human health; however, effective therapeutic methods of this cancer are still limited. Combined local therapy is a crucial approach for achieving a superior anti-tumor efficacy. In this paper, a chemo-immunotherapy system of DOX, IL-2 and IFN-gamma based on poly(gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate) (PELG-PEG-PELG) hydrogel was developed for local treatment of melanoma xenograft. The drug release process of this system exhibited a short term of burst release (the first 3 days), followed by a long-term sustained release (the following 26 days). The hydrogel degraded completely within 3 weeks without obvious inflammatory responses in the subcutaneous layer of rats, showing a good biodegradability and biocompatibility. The DOX/IL-2/IFN-gamma co-loaded hydrogel also showed enhanced anti-tumor effect against B16F10 cells in vitro, through increasing the ratio of cell apoptosis and G2/S phage cycle arrest. Moreover, the combined strategy presented improved therapy efficacy against B16F10 melanoma xenograft without obvious systemic side effects in a nude mice model, which was likely related to both the enhanced tumor cell apoptosis and the increased proliferation of the CD3(+)/CD4(+) T-lymphocytes and CD3(+)/CD8(+) T-lymphocytes. Overall, the strategy of localized co-delivery of DOX/IL-2/IFN-gamma using the polypeptide hydrogel provided a promising approach for efficient melanoma therapy.
30054732<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Oxytocin facilitates adaptive fear and attenuates anxiety responses in animal models and human studies-potential interaction with the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST).<<>>Despite its relatively well-understood role as a reproductive and pro-social peptide, oxytocin (OT) tells a more convoluted story in terms of its modulation of fear and anxiety. This nuanced story has been obscured by a great deal of research into the therapeutic applications of exogenous OT, driving more than 400 ongoing clinical trials. Drawing from animal models and human studies, we review the complex evidence concerning OT's role in fear learning and anxiety, clarifying the existing confusion about modulation of fear versus anxiety. We discuss animal models and human studies demonstrating the prevailing role of OT in strengthening fear memory to a discrete signal or cue, which allows accurate and rapid threat detection that facilitates survival. We also review ostensibly contrasting behavioral studies that nonetheless provide compelling evidence of OT attenuating sustained contextual fear and anxiety-like behavior, arguing that these OT effects on the modulation of fear vs. anxiety are not mutually exclusive. To disambiguate how endogenous OT modulates fear and anxiety, an understudied area compared to exogenous OT, we survey behavioral studies utilizing OT receptor (OTR) antagonists. Based on emerging evidence about the role of OTR in rat dorsolateral bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) and elsewhere, we postulate that OT plays a critical role in facilitating accurate discrimination between stimuli representing threat and safety. Supported by human studies, we demonstrate that OT uniquely facilitates adaptive fear but reduces maladaptive anxiety. Last, we explore the limited literature on endogenous OT and its interaction with corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) with a special emphasis on the dorsolateral BNST, which may hold the key to the neurobiology of phasic fear and sustained anxiety.
19012228<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>[Thermal trauma sustained during epileptic seizures--analysis of 33 cases].<<>>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Burn injuries are a serious threat to individuals with altered consciousness during epilepsy. The objective of this study detailing 33 individuals who sustained scalds or burn injuries during an epileptic seizure, was to clarify typical injury mechanisms, extent, therapy and sequelae of these injuries and thus identify potential preventive measures to protect this special population from thermal trauma. RESULTS: Overall, 16 women and 17 men with a mean age of 39.6 (range: 21 - 76) years were included in this retrospective review. The burned body area averaged 16 % (maximum: 51 %), 30 of the 33 patients (91 %) required burn wound excision and skin grafting. The mean ABSI score was 5.5 (range: 3 to 11) points. Thermal trauma mostly occurred as hot water scalds (n = 19) during showering or bathing in a tub (n = 15), followed by falls during cooking or into open fire. None of our patients was informed about the risk of experiencing severe thermal injuries during epileptic seizures. The length of intensive care averaged 33 days (maximum: 79 days), all patients survived. The estimated treatment costs were at least 50,000 Euros per patient. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, epileptic seizures can cause severe and deep thermal trauma. Our data shows that most of these injuries happen at home and may be easily prevented by simple safety devices, such as water thermo-regulators or the avoidance of high-risk situations, it seems advisable to inform patients with epilepsy and their families and care-givers of this specific danger.
30965153<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>States simply do not care: The failure of international securitisation of drug control in Afghanistan.<<>>The link between the world drug problem and securitisation has been predominantly established to argue that an existential threat discourse reinforces the international prohibitionist regime and makes it harder for alternative policy models to arise. This analysis is problematic for three main reasons. Firstly, it overestimates the current strength of the international drug control regime as a normative and regulatory system that prescribes state behaviour. Secondly, the current international regime does not inhibit policy reforms. While the international treaty system proves resistant to change, it is at the national and local levels where new drug policies arise. Moreover, these are generally not the draconian or emergency measures that successful securitisation would predict. Thirdly, the analysis so far misinterprets criminalisation or militarisation as evidence of securitisation. As the case of Afghanistan shows, securitisation attempts, such as those linking the Taliban and the illicit opium economy, may have reinforced the militarisation of drug control in Afghanistan, but did not elevate the illicit drug economy as an external threat or a top priority. While there have been short-lived spikes of attention and provincial level campaigns to eradicate poppy cultivation, these have never translated into a sustained structural effort to combat illicit drugs in Afghanistan. Even the latest push for militarisation, the US-led campaign of airstrikes on drug processing laboratories since November 2017, represents more a shift in counter-insurgency strategy than successful securitisation. While Afghanistan's illicit drug economy has been politicised for several reasons, states are not convinced that this economy somehow represents an existential threat to their survival.
29888446<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Caste ratio adjustments in response to perceived and realised competition in parasites with division of labour.<<>>Colonial organisms with division of labour are assumed to achieve increased colony-level efficiency in task performance through functional specialisation of individuals into distinct castes. In social insects, ratios of individuals in different castes can adjust adaptively in response to external threats. However, whether flexibility in caste ratio also occurs in other social organisms with division of labour remains unclear. Some parasitic trematodes, in which clonal colonies within the snail intermediate host comprise a reproductive caste and a soldier caste, offer good systems to test the general nature of adaptive caste ratio adjustments. Using the trematode Philophthalmus sp. as model, we test whether trematode colonies shift their composition towards more soldiers when exposed to a sustained risk of invasion by a competitor parasite species, and/or when experiencing sustained, active competition. We also quantify the colony-level fitness impact of caste ratio adjustments, measured as the colony's output of larval infective stages. We conducted two long-term laboratory experiments on within-snail trematode colonies. First, snails harbouring Philophthalmus colonies were exposed to different levels of invasion risk by another trematode species, Maritrema novaezealandense. Second, the structure of Philophthalmus colonies was quantified after a year-long period of within-snail competition with the other trematode species. When facing the risk of invasion by a competitor, independently of the level of risk, Philophthalmus colonies showed a significant shift towards producing more soldiers, resulting in altered caste ratio. Similarly, when experiencing actual competition by another trematode established in the same snail, Philophthalmus colonies also adjusted by producing significantly more soldiers. Greater investments in defense via more soldiers had negative impacts on the establishment and size of the competitor's colonies. Nevertheless, the presence of the competitor reduced the fitness (output of infective stages) of Philophthalmus colonies, although the production of more soldiers mitigated that effect. Our findings demonstrate that trematode colonies with division of labour are capable of adaptive caste ratio adjustments in response to both the perceived threat of competition and actual competition, with trade-offs against reproductive success only apparent when soldier numbers are very high. Combined with results on social insects, our study suggests parallel adaptations of colonial organisms in phylogenetically disparate organisms.
16631127<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>The benzodiazepine alprazolam dissociates contextual fear from cued fear in humans as assessed by fear-potentiated startle.<<>>BACKGROUND: The startle reflex is potentiated by aversive states. It has been proposed that phasic startle potentiation to a threat cue and sustained startle potentiation to contextual stimuli reflect distinct processes mediated by different brain structures. The present study tested the hypothesis that alprazolam would reduce the sustained startle potentiation to contextual threats but not the startle potentiation to a threat cue. METHODS: Sixteen healthy subjects received each of four treatments: placebo, .5 mg of alprazolam, 1 mg of alprazolam, and 50 mg of diphenhydramine (Benadryl) in a crossover design. Participants were exposed to three conditions, including one in which predictable aversive shocks were signaled by a cue, a second in which shocks were administered unpredictably, and a third condition in which no shocks were anticipated. Acoustic startle were delivered regularly across conditions. RESULTS: Phasic startle potentiation to the threat cue in the predictable condition was not affected by alprazolam. In contrast, the sustained increase in startle in the predictable and unpredictable conditions was reduced significantly by the high dose of alprazolam. CONCLUSIONS: Startle responses to an explicit threat cue and to an aversive context are psychopharmacologically distinct, suggesting that they may represent functionally dissociable aversive states.
25972166<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Neural mechanisms of placebo anxiolysis.<<>>The beneficial effects of placebo treatments on fear and anxiety (placebo anxiolysis) are well known from clinical practice, and there is strong evidence indicating a contribution of treatment expectations to the efficacy of anxiolytic drugs. Although clinically highly relevant, the neural mechanisms underlying placebo anxiolysis are poorly understood. In two studies in humans, we tested whether the administration of an inactive treatment along with verbal suggestions of anxiolysis can attenuate experimentally induced states of phasic fear and/or sustained anxiety. Phasic fear is the response to a well defined threat and includes attentional focusing on the source of threat and concomitant phasic increases of autonomic arousal, whereas in sustained states of anxiety potential and unclear danger requires vigilant scanning of the environment and elevated tonic arousal levels. Our placebo manipulation consistently reduced vigilance measured in terms of undifferentiated reactivity to salient cues (indexed by subjective ratings, skin conductance responses and EEG event-related potentials) and tonic arousal [indexed by cue-unrelated skin conductance levels and enhanced EEG alpha (8-12 Hz) activity], indicating a downregulation of sustained anxiety rather than phasic fear. We also observed a placebo-dependent sustained increase of frontal midline EEG theta (4-7 Hz) power and frontoposterior theta coupling, suggesting the recruitment of frontally based cognitive control functions. Our results thus support the crucial role of treatment expectations in placebo anxiolysis and provide insight into the underlying neural mechanisms.
27296662<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>An Initial Evaluation of a Comprehensive Continuing Care Intervention for Clients with Substance Use Disorders: My First Year of Recovery (MyFYR).<<>>INTRODUCTION: Physician health programs (PHPs) generate high rates of sustained abstinence in addicted physicians, through a combination of formal treatment, self-help involvement, regular monitoring via random urine toxicology tests, and powerful incentives generated by the threat of losing one's medical license. Recently, Caron Treatment Centers developed a new continuing care intervention, "My First Year of Recovery" (MyFYR), which is modeled after PHPs but provides extended recovery support to a broader segment of those with substance use disorders. This paper presents initial outcome data from MyFYR. METHODS: MyFYR features frequent outcomes monitoring via urine toxicology tests, and also includes a web-based social platform to coordinate efforts of recovery coaches, family members, and others (e.g., employers, probation officers). Participants were the first 198 clients who enrolled in MyFYR after participating in residential treatment at Caron. Substance use outcomes were determined by a combination of urine toxicology tests, client self-report, and information from family members obtained during a 12-month period following entry into MyFYR. RESULTS: Clients in MyFYR provided 70% of scheduled urine samples, for an average of 16.4 urine samples per client. Only 4.1% of the samples tested positive for alcohol or any drug. As determined by urine toxicology and client and family reports, 54% of the participants had some use of alcohol or drugs during the follow-up. Of these relapsed clients, 70.1% were retained or re-engaged in MyFYR, and of these, half were able to re-establish abstinence of two months duration or more, as documented by urine toxicology. DISCUSSION: These initial results are extremely promising, as they document high rates of sustained participation in urine drug test monitoring and positive outcome in clients not under the threat of losing a professional license or incarceration.
26925833<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Circulating angiogenic cell function is inhibited by cortisol in vitro and associated with psychological stress and cortisol in vivo.<<>>Psychological stress and glucocorticoids are associated with heightened cardiovascular disease risk. We investigated whether stress or cortisol would be associated with reduced circulating angiogenic cell (CAC) function, an index of impaired vascular repair. We hypothesized that minority-race individuals who experience threat in interracial interactions would exhibit reduced CAC function, and that this link might be explained by cortisol. To test this experimentally, we recruited 106 African American participants for a laboratory interracial interaction task, in which they received socially evaluative feedback from Caucasian confederates. On a separate day, a subset of 32 participants (mean age=26years, 47% female) enrolled in a separate biological substudy and provided blood samples for CAC isolation and salivary samples to quantify the morning peak in cortisol (the cortisol awakening response, CAR). CAC function was quantified using cell culture assays of migration to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and secretion of VEGF into the culture medium. Heightened threat in response to an interracial interaction and trait anxiety in vivo were both associated with poorer CAC migratory function in vitro. Further, threat and poorer sustained attention during the interracial interaction were associated with a higher CAR, which in turn, was related to lower CAC sensitivity to glucocorticoids. In vitro, higher doses of cortisol impaired CAC migratory function and VEGF protein secretion. The glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 reversed this functional impairment. These data identify a novel, neuroendocrine pathway by which psychological stress may reduce CAC function, with potential implications for cardiovascular health.
29313252<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Childhood maltreatment is associated with increased neural response to ambiguous threatening facial expressions in adulthood: Evidence from the late positive potential.<<>>Childhood maltreatment increases lifetime vulnerability for psychopathology. One proposed mechanism for this association is that early maltreatment increases vigilance for and attention to subtle threat cues, persisting outside of the environment in which maltreatment occurs. To test this possibility, the present study examined neural responses to ambiguous and nonambiguous threatening facial expressions in a sample of 25 adults reporting a history of low-to-moderate levels of abuse in childhood and 46 reporting no or low levels of childhood maltreatment. The measure of neural response used was the late positive potential (LPP), a neural marker of sustained attention to motivationally salient information that is sensitive to subtle variation in emotional content. Participants passively viewed angry-neutral and fearful-neutral face blends and rated emotional intensity for each face. In the maltreated group, as fearful faces increased in emotional intensity, the LPP similarly increased, suggesting increased sensitivity to subtle variation in threatening content. Moreover, the LPP at each level of emotional intensity was not related to current symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, contrary to our hypotheses, adults with a history of abuse did not rate angry or fearful faces as more threatening, nor did they exhibit a larger LPP to angry faces, compared to controls. These findings suggest that childhood maltreatment may be associated with increased sensitivity to ambiguous threatening information in adulthood.
28082881<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Association between Attention and Heart Rate Fluctuations in Pathological Worriers.<<>>Recent data suggests that several psychopathological conditions are associated with alterations in the variability of behavioral and physiological responses. Pathological worry, defined as the cognitive representation of a potential threat, has been associated with reduced variability of heart beat oscillations (i.e., decreased heart rate variability; HRV) and lapses of attention indexed by reaction times (RTs). Clinical populations with attention deficit show RTs oscillation around 0.05 and 0.01 Hz when performing a sustained attention task. We tested the hypothesis that people who are prone to worry do it in a predictable oscillating pattern revealed through recurrent lapses in attention and concomitant oscillating HRV. Sixty healthy young adults (50% women) were recruited: 30 exceeded the clinical cut-off on the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ; High-Worry, HW); the remaining 30 constituted the Low-Worry (LW) group. After a diagnostic assessment, participants performed two 15-min sustained attention tasks, interspersed by a standardized worry-induction procedure. RTs, HRV and moods were assessed. The analyses of the frequency spectrum showed that the HW group presents a significant higher and constant peak of RTs oscillation around 0.01 Hz (period 100 s) after the induction of worry, in comparison with their baseline and with the LW group that was not responsive to the induction procedure. Physiologically, the induction significantly reduced high-frequency HRV and such reduction was associated with levels of self-reported worry. Results are coherent with the oscillatory nature of the default mode network (DMN) and further confirm an association between cognitive rigidity and autonomic nervous system inflexibility.
30875250<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Task Engagement and the Vigilance Decrement Revisited: Expanding Upon the Work of Joel S. Warm Using a Semantic Vigilance Paradigm.<<>>OBJECTIVE: The goal of the present study is twofold: (1) demonstrate the importance of measuring and understanding the relationship between task engagement and vigilance performance, and (2) celebrate the work of Joel S. Warm and expand upon his previous research in two semantic vigilance paradigms. BACKGROUND: The importance of measuring task engagement in cognitive and sensory vigilance tasks has been well documented. But to date, our understanding of the effects of task engagement on semantic vigilance performance is limited. METHOD: Seventy-three participants completed either a standard semantic vigilance task or a lure semantic vigilance task. Participants also completed subjective measures of workload and stress. RESULTS: The results indicated that changes in task engagement are associated with correct detection performance. Changes in task engagement may be related to individual differences in the distress associated with performing semantic vigilance tasks. CONCLUSION: In line with the work of Warm and his colleagues (Dember, Warm, Bowers, & Lanzetta, 1984), participants who reported increased task engagement after the vigil outperformed their peers who noted decreased task engagement upon conclusion of the task. Participants reporting increases in engagement with the semantic vigilance tasks also reported significantly greater distress pretask, but not posttask. Instead, increases in postvigil distress were driven by the task to which participants were assigned, not task engagement. APPLICATION: The present study has several implications for applied settings that involve long duration semantic processing or semantic target identification. Such real-world tasks include aviation, cyber threat detection and analysis, driving, and reading.
29269331<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>A bio-based pro-antimicrobial polymer network via degradable acetal linkages.<<>>The synthesis of a fully degradable, bio-based, sustained release, pro-antimicrobial polymer network comprised of degradable acetals (PANDA) is reported. The active antimicrobial agent - p-anisaldehyde (pA) (an extract from star anise) - was converted into a UV curable acetal containing pro-antimicrobial monomer and subsequently photopolymerized into a homogenous thiol-ene network. Under neutral to acidic conditions (pH<8), the PANDAs undergo surface erosion and exhibit sustained release of pA over 38days. The release of pA from PANDAs was shown to be effective against both bacterial and fungal pathogens. From a combination of confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, we observed that the released pA disrupts the cell membrane. Additionally, we demonstrated that PANDAs have minimal cytotoxicity towards both epithelial cells and macrophages. Although a model platform, these results point to promising pathways for the design of fully degradable sustained-release antimicrobial systems with potential applications in agriculture, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, household/personal care, and food industries. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: With the increasing number of patients prescribed immunosuppressants coupled with the rise in antibiotic resistance - life-threatening microbial infections are a looming global threat. With limited success within the antibiotic pipeline, nature-based essential oils (EOs) are being investigated for their multimodal effectiveness against microbes. Despite the promising potential of EOs, difficulties in their encapsulation, limited water solubility, and high volatility limit their use. Various studies have shown that covalent attachment of these EO derivatives to polymers can mitigate these limitations. The current study presents the synthesis of a fully-degradable, sustained release, cytocompatible, pro-antimicrobial acetal network derived from p-anisaldehyde. This polymer network design provides a pathway toward application-specific EO releasing materials with quantitative encapsulation efficiencies, sustained release, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity.
28292588<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Endoscopy after esophagectomy: Safety demonstrated in a porcine model.<<>>BACKGROUND: Endoscopy is useful in assessing conduit ischemia and anastomotic leaks after esophagectomy but poses a theoretical threat of anastomotic disruption. We used a porcine model to evaluate the safety of endoscopy after esophagectomy. METHODS: We performed esophagectomies in 10 live pigs and performed endoscopy with progressive air insufflation and continuous intraluminal pressure monitoring. We stopped insufflation when the intraluminal pressure reached a plateau. We assessed the integrity of the conduit and anastomosis via endoscopy. We also performed pulse oximetry of the stomach and Doppler velocimetry of the right gastroepiploic artery on 5 live pigs to study the effects of endoscopic gastric insufflation. RESULTS: With gentle air insufflation, there was no measurable increase in intraluminal pressure, disruption of the conduit or anastomosis, or significant gastric distension. With progressive insufflation, the intraluminal pressure reached a plateau at a maximum of 8.7 +/- 2.1 cm H2O (95% confidence interval, 7.2-10.2). At this plateau, air leaked retrograde via the mouth, which prevented further gastric distension. There were no significant changes in oxyhemoglobin saturation along various regions in the stomach even with maximal insufflation sustained for 10 minutes. There was a momentary reduction in gastroepiploic flow from 12.0 +/- 1.0 [95% confidence interval, 10.8-13.2] mL/min/100 g to 9.6 +/- 1.5 [95% confidence interval, 7.8-11.4] mL/min/100 g immediately after maximal insufflation, but flow recovered to 11 +/- 1.3 [9.6, 12.8] mL/min/100 g after 10 minutes of sustained insufflation. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopy after esophagectomy with gentle or maximal air insufflation results in safe endoluminal pressures and minimal disturbance of blood flow and oxygenation.
29054817<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Attend or defend? Sex differences in behavioral, autonomic, and respiratory response patterns to emotion-eliciting films.<<>>Sex differences in emotional reactivity have been studied primarily for negative but less so for positive stimuli; likewise, sex differences in the psychophysiological response-patterning during such stimuli are poorly understood. Thus, the present study examined sex differences in response to negative/positive and high/low arousing films (classified as threat-, loss-, achievement-, and recreation-related, vs. neutral films), while measuring 18 muscular, autonomic, and respiratory parameters. Sex differences emerged for all films, but were most prominent for threat-related films: Despite equivalent valence and arousal ratings, women displayed more facial-muscular and respiratory responding than men and pronounced sympathetic activation (preejection period, other cardiovascular and electrodermal measures), while men showed coactivated sympathetic/parasympathetic responding (including increased respiratory sinus arrhythmia). This indicates a prototypical threat-related defense response in women, while men showed a pattern of sustained orienting, which can be understood as a shift toward less threat proximity in the defense cascade model. Clinical implications are discussed within a socio-evolutionary framework.
26047059<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>A randomized controlled trial of attention modification for social anxiety disorder.<<>>Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) models implicate social threat cue vigilance (i.e., attentional biases) in symptom development and maintenance. A modified dot-probe protocol has been shown to reduce SAD symptoms, in some but not all studies, presumably by modifying an attentional bias. The current randomized controlled trial was designed to replicate and extend such research. Participants included treatment-seeking adults (n = 108; 58% women) who met diagnostic criteria for SAD. Participants were randomly assigned to a standard (i.e., control) or modified (i.e., active) dot-probe protocol condition and to participate in-lab or at home. The protocol involved twice-weekly 15-min sessions, for 4 weeks, with questionnaires completed at baseline, post-treatment, 4-month follow-up, and 8-month follow-up. Symptom reports were assessed with repeated measures mixed hierarchical modeling. There was a main effect of time from baseline to post-treatment wherein social anxiety symptoms declined significantly (p < .05) but depression and trait anxiety did not (p > .05). There were no significant interactions based on condition or participation location (ps > .05). Reductions were maintained at 8-month follow-up. Symptom reductions were not correlated with threat biases as indexed by the dot-probe task. The modified and standard protocol both produced significant sustained symptom reductions, whether administered in-lab or at home. There were no robust differences based on protocol type. As such, the mechanisms for benefits associated with modified dot-probe protocols warrant additional research.
30647010<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Accelerating the elimination of viral hepatitis: a Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology Commission.<<>>Viral hepatitis is a major public health threat and a leading cause of death worldwide. Annual mortality from viral hepatitis is similar to that of other major infectious diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis. Highly effective prevention measures and treatments have made the global elimination of viral hepatitis a realistic goal, endorsed by all WHO member states. Ambitious targets call for a global reduction in hepatitis-related mortality of 65% and a 90% reduction in new infections by 2030. This Commission draws together a wide range of expertise to appraise the current global situation and to identify priorities globally, regionally, and nationally needed to accelerate progress. We identify 20 heavily burdened countries that account for over 75% of the global burden of viral hepatitis. Key recommendations include a greater focus on national progress towards elimination with support given, if necessary, through innovative financing measures to ensure elimination programmes are fully funded by 2020. In addition to further measures to improve access to vaccination and treatment, greater attention needs to be paid to access to affordable, high-quality diagnostics if testing is to reach the levels needed to achieve elimination goals. Simplified, decentralised models of care removing requirements for specialised prescribing will be required to reach those in need, together with sustained efforts to tackle stigma and discrimination. We identify key examples of the progress that has already been made in many countries throughout the world, demonstrating that sustained and coordinated efforts can be successful in achieving the WHO elimination goals.
23547713<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Anterior cingulate cortex and insula response during indirect and direct processing of emotional faces in generalized social anxiety disorder.<<>>BACKGROUND: Generalized social anxiety disorder (gSAD) is associated with a heightened neural sensitivity to signals that convey threat, as evidenced by exaggerated amygdala and/or insula activation when processing face stimuli that express negative emotions. Less clear in the brain pathophysiology of gSAD are cortical top down control mechanisms that moderate reactivity in these subcortical emotion processing regions. This study evaluated amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity in gSAD with a novel "Emotional Faces Shifting Attention Task" (EFSAT), an adaptation of perceptual assessment tasks well-known to elicit amygdala response. In healthy volunteers, the task has been shown to engage the amygdala when attention is directed to emotional faces and the ACC when attention is directed to shapes, away from emotional faces. METHODS: During functional MRI, 29 participants with gSAD and 27 healthy controls viewed images comprising a trio of faces (angry, fear, or happy) alongside a trio of geometric shapes (circles, rectangles, or triangles) within the same field of view. Participants were instructed to match faces or match shapes, effectively directing attention towards or away from emotional information, respectively. RESULTS: Participants with gSAD exhibited greater insula, but not amygdala, activation compared to controls when attending to emotional faces. In contrast, when attention was directed away from faces, controls exhibited ACC recruitment, which was not evident in gSAD. Across participants, greater ACC activation was associated with less insula activation. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence that individuals with gSAD exhibited exaggerated insula reactivity when attending to emotional faces in EFSAT is consistent with other studies suggesting that the neural basis of gSAD may involve insula hyper-reactivity. Furthermore, greater ACC response in controls than gSAD when sustained goal-directed attention is required to shift attention away from social signals, together with a negative relationship between ACC and bilateral insula activity, indicate the ACC may have served a regulatory role when the focus of attention was directed to shapes amidst emotional faces.
29664710<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Analysis of Host and Viral-Related Factors Associated to Direct Acting Antiviral Response in Hepatitis C Virus Patients.<<>>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) signifies an important health issue as it is a globally prevalent pathogen and poses a great threat to human health. Direct antiviral therapy became a landmark in treatment against chronic HCV infection as they have proven to increase sustained virological response (SVR) rate, provide shortened and simplified regimens. This study aimed to evaluate efficacy of Sofosbuvir and classify factors of treatment success and their function in therapy continuation decision. We studied host and viral factors in 310 patients who received Sofosbuvir (DAA) at a dose of 400 mg daily along with ribavirin 10 mg/kg body weight for 24 weeks and followed by 12 weeks after completion of treatment. A total of 302 patients (97.42%) showed end-of-treatment response. However, 8 patients (2.58%) were virological nonresponders and 286 patients (94.70%) achieved SVR. Among 310 HCV positive, the percentage of viral genotype 3-infected patients was 89.6%, whereas only 10.32% were affected by HCV genotype 1. Multivariable analysis showed that baseline HCV RNA (</=8 x 10(6) IU/mL vs. >8 x 10(6) IU/mL) [95% confidence interval (CI), odds ratio (OR) 3.0, 2.0 to 8.4; p = 0.004], age (<50 vs. >/=50 years) (95% CI, OR 1.9, 3.0 to 10.1; p = 0.03), liver texture (normal liver vs. coarse) are related to virological response. None of the patients included in the study has S282T substitution in NS5b of HCV. No significant difference in response was observed in patients with different genotypes of rs12979860. Liver texture, age, and viral load are predictors of SVR. In this real-life data no substitution of S282T in NS5b was observed related to failure of therapy. Oral Sofosbuvir generally has a high tolerance and can effortlessly beat the safety concerns of past regimens.
31067720<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>A Potent Antifungal Agent for Basal Stem Rot Disease Treatment in Oil Palms Based on Chitosan-Dazomet Nanoparticles.<<>>The use of nanotechnology could play a significant role in the agriculture sector, especially in the preparation of new-generation agronanochemicals. Currently, the economically important plant of Malaysia, the oil palm, faces the threat of a devastating disease which is particularly caused by a pathogenic fungus, Ganoderma boninense. For the development of an effective antifungal agent, a series of chitosan nanoparticles loaded with a fumigant, dazomet, were prepared using various concentrations of sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP)-2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg/mL, abbreviated as CDEN2.5, CDEN5, CDEN10, and CDEN20, respectively. The effect of TPP as a crosslinking agent on the resulting particle size of the synthesized nanoparticles was investigated using a particle size analyzer and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Both methods confirmed that increasing the TPP concentration resulted in smaller particles. In addition, in vitro fumigant release at pH 5.5 showed that the release of the fumigant from the nanoparticles was of a sustained manner, with a prolonged release time up to 24 h. Furthermore, the relationship between the chitosan-dazomet nanoparticles and the in vitro antifungal activity against G. boninense was also explored, where the nanoparticles of the smallest size, CDEN20, gave the highest antifungal efficacy with the lowest half maximum effective concentration (EC50) value of 13.7 +/- 1.76 ppb. This indicates that the smaller-sized agronanoparticles were more effective as an antifungal agent. The size can be altered, which plays a crucial role in combatting the Ganoderma disease. The agronanoparticles have controlled release properties and high antifungal efficacy on G. boninense, thus making them a promising candidate to be applied in the field for Ganoderma treatment.
31070171<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Prevalence of submicroscopic malaria in low transmission state of Punjab: A potential threat to malaria elimination.<<>>Background & objectives: Submicroscopic malaria infections with low parasite density serve as a silent reservoir for maintaining residual transmission in the population. These infections should be identified and targeted to be eliminated for sustained malaria control. The conventional methods of diagnosis such as light microscopy and rapid diagnostic kits often fail to detect low density infections. Therefore, the more sensitive molecular techniques should be employed to detect low density infections. The objectives of the study was to explore the prevalence of sub-microscopic infections in low transmission areas of Punjab using highly sensitive molecular tool. Methods: A total of 1114 finger prick blood samples were collected through active surveillance and tested for malaria diagnosis using light microscopy, RDT and PCR. Nested PCR amplification was performed using a pair of Plasmodium genus-specific primers from the 18S rRNA small subunit gene (18S rRNA). The amplified PCR products were analysed using a 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and observed under transilluminator. Results: Test positive rate (TPR) by microscopy, RDT and PCR was 4.4, 3.95 and 5.75%, respectively. Microscopy and RDT failed to detect mixed infections whereas 0.26% cases were found to be mixed infection in PCR. Compared to LM and RDT, PCR has detected 1.3% additional positive cases. However, of the total positive cases detected by PCR, 23.4% infections were found to be submicroscopic, which could not be detected by conventional methods of diagnosis. Interpretation & conclusions: The molecular study revealed the existence of submicroscopic malaria cases in the study population which would have remained undetected by conventional methods of diagnosis. This is particularly important because Punjab state is in malaria elimination phase and targeted to achieve elimination in 2021. However, such undetected parasite positive cases may pose bigger problem any time due to continued transmission. Therefore, application of more sensitive diagnostic tools like PCR and LAMP with conventional methods may be much more useful in case detection particularly in low transmission settings for malaria elimination.
29653498<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Neurotensin-loaded PLGA/CNC composite nanofiber membranes accelerate diabetic wound healing.<<>>Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a threat to human health and can lead to amputation and even death. Recently neurotensin (NT), an inflammatory modulator in wound healing, was found to be beneficial for diabetic wound healing. As we demonstrated previously, polylactide-polyglycolide (PLGA) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) (PLGA/CNC) nanofiber membranes show good cytocompatibility and facilitate fibroblast adhesion, spreading and proliferation. PLGA/CNC nanofiber membranes are novel materials that have not been used previously as NT carriers in diabetic wounds. This study aims to explore the therapeutic efficacy and possible mechanisms of NT-loaded PLGA/CNC nanofiber membranes in full-thickness skin wounds in spontaneously diabetic mice. The results showed that NT could be sustained released from NT-loaded PLGA/CNC composite nanofiber membranes for 2 weeks. NT-loaded PLGA/CNC composite nanofiber membranes induced more rapid healing than other control groups. After NT exposure, the histological scores of the epidermal and dermal regeneration and the ratios of the fibrotic area to the whole area were increased. NT-loaded PLGA/CNC composite nanofiber membranes also decreased the expressions of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-6. These results suggest that NT-loaded PLGA/CNC composite nanofiber membranes for sustained delivery of NT should effectively promote tissue regeneration for the treatment of DFUs.
18540756<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Greater sustained anxiety but not phasic fear in women compared to men.<<>>Startle reflex studies in rodents indicate that female are more reactive than rats in experimental models of sustained anxiety but not in models of phasic fear (Toufexis, 2007). This study examined evidence for a similar effect in humans. Participants were exposed to three conditions, (1) predictable aversive shocks signaled by a cue, (2) unpredictable shocks, and (3) no shocks. Acoustic startle stimuli were delivered regularly across conditions. Phasic startle potential to the threat cue in the predictable condition was not affected by sex. In contrast, and consistent with basic research, the sustained increase in startle in the predictable and unpredictable conditions was greater in women compared to men. Animal studies suggest that such an effect may be mediated by the effects of sexual dimorphism in limbic structures, including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. However, psychosocial factors may also contribute to this effect.
20136732<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>The interaction of anticipatory anxiety and emotional picture processing: an event-related brain potential study.<<>>The present study examined the interaction of anticipatory anxiety and selective emotion processing. Toward this end, a rapid stream of pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant pictures was presented in alternating blocks of threat-of-shock or safety, which were signaled by colored picture frames. The main finding is that pleasant pictures elicited a sustained negative difference potential over occipital regions during threat as compared to safety periods. In contrast, unpleasant and neutral picture processing did not vary as a function of threat-of-shock. Furthermore, in both the safety and threat-of-shock conditions, emotional pictures elicited an enlarged early posterior negativity and late positive potential. These data show that the activation of the fear/anxiety network exerts valence-specific effects on affective picture processing. Pleasant stimuli mismatching the current state of anticipatory anxiety apparently draw more attentional resources.
30875516<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Biomaterial surfaces self-defensive against bacteria by contact transfer of antimicrobials.<<>>Despite extensive engineering of tissue-contacting biomedical devices to control healing, these devices remain susceptible to bacterial colonization, biofilm formation, and chronic infection. The threat of selecting for resistance genes largely precludes sustained antimicrobial elution as a wide-spread clinical solution. In response, self-defensive surfaces have been developed where antimicrobial is released only when and where there is a bacterial challenge. We explore a new self-defensive approach using anionic microgels into which small-molecule cationic antimicrobials are loaded by complexation. We identify conditions where antimicrobial remains sequestered within the microgels for periods as long as weeks. However, bacterial contact triggers release and leads to local bacterial killing. We speculate that the close proximity of bacteria alters the local thermodynamic environment and interferes with the microgel-antimicrobial complexation. The contact-transfer approach does not require bacterial metabolism but instead appears to be driven by differences between the microgels and the bacterial cell envelope where there is a high concentration of negative charge and hydrophobicity. Contact with metabolizing macrophages or osteoblasts is, however, insufficient to trigger antimicrobial release, indicating that contact transfer can be specific to bacteria and suggesting an avenue to biomedical device surfaces that can simultaneously promote healing and resist infection.
28814474<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Role of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis in aversive learning and memory.<<>>Surviving threats in the environment requires brain circuits for detecting (or anticipating) danger and for coordinating appropriate defensive responses (e.g., increased cardiac output, stress hormone release, and freezing behavior). The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a critical interface between the "affective forebrain"-including the amygdala, ventral hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex-and the hypothalamic and brainstem areas that have been implicated in neuroendocrine, autonomic, and behavioral responses to actual or anticipated threats. However, the precise contribution of the BNST to defensive behavior is unclear, both in terms of the antecedent stimuli that mobilize BNST activity and the consequent defensive reactions. For example, it is well known that the BNST is essential for contextual fear conditioning, but dispensable for fear conditioning to discrete conditioned stimuli (CSs), at least as indexed by freezing behavior. However, recent evidence suggests that there are circumstances in which contextual freezing may persist independent of the BNST. Furthermore, the BNST is involved in the reinstatement (or relapse) of conditioned freezing to extinguished discrete CSs. As such, there are critical gaps in understanding how the BNST contributes to fundamental processes involved in Pavlovian fear conditioning. Here, we attempt to provide an integrative account of BNST function in fear conditioning. We discuss distinctions between unconditioned stress and conditioned fear and the role of BNST circuits in organizing behaviors associated with these states. We propose that the BNST mediates conditioned defensive responses-not based on the modality or duration of the antecedent threat or the duration of the behavioral response to the threat-but rather as consequence the ability of an antecedent stimulus to predict when an aversive outcome will occur (i.e., its temporal predictability). We argue that the BNST is not uniquely mobilized by sustained threats or uniquely involved in organizing sustained fear responses. In contrast, we argue that the BNST is involved in organizing fear responses to stimuli that poorly predict when danger will occur, no matter the duration, modality, or complexity of those stimuli. The concepts discussed in this review are critical to understanding the contribution of the human BNST to fear and anxiety disorders.
30923309<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Protracted amygdalar response predicts efficacy of a computer-based intervention targeting attentional patterns in transdiagnostic clinical anxiety.<<>>Individuals with clinical anxiety demonstrate an attention bias toward threatening information, which is thought to be partially driven by heightened amygdala activity to perceived threat. Attention Bias Modification (ABM) is a computer-based treatment that trains attention toward neutral stimuli and away from threatening stimuli. Alterations in initial processing of threat have been linked to ABM responses, but the impact of protracted processing in the aftermath of neutral and threatening information on ABM outcomes has not been well studied. Our study tested whether sustained activity in the amygdala, which occurred after neutral and threatening stimuli had been removed, could predict which individuals would respond well to ABM. Unmedicated anxious individuals underwent a baseline fMRI assessment during performance of a task sensitive to protracted emotional processing. Afterward, they were randomized to complete eight sessions of ABM (n = 38) or a sham training (n = 19). ABM patients who displayed greater sustained bilateral amygdalar response in the aftermath of neutral stimuli displayed the least improvement in self-reported (but not clinician-rated) vigilance symptoms. In contrast, amygdalar response did not predict improvement in sham patients. Results suggest that in certain anxious individuals, the amygdala may have a robust protracted response even to subjectively neutral cues, which could make these individuals a poor fit for ABM because of its focus on repeatedly retraining attention toward neutral cues. Findings may help elucidate neural mechanisms of ABM and promote the identification of a subset of anxious patients who would be good candidates for this intervention.
27059642<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>The impact of high trait social anxiety on neural processing of facial emotion expressions in females.<<>>A cognitive model of social anxiety predicts that an early attentional bias leads to greater cognitive processing of social threat signals, whereas the vigilance-avoidance model predicts there will be subsequent reduction in cognitive processing. This study tests these models by examining neural responses to social threat stimuli using Event-related potentials (ERP). 19 women with high trait social anxiety and 19 women with low trait social anxiety viewed emotional expressions (angry, disgusted, happy and neutral) in a passive viewing task whilst ERP responses were recorded. The HSA group revealed greater automatic attention, or hypervigilance, to all facial expressions, as indexed by greater N1 amplitude compared to the LSA group. They also showed greater sustained attention and elaborative processing of all facial expressions, indexed by significantly increased P2 and P3 amplitudes compared to the LSA group. These results support cognitive models of social anxiety, but are not consistent with predictions of the vigilance-avoidance model.
26090588<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Late-life anxiety is coming of age.<<>>Anxiety is an adaptive human experience that may occur at all ages and serves to help draw attention to, avoid or cope with immanent threat and danger. Given its evolutionary importance, it has strong genetic and biological underpinnings, and when it serves that adaptive function for the organism, anxiety may be viewed as useful. However, complex adaptive systems, such as our adaptation to threat or stress, by definition provide many and often interrelated points of breakdown or dysregulation, which, if sustained, may lead to psychopathology. Anxiety has been described as a common currency for psychopathology, indicating that it is a first line and universal way for us to respond to stress and threat. It is more or less prominent in patients diagnosed with practically all psychiatric or neurodegenerative disorders. This has lead to the inclusion of anxiety as a cross-cutting symptom measure in the development of DSM-5 (APA, 2013). Given that they are rooted in a complex adaptive system that has many potential points of impact to develop pathology, it is not surprising that anxiety disorders are extremely heterogeneous. This heterogeneity of anxiety disorders pertains to symptomatology, etiology and outcomes, and poses great challenges to both research and clinical practice.
18048004<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Failure to condition to a cue is associated with sustained contextual fear.<<>>The acquisition of a conditioned fear response is adaptive, as it enables the organism to appropriately respond to predictors of aversive events. Consequently, the absence of predictive cues can be used as a signal for safety. We aimed to study whether deficient fear conditioning might lead to maladaptive fear. Following previous work, we predicted that failure to learn the CS-US association would result in higher contextual fear, and that participants who failed to learn would tend to exhibit higher trait anxiety. Conditioning took place in a virtual environment with two contexts. In one of the two contexts, offset of a CS (light) was associated with a shock. Each participant visited two places (a house and an apartment) in each of 12 blocks. In one of these places shocks were administered at the offset of an 8-s period of lights on (CS). The results showed that half of the participants demonstrated differential shock expectancy between situations in the shock context in which the CS was present versus absent. This indicates that these participants learned the contingencies between the shocks and both the context and the light CS. In contrast, the other half of the participants learned only the association with the context. As predicted, learning the CS-US contingency resulted in reduced self-reported fear in the absence of the CS in the danger context compared to the presence of the CS. On the other hand, participants who failed to learn the association displayed a sustained aversive state throughout the duration of the danger context. Skin conductance measures confirmed this pattern of results. Fear-potentiated startle during the threat context compared to the safe context was significant in both groups, while startle was only potentiated during the CS in the threat context in the group that learned the CS association (trend-level significant). Finally, scores on Spielberger's self-report scale of trait anxiety tended to be higher in the group of participants who did not learn the CS-shock association in the danger context compared to participants who did. In conclusion, these results confirm higher contextual fear in participants who did not acquire a conditioned response to the cue in comparison to participants who did. Also, virtual reality contexts provide a useful tool for the study of context conditioning.
23471118<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>The impact of induced anxiety on response inhibition.<<>>Anxiety has wide reaching effects on cognition; evidenced most prominently by the "difficulties concentrating" seen in anxiety disorders, and by adaptive harm-avoidant behaviors adopted under threatening circumstances. Despite having critical implications for daily-living, the precise impact of anxiety on cognition is as yet poorly quantified. Here we attempt to clarify the impact of anxiety on sustained attention and response inhibition via a translational anxiety induction in healthy individuals (N = 22). Specifically, in a within-subjects design, participants completed the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) in which subjects withhold responses to infrequent no-go stimuli under threat of unpredictable electrical shock (anxious) and safe (non-anxious) conditions. Different studies have argued that this task measures either (1) attention lapses due to off-task thinking or (2) response inhibition; two cognitive functions which are likely impacted by anxiety. We show that threat of shock significantly reduces errors of commission on the no-go trials relative to the safe condition whilst having no effect on go trials or overall reaction time (RT). We suggest that this is because threat of shock during SART promotes response inhibition. In particular we argue that, by virtue of frequency, subjects acquire a habitual bias toward a go response which impairs no-go performance and that threat of shock improves the ability to withhold these prepotent responses. This improved response inhibition likely falls within the range of adaptive cognitive functions which promote cautious harm avoidance under threatening conditions, although a range of alternative explanations for this effect is discussed.
16703564<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Sustained B7/CD28 interactions and resultant phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity maintain G1-->S phase transitions at an optimal rate.<<>>Twenty-four hours of TCR engagement and CD28 costimulation was found sufficient to elicit an optimal rate of cell division over a 72-h period only when a high concentration of IL-2 was produced in the culture and remained readily available to the CD4(+) T cells. The cell division response could be aborted following 24 h of stimulation by the simultaneous abrogation of IL-2R signaling and the blockade of CD28 or TCR ligands. Biochemical and pharmacologic studies indicated that a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling cascade costimulated by the TCR and CD28 maintained the blasting cell division rate at a maximal level beyond 24 h even when IL-2 was withdrawn, neutralized, or exhausted. These data show that CD4(+) T cells remain sensitive to antigens (Ag) and costimulatory signals throughout the clonal expansion response. Furthermore, only those T cells that perceive the presence of a continued threat in the form of Ag/MHC complexes and B7 costimulatory ligands or a high concentration of a growth factor are directed to remain in cell cycle.
30788062<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Attention bias toward threatening faces in women with PTSD: eye tracking correlates by symptom cluster.<<>>Maladaptive patterns of attention to emotional stimuli are a common feature of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with growing evidence supporting sustained attention to threatening stimuli across trauma samples. However, it remains unclear how different PTSD symptom clusters are associated with attentional bias patterns, particularly in urban civilian settings with high rates of trauma exposure and PTSD. The present study examined associations among these variables in 70 traumatized primarily African American women. PTSD was measured using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, and eye tracking was used to measure patterns of attention as participants engaged in an attention bias (dot probe) task to emotional faces; average initial fixation (1 s) and dwell duration (overall time spent looking at emotional face versus neutral face across the 5 s task) were used to assess attention bias patterns toward emotional faces. Women with PTSD showed significantly longer dwell duration toward angry faces than women without PTSD (F = 5.16, p < .05). Bivariate correlation analyses with the PTSD symptom clusters showed a significant association between average initial fixation toward angry faces and higher levels of avoidance symptoms (r = 0.29, p < .05) as well as sustained attention to angry faces and higher levels of re-experiencing symptoms (r = 0.24, p < .05). Using separate linear regression models based on initial significant correlations, we found that PTSD avoidance symptoms were significantly related to average initial fixation toward angry faces (R (2) = 0.09, p < .05) and PTSD re-experiencing symptoms were significantly related to dwell duration toward angry faces (R (2) = 0.06, p < .05). These findings contribute to evidence that PTSD is related to both initial vigilance and sustained attention to threat and that certain symptom clusters may either drive or be more impacted by attentional biases, highlighting the benefits of addressing attentional biases within treatment.
22092068<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Integrated model for providing tactical emergency medicine support (TEMS): analysis of 120 tactical situations.<<>>BACKGROUND: Various models for organising tactical emergency medicine support (TEMS) in law enforcement operations exist. In Helsinki, TEMS is organised as an integral part of emergency medical service (EMS) and applied in hostage, siege, bomb threat and crowd control situations and in other tactical situations after police request. Our aim was to analyse TEMS operations, patient profile, and the level of on-site care provided. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of TEMS operations in Helsinki from 2004 to 2009. Data were retrieved from EMS, hospital and dispatching centre files and from TEMS reports. RESULTS: One hundred twenty TEMS operations were analysed. Median time from dispatching to arrival on scene was 10 min [Interquartile Range (IQR) 7-14]. Median duration of operations was 41 min (IQR 19-63). Standby was the only activity in 72 operations, four patients were dead on arrival, 16 requests were called off en route and patient examination or care was needed in 28 operations. Twenty-eight patients (records retrieved) were alive on arrival and were classified as trauma (n = 12) or medical (n = 16). Of traumas, two sustained a gunshot wound, one sustained a penetrating abdominal wound, three sustained medium severity injuries and nine sustained minor injuries. There was neither on-scene nor in-hospital mortality among patients who were alive on arrival. The level of on-site care performed was basic life support in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that TEMS integrated to daily EMS services including safe zone working only was a feasible, rapid and efficient way to provide medical support to law enforcement operations.
30853371<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Pretreatment with pyridostigmine bromide has no effect on seizure behavior or 24 hour survival in the rat model of acute diisopropylfluorophosphate intoxication.<<>>Acute intoxication with organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitors (OPs) is a significant human health threat, and current medical countermeasures for OP poisoning are of limited therapeutic efficacy. The rat model of acute intoxication with diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) is increasingly being used to test candidate compounds for efficacy in protecting against the immediate and long-term consequences of acute OP toxicity. In this model, rats are typically pretreated with pyridostigmine bromide (PB), a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor, to enhance survival. However, PB pretreatment is not likely in most scenarios of civilian exposure to acutely neurotoxic levels of OPs. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine whether PB pretreatment significantly increases survival in DFP-intoxicated rats. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were injected with DFP (4 mg/kg, s.c.) or vehicle (VEH) followed 1 min later by combined i.m. injection of atropine sulfate (2 mg/kg) and 2-pralidoxime (25 mg/kg). Animals were pretreated 30 min prior to these injections with PB (0.1 mg/kg, i.m.) or an equal volume of saline. DFP triggered rapid and sustained seizure behavior irrespective of PB pretreatment, and there was no significant difference in average seizure behavior score during the first 4 h following injection between DFP animals pretreated with PB or not. PB pretreatment also had no significant effect on survival or brain AChE activity at 24 h post-DFP exposure. In summary, PB pretreatment is not necessary to ensure survival of rats acutely intoxicated with DFP, and eliminating PB pretreatment in the rat model of acute DFP intoxication would increase its relevance to acute OP intoxication in civilians.
30909037<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Regional coral growth responses to seawater warming in the South China Sea.<<>>Seawater temperature is one of the main environmental factors controlling coral skeleton growth. Sustained seawater warming is regarded as a major threat to coral growth and reef development. Coral reefs are widespread in the South China Sea (SCS), where the history and future of coral growth are of great concern. We integrated 99 linear extension rate series of the coral Porites from 12 locations at three regions in SCS, which include the Hainan Island (HN), the Xisha Islands (XS), and the Huangyan Island-Nansha Islands (HY-NS), and explored the regional responses of coral growth to sustained seawater warming. The sea surface temperature (SST) rose linearly by 0.47 degrees C, 0.71 degrees C, and 0.76 degrees C at HN, XS, and HY-HN, respectively, between 1900 and 2014. During this period, coral growth increased linearly by ~21.0% and ~0.7% at HN and XS, while HY-NS saw a decline of ~2.8% in coral growth. Moreover, interdecadal variations were found for both SST and coral growth. A nonlinear response relationship was revealed between coral growth and SST, with a thermal optimum of ~27.5 degrees C for Porites, which is responsible for the regional difference in the long-term trend in coral growth in SCS. In recent decades, reductions in coral growth have occurred in SCS, especially at HN, with the largest fall of ~15.1% over the past century, which is attributed mainly to intensifying human impacts instead of seawater warming. A preliminary estimate presents regional-different coral growths in SCS by the end of 21st century, with declines of ~8.9-16.3% under the atmospheric CO2 emission scenario (RCP 8.5), implying that the overall downturn of coral growth will be inevitable under the future sustained seawater warming in SCS. The mitigation of global warming is essential to maintain coral growth and coral reef ecosystems in SCS.
26547015<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>A Scent of Anxiety: Olfactory Context Conditioning and its Influence on Social Cues.<<>>Perception and evaluation of objects are highly dependent on surrounding contexts. Threatening contexts enhance processing of faces. Because odors are assumed to deliver strong contextual information, the present study aimed at demonstrating 1) that odors can constitute threat and safety contexts, and 2) consequently modulate the processing of faces presented in these contexts. Therefore, previously neutral odors were used as contextual stimuli in a context conditioning paradigm, resulting in an olfactory anxiety and a safety context. Then, faces showing angry, neutral, or fearful expressions were presented within both contexts during a test phase to investigate the effects of threat versus safety contexts on face perception. The late positive potential (LPP) from the EEG, skin conductance level, and subjective ratings were recorded. Results reveal successful olfactory context conditioning as reflected in enhanced processing of the anxiety context, indicated by enhanced LPP after conditioning, increased skin conductance level, and marginally respectively increased ratings. Moreover, faces presented within the threat context were rated as more unpleasant and marginally more arousing than faces presented in the safety context. Thus, olfactory stimuli can serve as context in fear conditioning, and a threatening olfactory context seems to enhance processing of stimuli perceived within this context.
29328881<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Factors Affecting the Virological Response Among Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Patients in Yemen.<<>>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is increasingly seen as a major public health problem, threat, and concern worldwide. In Yemen about 1.7% of the population is infected with chronic hepatitis C. This study aimed to detect the predictors for response to pegylated interferon and ribavirin (Peg-IFN/RBV) in chronic HCV Yemeni patients. The study was conducted on 100 patients with chronic HCV who received Peg-IFN/RBV in the 48th Military Hospital in Sana'a Yemen, from 2011 to 2013. All patients were subjected to complete history taking, thorough clinical examinations, routine laboratory investigation, and abdominal ultrasonography. The HCV RNA was assessed at week 72 of treatment to detect whether the patient achieved sustained virological response (SVR). The SVR was achieved in 64% of the samples. Age above 40, Khat chewing, and obesity were the sociodemographic factors that predict good response for Peg-IFN/RBV combined therapy. Platelet count, alpha feto-protein (AFP), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels were the basic laboratory investigations that gave favorable response. Significant predictors of sustained response included: older than 40 years (OR = 0.136, P = 0.042), Khat chewer (OR = 0.016, P = 0.008), body mass index (BMI) (OR = 0.055, P = 0.029) and increase in fasting blood glucose (OR = 0.925, P = 0.004), alkaline phosphatase (OR = 0.969, P = 0.001), total and bilirubin (OR = 0.058, P = 0.017), AST (OR = 1.033, P = 0.002), and albumin (OR = 6.490, P = 0.021). Studying the independent variables of response, we revealed that male gender, BMI, ALT >40, AFP >10, viremia >600, and hemoglobin and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are variables associated with failure of end of treatment response (ETR) and SVR.
27023699<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Amphixenosic Aspects of Staphylococcus aureus Infection in Man and Animals.<<>>According to the mode of transmission, Staphylococcus aureus infection between hosts is classified as "direct zoonoses," or infection that is transmitted from an infected vertebrate host to a susceptible host (man) by direct contact, by contact with a fomite or by a mechanical vector. The agent itself undergoes little or no propagative or developmental changes during transmission. According to the reservoir host, staphylococcosis is most precisely defined as "zooanthroponoses" or infections transmitted from man to lower vertebrate animals (e.g., streptococci, diphtheria, Enterobacteriaceae, human tuberculosis in cattle and parrots), but also "anthropozoonoses" or infections transmitted to man from lower vertebrate animals. In particular, actually, the correct definition of S. aureus infections between humans and animals is "amphixenoses" or infections maintained in both man and lower vertebrate animals and transmitted in either direction. S. aureus exhibits tropisms to many distinct animal hosts. While spillover events can occur wherever there is an interface between host species, changes in host tropism only occur with the establishment of sustained transmission in the new host species, leading to clonal expansion. Although the genomic variation underpinning adaptation in S. aureus genotypes infecting bovids and poultry has been well characterized, the frequency of switches from one host to another remains obscure. In this review, we sought to identify the sustained switches in host tropism in the S. aureus population, both anthroponotic and zoonotic, and their distribution over the species phylogeny. S. aureus is an organism with the capacity to switch into and adapt to novel hosts, even after long periods of isolation in a single host species. Based on this evidence, animal-adapted S. aureus lineages exhibiting resistance to antibiotics must be considered a major threat to public health, as they can adapt to the human population.
28904564<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>The role of pre-reduction MRI in the management of complex cervical spine fracture-dislocations: an ongoing controversy?<<>>BACKGROUND: Cervical spine fracture-dislocations in neurologically intact patients represent a surgical challenge due to the risk of inflicting iatrogenic spinal cord compression by closed reduction maneuvers. The use of MRI for early advanced imaging in these injuries remains controversially debated. CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year old man sustained a fall over the handlebars of his racing bicycle. The helmeted patient sustained a fall on his head which resulted in a hyperflexion injury of the neck. He was neurologically intact on presentation. Initial CT imaging revealed a complex multisegmental cervical spine injury with a left-sided C6/C7 perched facet, a right sided C7/T1 fracture-dislocation, and a right-sided C6 and C7 traumatic laminotomy. The initial management consisted of temporary external Halo fixator application without closed reduction maneuver, to mitigate the risk of a delayed spinal cord injury. Subsequent advanced imaging by MRI revealed an acute traumatic C7/T1 disc herniation, with the intervertebral disc completely extruded into the spinal canal. Definitive surgical management was then accomplished by employing a three-stage anterior-posterior-anterior spinal decompression, realignment, fixation and fusion C4-T2 in one operative session. The patient recovered well and retained full neurological function. He resumed bicycle street racing within 10 months of the injury following successful spinal reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic evaluation of cervical fracture-dislocations should include advanced imaging by MRI in order to fully understand the injury pattern prior to proceeding with spinal reduction maneuvers which may impose the imminent threat of a devastating iatrogenic injury to the spinal cord. The presented staged management by initial Halo fixation without attempts for spinal reduction, followed by a surgical decompression and multilevel fusion, appears to represent a feasible and safe strategy for patients at risk of a delayed neurological injury.
16001610<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Protecting military convoys in Iraq: an examination of battle injuries sustained by a mechanized battalion during Operation Iraqi Freedom II.<<>>Improvised explosive devices and mines pose a formidable threat to military convoys traveling in Iraq. This study evaluated battle injuries sustained by a mechanized battalion operating against this threat. The objective was to gain insight into injury profiles and prevention. In the period examined, 32 attacks injured 120 Marines, causing 188 injuries. Upper extremity and head injuries (70%) were common, whereas lower extremity injuries (11%) were rare (as expected, given the threat and the body areas exposed). Shoulder and axilla protectors may be beneficial, but lower arm and hand injuries remain difficult to combat. Ear injury was the most common single injury type (23%). Combat earplugs may reduce ear blast injuries. Eye injuries were uncommon (0.5%), likely because of ballistic eye protection. Injury to the torso (11%) was generally mild, because of body armor vests. The majority of wounds were minor, allowing > 80% of the injured Marines to return to duty.
30872159<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Novel therapeutics for treating organophosphate-induced status epilepticus co-morbidities, based on changes in calcium homeostasis.<<>>Organophosphate (OP) chemicals include pesticides such as parathion, and nerve gases such as sarin and soman and are considered major chemical threat agents. Acute OP exposure is associated with a cholinergic crisis and status epilepticus (SE). It is also known that the survivors of OP toxicity exhibit neurobehavioral deficits such as mood changes, depression, and memory impairment, and acquired epilepsy. Our research has focused on addressing the need to develop effective therapeutic agents that could be administered even after prolonged seizures and would prevent or lessen the chronic morbidity associated with OP-SE survival. We have developed rat survival models of OP pesticide metabolite paraoxon (POX) and nerve agent sarin surrogate diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) induced SE that are being used to screen for medical countermeasures against an OP attack. Our research has focused on studying neuronal calcium (Ca(2+)) homeostatic mechanisms for identifying mechanisms and therapeutics for the expression of neurological morbidities associated with OP-SE survival. We have observed development of a "Ca(2+) plateau" characterized by sustained elevations in neuronal Ca(2+) levels in OP-SE surviving rats that coincided with the appearance of OP-SE chronic morbidities. These Ca(2+) elevations had their origin in Ca(2+) release from the intracellular stores such that blockade with antagonists like dantrolene, carisbamate, and levetiracetam lowered OP-SE mediated Ca(2+) plateau and afforded significant neuroprotection. Since the Ca(2+) plateau lasts for a prolonged period, our studies suggest that blocking it after the control of SE may represent a unique target for development of novel countermeasures to prevent long term Ca(2+) mediated OP-SE neuropsychiatric comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, and acquired epilepsy (AE).
27786459<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Injectable and Thermosensitive Hydrogel Containing Liraglutide as a Long-Acting Antidiabetic System.<<>>Diabetes, a global epidemic, has become a serious threat to public health. The present study is aimed at constructing an injectable thermosensitive PEG-polyester hydrogel formulation of liraglutide (Lira), a "smart" antidiabetic polypeptide, in the long-acting treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of three thermosensitive poly(epsilon-caprolactone-co-glycolic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(epsilon-caprolactone-co-glycolic acid) (PCGA-PEG-PCGA) triblock copolymers with similar molecular weights but different epsilon-caprolactone-to-glycolide (CL-to-GA) ratios were synthesized. The polymer aqueous solutions exhibited free-flowing sols at room temperature and formed in situ hydrogels at body temperature. While the different bulk morphologies, stabilities of aqueous solutions, and the varying in vivo persistence time of hydrogels in ICR mice were found among the three copolymers, all of the Lira-loaded gel formulations exhibited a sustained drug release manner in vitro regardless of CL-to-GA ratios. The specimen with a powder form in the bulk state, a stable aqueous solution before heating, and an appropriate degradation rate in vivo was selected as the optimal carrier to evaluate the in vivo efficacy. A single injection of the optimal gel formulation showed a remarkable hypoglycemic efficacy up to 1 week in diabetic db/db mice. Furthermore, three successive administrations of this gel formulation within one month significantly lowered glycosylated hemoglobin and protected islets of db/db mice. As a result, a promising once-weekly delivery system of Lira was developed, which not only afforded long-term glycemic control but also significantly improved patient compliance.
26663379<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>The neuroscience and context of adolescent depression.<<>>UNLABELLED: Adolescent depression is a growing public health concern with an increased risk of negative health outcomes, including suicide. The use of antidepressants and psychotherapy has not halted its increasing prevalence, and there is a critical need for effective prevention and treatment. We reviewed the neuroscience of adolescent depression, with a focus on the neurocircuitry of sustained threat and summarised contextual factors that have an impact on brain development and the pathophysiology of depression. We also reviewed novel treatment models. CONCLUSION: Attention to the relevant neurocircuitry and contextual factors implicated in adolescent depression is necessary to advance prevention and treatment development.
29891983<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Genetic diversity and transmissibility of imported Plasmodium vivax in Qatar and three countries of origin.<<>>Malaria control program in the Arabian Peninsula, backed by adequate logistical support, has interrupted transmission with exception of limited sites in Saudi Arabia and sporadic outbreaks in Oman. However, sustained influx of imported malaria represents a direct threat to the above success. Here we examined the extent of genetic diversity among imported P. vivax in Qatar, and its ability to produce gametocytes, compared to parasites in main sites of imported cases, the Indian subcontinent (india) and East Africa (Sudan and Ethiopia). High diversity was seen among imported P. vivax in Qatar, comparable to parasites in the Indian subcontinent and East Africa. Limited genetic differentiation was seen among imported P. vivax, which overlapped with parasites in India, but differentiated from that in Sudan and Ethiopia. Parasite density among imported cases, ranged widely between 26.25-7985934.1 Pv18S rRNA copies/microl blood, with a high prevalence of infections carried gametocytes detectable by qRT-PCR. Parasitaemia was a stronger predictor for P. vivax gametocytes density (r = 0.211, P = 0.04). The extensive diversity of imported P. vivax and its ability to produce gametocytes represent a major threat for re-introduction of malaria in Qatar. The genetic relatedness between P. vivax reported in Qatar and those in India suggest that elimination strategy should target flow and dispersal of imported malaria into the region.
29503978<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>The Neurobiological Mechanisms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Chronic Stress.<<>>Two classification systems are now at the forefront of clinical psychiatric research: (1) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition and (2) the National Institutes of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria. Herein, we propose that these two classification systems are complementary rather than mutually exclusive, and when combined provide important information for understanding aspects of the pathophysiology related to Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). The neurobiological literature for GAD and one relevant research domain criteria component, sustained threat, are reviewed from multiple units of analysis (genetic, neuroimaging, neuroendocrine, and psychophysiological). It is hypothesized that generating a comprehensive, biologically based understanding of the relationship between GAD, sustained threat, and the measureable units of analysis will provide information critical to design the most effective treatments.
15172133<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Functionally dissociated aspects in anterior and posterior electrocortical processing of facial threat.<<>>The angry facial expression is an important socially threatening stimulus argued to have evolved to regulate social hierarchies. In the present study, event-related potentials (ERP) were used to investigate the involvement and temporal dynamics of the frontal and parietal regions in the processing of angry facial expressions. Angry, happy and neutral faces were shown to eighteen healthy right-handed volunteers in a passive viewing task. Stimulus-locked ERPs were recorded from the frontal and parietal scalp sites. The P200, N300 and early contingent negativity variation (eCNV) components of the electric brain potentials were investigated. Analyses revealed statistical significant reductions in P200 amplitudes for the angry facial expression on both frontal and parietal electrode sites. Furthermore, apart from being strongly associated with the anterior P200, the N300 showed to be more negative for the angry facial expression in the anterior regions also. Finally, the eCNV was more pronounced over the parietal sites for the angry facial expressions. The present study demonstrated specific electrocortical correlates underlying the processing of angry facial expressions in the anterior and posterior brain sectors. The P200 is argued to indicate valence tagging by a fast and early detection mechanism. The lowered N300 with an anterior distribution for the angry facial expressions indicates more elaborate evaluation of stimulus relevance. The fact that the P200 and the N300 are highly correlated suggests that they reflect different stages of the same anterior evaluation mechanism. The more pronounced posterior eCNV suggests sustained attention to socially threatening information.
29353055<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) signaling in the prefrontal cortex modulates cued fear learning, but not spatial working memory, in female rats.<<>>A genetic polymorphism within the gene encoding the pituitary adenylate cyclase- activating polypeptide (PACAP) receptor type I (PAC1R) has recently been associated with hyper-reactivity to threat-related cues in women, but not men, with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PACAP is a highly conserved peptide, whose role in mediating adaptive physiological stress responses is well established. Far less is understood about the contribution of PACAP signaling in emotional learning and memory, particularly the encoding of fear to discrete cues. Moreover, a neurobiological substrate that may account for the observed link between PAC1R and PTSD in women, but not men, has yet to be identified. Sex differences in PACAP signaling during emotional learning could provide novel targets for the treatment of PTSD. Here we investigated the contribution of PAC1R signaling within the prefrontal cortex to the acquisition of cued fear in female and male rats. We used a variant of fear conditioning called trace fear conditioning, which requires sustained attention to fear cues and depends on working-memory like neuronal activity within the prefrontal cortex. We found that cued fear learning, but not spatial working memory, was impaired by administration of a PAC1R antagonist directly into the prelimbic area of the prefrontal cortex. This effect was specific to females. We also found that levels of mRNA for the PAC1R receptor in the prelimbic cortex were greater in females compared with males, and were highest during and immediately following the proestrus stage of the estrous cycle. Together, these results demonstrate a sex-specific role of PAC1R signaling in learning about threat-related cues.
18058089<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Models and mechanisms of anxiety: evidence from startle studies.<<>>RATIONALE: Preclinical data indicates that threat stimuli elicit two classes of defensive behaviors, those that are associated with imminent danger and are characterized by flight or fight (fear), and those that are associated with temporally uncertain danger and are characterized by sustained apprehension and hypervigilance (anxiety). OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the study are to (1) review evidence for a distinction between fear and anxiety in animal and human experimental models using the startle reflex as an operational measure of aversive states, (2) describe experimental models of anxiety, as opposed to fear, in humans, (3) examine the relevance of these models to clinical anxiety. RESULTS: The distinction between phasic fear to imminent threat and sustained anxiety to temporally uncertain danger is suggested by psychopharmacological and behavioral evidence from ethological studies and can be traced back to distinct neuroanatomical systems, the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Experimental models of anxiety, not fear, are relevant to non-phobic anxiety disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Progress in our understanding of normal and abnormal anxiety is critically dependent on our ability to model sustained aversive states to temporally uncertain threat.
27079532<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Dynamic competition between large-scale functional networks differentiates fear conditioning and extinction in humans.<<>>The high evolutionary value of learning when to respond to threats or when to inhibit previously learned associations after changing threat contingencies is reflected in dedicated networks in the animal and human brain. Recent evidence further suggests that adaptive learning may be dependent on the dynamic interaction of meta-stable functional brain networks. However, it is still unclear which functional brain networks compete with each other to facilitate associative learning and how changes in threat contingencies affect this competition. The aim of this study was to assess the dynamic competition between large-scale networks related to associative learning in the human brain by combining a repeated differential conditioning and extinction paradigm with independent component analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data. The results (i) identify three task-related networks involved in initial and sustained conditioning as well as extinction, and demonstrate that (ii) the two main networks that underlie sustained conditioning and extinction are anti-correlated with each other and (iii) the dynamic competition between these two networks is modulated in response to changes in associative contingencies. These findings provide novel evidence for the view that dynamic competition between large-scale functional networks differentiates fear conditioning from extinction learning in the healthy brain and suggest that dysfunctional network dynamics might contribute to learning-related neuropsychiatric disorders.
24611591<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Social anxiety and the accuracy of predicted affect.<<>>Social anxiety is theorised to arise from sustained over-activation of a mammalian evolved system for detecting and responding to social threat with corresponding diminished opportunities for attaining the pleasure of safe attachments. Emotional forecasting data from two holidays were used to test the hypothesis that greater social anxiety would be associated with decreased expectations of positive affect (PA) and greater anticipated negative affect (NA) on a holiday marked by group celebration (St. Patrick's Day) while being associated with greater predicted PA for daters on a romantic holiday (Valentine's Day). Participants completed symptom reports, made affective forecasts and provided multiple affect reports throughout each holiday. Higher levels of social anxiety were associated with greater anticipated PA for Valentine's Day daters, but lower experienced PA on the holiday; this was not found for trait anxiety and depression. Alternatively, trait anxiety, depression and social anxiety were associated with less predicted PA for St. Patrick's Day, greater anticipated NA and diminished experienced PA/greater NA during the holiday. Results are discussed in light of perceived hope for rewarding safe emotional contact for those daters in contrast to the greater possibility for social threat associated with group celebration typical of St. Patrick's Day.
28680667<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>The impact of induced anxiety on affective response inhibition.<<>>Studying the effects of experimentally induced anxiety in healthy volunteers may increase our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning anxiety disorders. Experimentally induced stress (via threat of unpredictable shock) improves accuracy at withholding a response on the sustained attention to response task (SART), and in separate studies improves accuracy to classify fearful faces, creating an affective bias. Integrating these findings, participants at two public science engagement events (n = 46, n = 55) were recruited to explore the effects of experimentally induced stress on an affective version of the SART. We hypothesized that we would see an improved accuracy at withholding a response to affectively congruent stimuli (i.e. increased accuracy at withholding a response to fearful 'no-go' distractors) under threat of shock. Induced anxiety slowed reaction time, and at the second event quicker responses were made to fearful stimuli. However, we did not observe improved inhibition overall during induced anxiety, and there was no evidence to suggest an interaction between induced anxiety and stimulus valence on response accuracy. Indeed Bayesian analysis provided decisive evidence against this hypothesis. We suggest that the presence of emotional stimuli might make the safe condition more anxiogenic, reducing the differential between conditions and knocking out any threat-potentiated improvement.
10820677<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Israel under threat of biological warfare--the reactions of our patients during the 1998 Persian Gulf crisis.<<>>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: During February 1998, there was heightened tension in the Persian Gulf area. Iraq's ruler, Saddam Hussein, threatened Israeli citizens with the use of biological weapons. This study observed the use of health care services by patients visiting our clinics during this period. METHODS: During the period of February 17, 1998, through March 1, 1998, 12 family physicians classified all clinic visits as "related" or "unrelated" to the crisis. The participating clinics were situated in (A) high-risk and (B) low-risk areas, according to their location as related to missile hits during the 1991 Gulf War. RESULTS: A total of 1,841 visits were recorded during the crisis period (February 17-23). There were 934 visits in Area A and 907 in Area B. Overall, 194 visits related to the crisis were recorded, of which 155 were in Area A. The rate of crisis-related visits was higher in Area A (16.6% versus 3.4%). There were more visits for authorizations for special masks (8.2% versus .8%), requests for information (3.9% versus 1.3%), and tranquilizers (2.1% versus .5%). In the period subsequent to the agreement reached on February 24, crisis-related visits declined sharply in both areas. CONCLUSIONS: During the crisis, there was an increase in visits related to the threat of biological warfare. The phenomenon was more pronounced in areas that had sustained missile hits during the 1991 Gulf War.
30538603<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Care of Patients Following Cure of Hepatitis C Virus Infection.<<>>The vast majority of persons with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection will achieve virologic cure with the current direct-acting antiviral therapies. Prevention of reinfection is an important aspect of postcure management and key to the elimination of HCV infection globally. Equally important aspects of postcure care are the prevention of liver disease progression and the management of complications in patients who have significant fibrosis at the time of achieving cure. Patients with advanced fibrosis need to remain under surveillance for liver complications, including hepatocellular carcinoma. All patients are potentially at risk for liver disease progression if other factors causing liver injury are present, such as harmful levels of alcohol use or risk factors for fatty liver including obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic comorbidities. Fatty liver is a particular threat to the long-term well-being of patients after HCV cure due to the high prevalence of its risk factors in this population. Strong counseling messages and ongoing monitoring are key.
28121714<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Hepatitis delta and HIV infection.<<>>Viral liver diseases are frequent comorbidities and major contributors to death in HIV-positive individuals on antiretroviral therapy. Although cure of hepatitis C and control of hepatitis B with antivirals avert liver disease progression in most HIV-coinfected patients, the lack of satisfactory treatment for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection remains a major threat for developing cirrhosis and liver cancer in this population. In the European Union (EU) and North America, sexual contact has replaced injection drug use that has been the major transmission route for HDV in HIV-positive persons. PegIFNalpha is the only approved HDV therapy; however, sustained HDV-RNA clearance is achieved by less than 25%. The recent discovery of sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide as the key hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV cell entry receptor has opened the door to a new therapeutic era. Indeed, promising results have been released using Myrcludex-B, a sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide inhibitor. More encouraging are data with new classes of HDV blockers, such as prenylation inhibitors (i.e. lonafarnib) and nucleic acid polymers. At this time, sustained suppression of HDV replication is the primary goal of HDV therapy, as it is associated with normalization of liver enzymes and histological improvement. Of note, the use of specific antivirals for HDV must be given along with anti-HBV agents to prevent HBV rebounds following removal of viral interference. The lack of persistent forms of HDV-RNA could provide a unique opportunity for curing hepatitis delta, even without eliminating HBV circular covalently closed DNA. Ultimately, suppression of HDV replication along with hepatitis B surface antigen clearance once drugs are off would be the best reflect of hepatitis delta cure.
30886619<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Dendritic Cell Responses and Function in Malaria.<<>>Malaria remains a serious threat to global health. Sustained malaria control and, eventually, eradication will only be achieved with a broadly effective malaria vaccine. Yet a fundamental lack of knowledge about how antimalarial immunity is acquired has hindered vaccine development efforts to date. Understanding how malaria-causing parasites modulate the host immune system, specifically dendritic cells (DCs), key initiators of adaptive and vaccine antigen-based immune responses, is vital for effective vaccine design. This review comprehensively summarizes how exposure to Plasmodium spp. impacts human DC function in vivo and in vitro. We have highlighted the heterogeneity of the data observed in these studies, compared and critiqued the models used to generate our current understanding of DC function in malaria, and examined the mechanisms by which Plasmodium spp. mediate these effects. This review highlights potential research directions which could lead to improved efficacy of existing vaccines, and outlines novel targets for next-generation vaccine strategies to target malaria.
28473701<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Anxious laughter: Mauron's Renversement and Gogol's Overcoat.<<>>Inside and outside of psychoanalysis, laughter has often been thought of as relating to anxiety, with the usual line being that laughter can be a response to anxiety or a way of dealing with it. This article argues that laughter cannot be said to eradicate or 'deal with' anxiety and that laughter is always unsettling precisely because it contains anxiety and indicates its continuing threat. The article discusses Freud and Lacan on anxiety, as well as Charles Mauron, an understudied writer whose Psychocritique du Genre Comique was the only sustained study of psychoanalysis and comedy until very recently. I argue here that Mauron's idea of renversement holds a key to understanding the relationship between laughter and anxiety. Rather than using a collection of isolated examples to illustrate individual points, in the second half of the article I provide a more sustained discussion of these ideas in relation to Nicolai Gogol's short story "The Overcoat."
25816797<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Aggression proneness: Transdiagnostic processes involving negative valence and cognitive systems.<<>>Aggressive behavior is observed in persons with various mental health problems and has been studied from the perspectives of neuroscience and psychophysiology. The present research reviews some of the extant experimental literature to help clarify the interplay between domains of functioning implicated in aggression proneness. We then convey a process-oriented model that elucidates how the interplay of the Negative Valence and Cognitive System domains of NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) helps explain aggression proneness, particularly reactive aggression. Finally, we report on a study involving event-related potential (ERP) indices of emotional and inhibitory control processing during an emotional-linguistic go/no-go task among 67 individuals with histories of violence and criminal offending (30% female, 44% African-American) who reported on their aggressive tendencies using the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire. Results provide evidence that tendencies toward angry and aggressive behavior relate to reduced inhibitory control processing (no-go P3) specifically during relevant threat-word blocks, suggesting deterioration of cognitive control by acute or sustained threat sensitivity. These findings highlight the value of ERP methodologies for clarifying the interplay of Negative Valence and Cognitive System processes in aggression proneness.
28502443<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Hepatitis B and C.<<>>Chronic viral hepatitis is a global health threat and financial burden. Hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV) are the most common causes of chronic viral hepatitis in the United States. Most cases are asymptomatic before adulthood. Research has resulted in effective therapy for HCV and the promise of effective therapies for HBV. For HCV, therapy is pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Clinical trials with effective direct-acting antiviral agents are underway in pediatrics. For HBV, approved agents are alpha-interferon, lamivudine, adefovir, tenofovir, and entecavir. However, treatment seldom results in functional cure and more effective therapies are urgently needed.
30081708<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>The global burden and epidemiology of invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella infections.<<>>Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease has emerged as a major public health concern. Yet, understanding of the global burden is incomplete, limited particularly by the breadth of blood culture-based surveillance systems that are able to accurately diagnose the etiology of bacteremia. The accessibility of whole genome sequencing has allowed for genetic characterization of pathogens, shedding light on its evolutionary history and sounding alerts for its future progression. iNTS disease is observed to be a particular threat in sub-Saharan Africa, with a case fatality rate greatly exceeding that of typhoid fever, and commonly affecting infants, young children and immunocompromised adults. While iNTS disease might also be a threat in Asia and Latin America, its burden is not well characterized, primarily owing to the lack of comprehensive reporting in these regions. Drug-resistant Salmonella enterica (S. enterica) serovars (e.g. Typhimurium sequence type 313 (ST313)) have emerged as a potential consequence of sustained antibiotic pressure. Genetic analyses have identified distinguished iNTS disease-causing strains that are particularly virulent in certain human host populations. Effective treatment strategies, including vaccination, are necessary; iNTS vaccines targeting the most common S. enterica serovars, Typhimurium, Enteritidis and Dublin, are currently in early developmental stages. Funding and political support is needed to promote vaccine development and implementation programs to ultimately reduce the threat of iNTS disease in high risk areas.
27474132<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>An Overly Permissive Extension.<<>>In this article, I describe how the current practice of classifying as a stressor any event that is accompanied by a change in any of a number of biological or behavioral measures-even when it is not accompanied by a long-term compromise in an organism's health or capacity to cope with daily challenges-has limited the utility of this concept. This permissive posture, which began with Selye's writings more than 65 years ago, is sustained by the public's desire for a simple term that might explain the tension generated by the threat of terrorists, growing economic inequality, increased competiveness in the workplace or for admission to the best universities, rogue nuclear bombs, and media reports of threats to health in food and water. I believe that the concept stress should be limited to select events that pose a serious threat to an organism's well-being or discarded as too ambiguous to be theoretically useful.
26403599<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Unpleasant stimuli differentially modulate inhibitory processes in an emotional Go/NoGo task: an event-related potential study.<<>>Threat stimuli typically elicit a psychophysiological response pattern supporting the organism's preparation for active defence. Differently, blood stimuli prompt a distinctive autonomic response pattern and sustained processing, which do not call for clear-cut mobilisation for action. However, the contribution of motor disposition in these response patterns remains unclear. One way to address this issue is to investigate whether threat and blood stimuli differentially affect the active suppression of an ongoing motor activity. Thirty-two undergraduates were presented with threat, mutilation, pleasant, and neutral pictures in an emotional Go/NoGo task. The amplitudes of the NoGo-N2 and NoGo-P3 components of the event-related potentials were analysed as indices of conflict monitoring and inhibition of motor response, respectively. Reaction times to Go trials were significantly faster for threat than for mutilations. The NoGo-N2 was significantly larger to threat than to mutilations, whereas the NoGo-P3amplitude did not differ between the two conditions. These findings suggest that threat stimuli facilitated the execution of a prepotent response and enhanced conflict monitoring when action must be withheld. In contrast, blood stimuli did not either promote action in the Go trials or increase conflict in the NoGo condition, suggesting a response pattern compatible with defensive immobility.
30529716<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Resting amygdala connectivity and basal sympathetic tone as markers of chronic hypervigilance.<<>>BACKGROUND: Chronic hypervigilance, a state of sustained alertness and hyperarousal in the absence of threat, has been shown to predict poorer clinical outcomes post-trauma. An exaggerated and persistent amygdala alerting response to affective information has been proposed as a reactivity-based, and thus indirect, marker of hypervigilance. However, because chronic hypervigilance is a persistent rather than reactive state, it should be directly observable under resting-state conditions without the need for exposure to affectively charged stimuli. OBJECTIVE: We tested resting amygdala connectivity and basal sympathetic and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity as direct neural and neuroendocrine markers of chronic hypervigilance. PARTICIPANTS: 24 trauma-exposed women (age M = 22.9, SD = 5.5) and 20 no-trauma controls (age M = 21.1, SD = 3.2). MEASURES: Amygdala connectivity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging at rest and during viewing of novel and familiar affective scenes. Elevated amygdala connectivity during the viewing of novel scenes (exaggerated alerting response) and familiar scenes (persistent alerting response) was used as a reactivity-based index of hypervigilance. Resting amygdala connectivity and basal salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) and cortisol were tested as neural and neuroendocrine markers of hypervigilance, respectively. RESULTS: Compared to no-trauma controls, trauma-exposed women showed greater connectivity between the left amygdala and the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) both during affective processing and at rest. Exaggerated neural novelty response was associated with greater resting left amygdala-vACC connectivity and higher basal sAA, but not cortisol. CONCLUSIONS: Greater synchronization of threat-detection circuitry in the absence of threat and basal sympathetic tone might serve as complementary resting-state markers of the cognitive and physiological components of chronic hypervigilance, respectively.
25943264<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Enhanced Neural Reactivity to Threatening Faces in Anxious Youth: Evidence from Event-Related Potentials.<<>>Anxiety disorders are characterized by enhanced reactivity to threat, and event-related potentials (ERPs) are useful neural measures of the dynamics of threat processing. In particular, the late positive potential (LPP) is an ERP component that reflects sustained attention towards motivationally salient information. Previous studies in adults suggest that the LPP is enhanced to threatening stimuli in anxiety but blunted in depression; however, very little work has evaluated the LPP to threat in anxious youth. We measured the LPP during an emotional face-matching task in youth (age 7-19) with current anxiety disorders (n = 53) and healthy controls with no history of psychopathology (n = 37). We evaluated group differences, as well as the effect of depressive symptoms on the LPP. Youth with anxiety disorders exhibited enhanced LPPs to angry and fearful faces 1000-2000 ms after stimulus onset. Higher depressive symptoms were associated with reduced LPPs to angry faces across both groups. Enhanced LPPs to threatening faces were most apparent for social anxiety disorder, as opposed to generalized anxiety disorder or separation anxiety disorder. Results suggest the LPP may be a useful neural measure of threat reactivity in youth with anxiety disorders and highlight the importance of accounting for symptoms of both depression and anxiety when examining emotional processing.
28158672<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Face-to-face: Perceived personal relevance amplifies face processing.<<>>The human face conveys emotional and social information, but it is not well understood how these two aspects influence face perception. In order to model a group situation, two faces displaying happy, neutral or angry expressions were presented. Importantly, faces were either facing the observer, or they were presented in profile view directed towards, or looking away from each other. In Experiment 1 (n = 64), face pairs were rated regarding perceived relevance, wish-to-interact, and displayed interactivity, as well as valence and arousal. All variables revealed main effects of facial expression (emotional > neutral), face orientation (facing observer > towards > away) and interactions showed that evaluation of emotional faces strongly varies with their orientation. Experiment 2 (n = 33) examined the temporal dynamics of perceptual-attentional processing of these face constellations with event-related potentials. Processing of emotional and neutral faces differed significantly in N170 amplitudes, early posterior negativity (EPN), and sustained positive potentials. Importantly, selective emotional face processing varied as a function of face orientation, indicating early emotion-specific (N170, EPN) and late threat-specific effects (LPP, sustained positivity). Taken together, perceived personal relevance to the observer-conveyed by facial expression and face direction-amplifies emotional face processing within triadic group situations.
12411265<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Mental disorder and perceived threat to the public: people who do not return to community living.<<>>BACKGROUND: In the UK, people with mental disorder thought to pose a high risk of harm to others are usually put in a high-security (special) hospital. Little is known about what happens after that. AIMS: To test a hypothesis that, under current services and laws (from the mid-1980s), no one leaving high-security hospitals remains indefinitely institutionalised. METHOD: The special hospitals' case register was used for case ascertainment and admission data; post-discharge data were collected from multiple sources on patients discharged in 1984 (census date 31.12.1995). RESULTS: In this discharge cohort (n=223), 36 (17%) did not return to the community: 17 died in special hospital and 19 continuously lived in other institutions until death or the census date. Over two-thirds of these had mental illness, were older on admission and had lived longer in special hospital than their better-rehabilitated peers. Offending history was irrelevant to this. Most post-discharge institution time was in open psychiatric hospital, or back in special hospital, not in medium secure units or prison. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis was not sustained, but fewer people never reached the community than before the mid-1980s. Atypical antipsychotics might reduce this number. We found no justification for a new tier of long-term medium secure units.
27026127<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Development of a Field-Deployable Psychomotor Vigilance Test to Monitor Helicopter Pilot Performance.<<>>INTRODUCTION: Flying a helicopter is a complex psychomotor skill. Fatigue is a serious threat to operational safety, particularly for sustained helicopter operations involving high levels of cognitive information processing and sustained time on task. As part of ongoing research into this issue, the object of this study was to develop a field-deployable helicopter-specific psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) for the purpose of daily performance monitoring of pilots. METHODS: The PVT consists of a laptop computer, a hand-operated joystick, and a set of rudder pedals. Screen-based compensatory tracking task software includes a tracking ball (operated by the joystick) which moves randomly in all directions, and a second tracking ball which moves horizontally (operated by the rudder pedals). The 5-min test requires the pilot to keep both tracking balls centered. RESULTS: This helicopter-specific PVT's portability and integrated data acquisition and storage system enables daily field monitoring of the performance of individual helicopter pilots. The inclusion of a simultaneous foot-operated tracking task ensures divided attention for helicopter pilots as the movement of both tracking balls requires simultaneous inputs. DISCUSSION: This PVT is quick, economical, easy to use, and specific to the operational flying task. It can be used for performance monitoring purposes, and as a general research tool for investigating the psychomotor demands of helicopter operations. While reliability and validity testing is warranted, data acquired from this test could help further our understanding of the effect of various factors (such as fatigue) on helicopter pilot performance, with the potential of contributing to helicopter operational safety.
24732260<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Nanostructured drug delivery for better management of tuberculosis.<<>>With almost 30% of the world population suffering from tuberculosis (TB) including its resurgence in the developed world, better management of this global threat is highly desired. The emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) against first-line drugs and extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) due to misuse of second-line antitubercular drugs (ATDs) is a further concern. Recommended treatment involves long term and multiple drug therapy with severe side effects. In this context, nanostructured systems efficiently encapsulating considerable amounts of ATDs, eliciting controlled, sustained and more profound effect to overcome the need to administer ATDs at high and frequent doses, would assist in improving patient compliance and circumvent hepatotoxicity and/or nephrotoxicity/ocular toxicity/ototoxicity associated with the prevalent first-line chemotherapy. Nanostructured delivery systems constitute a wide range of systems varying from liposomes, micelles, micro- and nanoemulsions, to polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs). Improved bioavailability, solubility, stability and biocompatibility make them an ideal choice for delivery of ATDs. Present review comprehensively covers research carried out on first-line antitubercular drug therapy using these nanostructured systems.
28814466<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Interaction of induced anxiety and verbal working memory: influence of trait anxiety.<<>>This study examines the influence of trait anxiety on working memory (WM) in safety and threat. Interactions between experimentally induced anxiety and WM performance (on different cognitive loads) have been reported in healthy, nonanxious subjects. Differences in trait anxiety may moderate these interactions. Accordingly, these interactions may be potentiated by high trait anxiety (HTA), or show a resilient pattern that protects cognitive performance. HTA and low trait anxiety (LTA) were defined by a median split of scores on the trait component of the state-trait anxiety inventory. Sustained anxiety was evoked by a probabilistic exposure to an aversive scream, and was measured by eyeblink startle and self-report. WM was tested using an n-back task (1-, 2-, and 3-back). Results revealed that, as expected, the HTA group reported greater anxiety during the task. However, trait anxiety did not impact the modulation of WM performance by induced anxiety. Notably, HTA influenced anxiety-potentiated startle (startle during threat minus startle during safe; APS) differently as a function of memory load. Accordingly, APS decreased with increasing WM load, but HTA antagonized this reduction. The HTA group showed no impairment on the 3-back WM task despite a higher APS. The amplified APS could be associated with the increase in effort-related cognitive arousal. Furthermore, this third replication of the interaction of induced anxiety by load on WM performance testifies to the robustness of the unique interplay between anxiety and WM.
9174398<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>A threat in the air. How stereotypes shape intellectual identity and performance.<<>>A general theory of domain identification is used to describe achievement barriers still faced by women in advanced quantitative areas and by African Americans in school. The theory assumes that sustained school success requires identification with school and its subdomains; that societal pressures on these groups (e.g., economic disadvantage, gender roles) can frustrate this identification; and that in school domains where these groups are negatively stereotyped, those who have become domain identified face the further barrier of stereotype threat, the threat that others' judgments or their own actions will negatively stereotype them in the domain. Research shows that this threat dramatically depresses the standardized test performance of women and African Americans who are in the academic vanguard of their groups (offering a new interpretation of group differences in standardized test performance), that it causes disidentification with school, and that practices that reduce this threat can reduce these negative effects.
27471513<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Transcription Factors and Plants Response to Drought Stress: Current Understanding and Future Directions.<<>>Increasing vulnerability of plants to a variety of stresses such as drought, salt and extreme temperatures poses a global threat to sustained growth and productivity of major crops. Of these stresses, drought represents a considerable threat to plant growth and development. In view of this, developing staple food cultivars with improved drought tolerance emerges as the most sustainable solution toward improving crop productivity in a scenario of climate change. In parallel, unraveling the genetic architecture and the targeted identification of molecular networks using modern "OMICS" analyses, that can underpin drought tolerance mechanisms, is urgently required. Importantly, integrated studies intending to elucidate complex mechanisms can bridge the gap existing in our current knowledge about drought stress tolerance in plants. It is now well established that drought tolerance is regulated by several genes, including transcription factors (TFs) that enable plants to withstand unfavorable conditions, and these remain potential genomic candidates for their wide application in crop breeding. These TFs represent the key molecular switches orchestrating the regulation of plant developmental processes in response to a variety of stresses. The current review aims to offer a deeper understanding of TFs engaged in regulating plant's response under drought stress and to devise potential strategies to improve plant tolerance against drought.
19573033<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Inhibitory control in anxious and healthy adolescents is modulated by incentive and incidental affective stimuli.<<>>BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are characterized by elevated, sustained responses to threat, that manifest as threat attention biases. Recent evidence also suggests exaggerated responses to incentives. How these characteristics influence cognitive control is under debate and is the focus of the present study. METHODS: Twenty-five healthy adolescents and 25 adolescents meeting DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder were compared on a task of response inhibition. Inhibitory control was assayed with an antisaccade task that included both incentive (monetary reward) and incidental emotion (facial expression) cues presented prior to the execution of inhibitory behavior. RESULTS: Inhibitory control was enhanced following exposure to threat cues (fear faces) only in adolescent patients, and following exposure to positive cues (happy faces) only in healthy adolescents. Results also revealed a robust performance improvement associated with monetary incentives. This incentive effect did not differ by group. No interaction between incentives and emotional cues was detected. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that biased processing of threat in anxious adolescents affects inhibitory control, perhaps by raising arousal prior to behavioral performance. The absence of normalization of performance in anxious adolescents following exposure to positive emotional cues is a novel finding and will require additional exploration. Future studies will need to more specifically examine how perturbations in positive emotion processes contribute to the symptomatology and the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders.
28955227<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Stress-Induced Reduction of Dorsal Striatal D2 Dopamine Receptors Prevents Retention of a Newly Acquired Adaptive Coping Strategy.<<>>The inability to learn an adaptive coping strategy in a novel stressful condition leads to dysfunctional stress coping, a marker of mental disturbances. This study tested the involvement of dorsal striatal dopamine receptors in the dysfunctional coping with the Forced Swim test fostered by a previous experience of reduced food availability. Adult male mice were submitted to a temporary (12 days) reduction of food availability [food-restricted (FR)] or continuously free-fed (FF). Different groups of FF and FR mice were used to evaluate: (1) dorsal striatal mRNA levels of the two isoforms of the dopamine D2 receptor (D2S, D2L). (2) Forced Swim-induced c-fos expression in the dorsal striatum; (3) acquisition and 24 h retention of passive coping with Forced Swim. Additional groups of FF mice were tested for 24 h retention of passive coping acquired during a first experience with Forced Swim immediately followed by intra-striatal infusion of vehicle or two doses of the dopamine D2/D3 receptors antagonist sulpiride or the D1/D5 receptors antagonist SCH23390. Previous restricted feeding selectively reduced mRNA levels of both D2 isoforms and abolished Forced Swim-induced c-fos expression in the left Dorsolateral Striatum and selectively prevented 24 h retention of the coping strategy acquired in a first experience of Forced Swim. Finally, temporary blockade of left Dorsolateral Striatum D2/D3 receptors immediately following the first Forced Swim experience selectively reproduced the behavioral effect of restricted feeding in FF mice. In conclusion, the present results demonstrate that mice previously exposed to a temporary reduction of food availability show low striatal D2 receptors, a known marker of addiction-associated aberrant neuroplasticity, as well as liability to relapse into maladaptive stress coping strategies. Moreover, they offer strong support to a causal relationship between reduction of D2 receptors in the left Dorsolateral Striatum and impaired consolidation of newly acquired adaptive coping.
23384512<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Enhanced discrimination between threatening and safe contexts in high-anxious individuals.<<>>Trait anxiety, a stable personality trait associated with increased fear responses to threat, is regarded as a risk factor for the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders. Although the effect of trait anxiety has been examined with regard to explicit threat cues, little is known about the effect of trait anxiety on contextual threat learning. To assess this issue, extreme groups of low and high trait anxiety underwent a contextual fear conditioning protocol using virtual reality. Two virtual office rooms served as the conditioned contexts. One virtual office room (CXT+) was paired with unpredictable electrical stimuli. In the other virtual office room, no electrical stimuli were delivered (CXT-). High-anxious participants tended to show faster acquisition of startle potentiation in the CXT+ versus the CXT- than low-anxious participants. This enhanced contextual fear learning might function as a risk factor for anxiety disorders that are characterized by sustained anxiety.
26852773<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Rabbit biocontrol and landscape-scale recovery of threatened desert mammals.<<>>Funding for species conservation is insufficient to meet the current challenges facing global biodiversity, yet many programs use expensive single-species recovery actions and neglect broader management that addresses threatening processes. Arid Australia has the world's worst modern mammalian extinction record, largely attributable to competition from introduced herbivores, particularly European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and predation by feral cats (Felis catus) and foxes (Vulpes vulpes). The biological control agent rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) was introduced to Australia in 1995 and resulted in dramatic, widespread rabbit suppression. We compared the area of occupancy and extent of occurrence of 4 extant species of small mammals before and after RHDV outbreak, relative to rainfall, sampling effort, and rabbit and predator populations. Despite low rainfall during the first 14 years after RHDV, 2 native rodents listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the dusky hopping-mouse (Notomys fuscus) and plains mouse (Pseudomys australis), increased their extent of occurrence by 241-365%. A threatened marsupial micropredator, the crest-tailed mulgara (Dasycercus cristicauda), underwent a 70-fold increase in extent of occurrence and a 20-fold increase in area of occupancy. Both bottom-up and top-down trophic effects were attributed to RHDV, namely decreased competition for food resources and declines in rabbit-dependent predators. Based on these sustained increases, these 3 previously threatened species now qualify for threat-category downgrading on the IUCN Red List. These recoveries are on a scale rarely documented in mammals and give impetus to programs aimed at targeted use of RHDV in Australia, rather than simply employing top-down threat-based management of arid ecosystems. Conservation programs that take big-picture approaches to addressing threatening processes over large spatial scales should be prioritized to maximize return from scarce conservation funding. Further, these should be coupled with long-term ecological monitoring, a critical tool in detecting and understanding complex ecosystem change.
30753786<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Investigational drug therapies currently in early-stage clinical development for the treatment of clostridioides (clostridium) difficile infection.<<>>INTRODUCTION: Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile Infection (CDI) is an urgent global threat causing ~500,000 infections annually in the United States of America (USA) and is associated with a 36% 30-day attributable mortality rate. Despite the availability of three therapeutic agents, CDI recurrence occurs in 20-40% of patients, with a 30-40% second recurrence rate in these patients. Consequently, there is a need for novel agents for treating CDI. Areas covered: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov for agents in early stages of clinical development. These drugs include ACX-362E, DS-2969b, LFF 571, RBX2660, ribaxamase, ridinilazole that have advanced to at least phase 2 and several other drugs in phase 1 development. Expert opinion: The challenge for these new agents is three-fold: (1) to have a novel approach such as a different target/mechanism of action; (2) be 'significantly' better than existing agents in regard to 'sustained clinical response'; or (3) be priced at a reasonable cost when it comes to market or perhaps all three. Their utility can only be proven by clinical trials.
23922992<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Changes in bleaching susceptibility among corals subject to ocean warming and recurrent bleaching in Moorea, French Polynesia.<<>>BACKGROUND: Climate-induced coral bleaching poses a major threat to coral reef ecosystems, mostly because of the sensitivities of key habitat-forming corals to increasing temperature. However, susceptibility to bleaching varies greatly among coral genera and there are likely to be major changes in the relative abundance of different corals, even if the wholesale loss of corals does not occur for several decades. Here we document variation in bleaching susceptibility among key genera of reef-building corals in Moorea, French Polynesia, and compare bleaching incidence during mass-bleaching events documented in 1991, 1994, 2002 and 2007. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This study compared the proportion of colonies that bleached for four major genera of reef-building corals (Acropora, Montipora, Pocillopora and Porites), during each of four well-documented bleaching events from 1991 to 2007. Acropora and Montipora consistently bleached in far greater proportions (up to 98%) than Pocillopora and Porites. However, there was an apparent and sustained decline in the proportion of colonies that bleached during successive bleaching events, especially for Acropora and Montipora. In 2007, only 77% of Acropora colonies bleached compared with 98% in 1991. Temporal variation in the proportion of coral colonies bleached may be attributable to differences in environmental conditions among years. Alternately, the sustained declines in bleaching incidence among highly susceptible corals may be indicative of acclimation or adaptation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Coral genera that are highly susceptible to coral bleaching, and especially Acropora and Montipora, exhibit temporal declines in their susceptibility to thermal anomalies at Moorea, French Polynesia. One possible explanation for these findings is that gradual removal of highly susceptible genotypes (through selective mortality of individuals, populations, and/or species) is producing a coral assemblage that is more resistant to sustained and ongoing ocean warming.
28163109<<>>Sustained_Threat<<>>Strategies for serum chemokine/cytokine assessment as biomarkers of therapeutic response in HCV patients as a prototype to monitor immunotherapy of infectious diseases.<<>>In this study, strategies for serum biomarker assessment were developed for therapeutic monitoring of HCV patients. For this purpose, serum chemokine/cytokine levels were measured by cytometric-bead-array in HCV patients, categorized according to immunotherapy response as: non-responder/NR, relapser/REL and sustained-virologic-responder/SVR. The results demonstrated an overall increase of serum chemokine/cytokine levels in HCV patients. In general, therapeutic failure was associated with presence of a predominant baseline proinflammatory pattern with enhanced CCL5/RANTES, IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma along with decreased IL-10 levels in NR and increased IL-6 and TNF in REL. SVR displayed lower baseline proinflammatory status with decreased CXCL8/IL-8, IL-12 and IL-17 levels. The inability to uphold IFN-alpha levels during immunotherapy was characteristic of NR. Serum chemokine/cytokine signatures further support the deleterious effect of proinflammatory baseline status and the critical role of increased/persistent IFN-alpha levels to guarantee the sustained virologic response. The prominent baseline proinflammatory milieu observed in NR and REL yielded a restricted biomarker network with small number of neighborhood connections, whereas SVR displayed a network with integrated cytokine connectivity. Noteworthy was that SVR presented a shift towards a proinflammatory pattern upon immunotherapy, assuming a pattern similar to that observed in NR and REL at baseline. Moreover, the immunotherapy guided REL towards a profile similar to SVR at baseline. Analysis of baseline-fold changes during treatment pointed out IFN-alpha and TNF as high-performance biomarkers to monitor immunotherapy outcome. This knowledge may contribute for novel insights into the treatment and control of the continuous public health threat posed by HCV infection worldwide.
