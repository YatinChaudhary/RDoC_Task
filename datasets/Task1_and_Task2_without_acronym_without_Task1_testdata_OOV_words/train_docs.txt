Acute_Threat_Fear	trauma exposure acutely alters neural function during pavlovian fear conditioning posttraumatic stress disorder is associated with dysfunction of the neural circuitry that supports fear learning and memory processes however much of what is known about neural dysfunction in is based on research in chronic populations less is known about neural function that supports fear learning acutely following trauma exposure determining the acute effects of trauma exposure on brain function would provide new insight into the neural processes that mediate the cognitive affective dysfunction associated with therefore the present study investigated neural activity that supports fear learning and memory processes in recently trauma exposed and non trauma exposed participants participants completed a pavlovian fear conditioning procedure during functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri during fmri participants threat expectancy was continuously monitored participants showed greater threat expectancy during warning than safety cues while no difference was observed in the group this finding suggests participants overgeneralized the fear association to the safety cue further only the group showed a negative relationship between fmri signal responses within dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and threat expectancy during safety cues these results suggest the dorsomedial mediates overgeneralization of learned fear as an acute result of trauma exposure finally neural activity within the and inferior parietal lobule showed a negative relationship with symptom severity assessed three months posttrauma thus neural activity measured acutely following trauma exposure predicted future symptom severity the present findings elucidate the acute effects of trauma exposure on cognitive affective function and provide new insight into the neural mechanisms of
Acute_Threat_Fear	dissociation of within and between session extinction of conditioned fear recent findings obtained in patients with phobias or trauma related anxiety disorders raise doubts concerning the interrelation between acute fear relief during an exposure based therapeutic session and beneficial treatment progress in a mouse model explicit for exposure therapy we challenge the view that within session fear reduction is the turning point for relearning of a stimulus threat association even though within session extinction of auditory cued fear memory was identical for prolonged and spaced tone presentations only the latter caused between session extinction furthermore spaced tone presentations led to between session extinction even in the complete absence of within session extinction as observed for remote fear memories and in case of abolished cannabinoid receptor type num signaling induction of between session extinction was accompanied by an increase in the number of c fos positive neurons within the basolateral amygdala the cingulate cortex and the dentate gyrus independent of the level of within session extinction together our findings demonstrate that within session extinction is neither sufficient nor essential for between session extinction thus calling for a reconsideration of current concepts underlying exposure based therapies
Acute_Threat_Fear	anticipatory prefrontal cortex activity underlies stress induced changes in pavlovian fear conditioning excessive stress exposure often leads to emotional dysfunction characterized by disruptions in healthy emotional learning expression and regulation processes prefrontal cortex amygdala circuit appears to underlie these important emotional processes however limited human neuroimaging research has investigated whether these brain regions underlie the altered emotional function that develops with stress therefore the present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri to investigate stress induced changes in amygdala function during pavlovian fear conditioning participants completed a variant of the montreal imaging stress task followed min later by a pavlovian fear conditioning task during fmri self reported stress to the was used to identify three stress reactivity groups low medium and high psychophysiological behavioral and fmri signal responses were compared between the three stress reactivity groups during fear conditioning fear learning indexed via participant expectation of the unconditioned stimulus during conditioning increased with stress reactivity further the high stress reactivity group demonstrated greater autonomic arousal i e skin conductance response to both conditioned and unconditioned stimuli compared to the low and medium stress reactivity groups finally the high stress group did not regulate the emotional response to threat more specifically the high stress reactivity group did not show a negative relationship between conditioned and unconditioned scrs stress induced changes in these emotional processes paralleled changes in dorsolateral dorsomedial and ventromedial function these findings demonstrate that acute stress facilitates fear learning enhances autonomic arousal and impairs emotion regulation and suggests these stress induced changes in emotional function are mediated by the
Acute_Threat_Fear	global and situational relationship satisfaction moderate the effect of threat on pain in couples the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that greater global and situational relationship satisfaction would reduce the negative impact of threatening information on acute pain an experimental design was used to manipulate threat and elicit acute pain via a cold pressor task the study was completed in a research laboratory at a large urban university in the midwestern participants were num couples in which at least one individual was an undergraduate student after administration of a global relationship satisfaction measure couples were randomly assigned to either receive high or low threatening information about the painful task following the threat manipulation couples discussed the upcoming task and rated their satisfaction with the interaction i e situational relationship satisfaction the designated pain participant then completed the painful task alone the threat manipulation altered couples perceived threat of pain situational relationship satisfaction moderated the effect of threat on pain trajectories such that situational relationship satisfaction predicted less pain intensity at an earlier point in the task for the low threat condition than the high threat condition greater global relationship satisfaction predicted greater likelihood of task completion among those in the low threat condition whereas it was unrelated to task completion in the high threat condition greater global relationship satisfaction also predicted lower pain intensity throughout the task these findings demonstrate that the interpersonal context is independently related to acute pain and may also alter the effect of threatening information on acute pain
Acute_Threat_Fear	effects of testosterone administration on threat and escape anticipation in the orbitofrontal cortex recent evidence suggests that the steroid hormone testosterone can decrease the functional coupling between orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala theoretically this decoupling has been linked to a testosterone driven increase of goal directed behaviour in case of threat but this has never been studied directly therefore we placed twenty two women in dynamically changing situations of escapable and inescapable threat after a within subject placebo controlled testosterone administration using functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri we provide evidence that testosterone activates the left lateral in preparation of active goal directed escape and decouples this area from a subcortical threat system including the central medial amygdala hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray this decoupling was specific to threatening situations a point that was further emphasized by an absence of such decoupling in a second experiment focused on resting state connectivity these results not only confirm that testosterone administration decouples the from the subcortical threat system but also show that this is specifically the case in response to acute threat and ultimately leads to an increase in activity when the participant prepares a goal directed action to escape together these results for the first time provide a detailed understanding of functional brain alterations induced by testosterone under threat conditions and corroborate and extend the view that testosterone prepares the brain for goal directed action in case of threat

Acute_Threat_Fear	social fearfulness in the human brain social fearfulness is expressed on a continuum of severity from moderate distress to incapacitating fear the present article focuses on the brain states associated with this broad dimension of social anxiety in humans in total num published studies are summarized documenting the neural correlates of social anxiety during states of rest threat related cognitive affective activation and acute symptom provocation neural exaggeration in limbic amygdala and paralimbic insula regions appears to be associated with functional outcomes involving increased attention for and processing of social threat evidence is also reviewed showing that social anxiety is characterized by atypical functional connectivity in certain brain networks despite a higher prevalence of social anxiety disorder among females males have been overrepresented in the published clinical studies constituting approximately num of the total participants we evaluate the prospects of nonhuman animal models of social anxiety and discuss several promising directions for future research the review highlights the need to adopt an integrative network based approach to the study of the neural substrates underlying social anxiety
Acute_Threat_Fear	fear reduction in patients with chronic pain a learning theory perspective acute pain informs the individual that there is an imminent threat of body damage and is associated with the urge to escape and avoid fear learning takes place when neutral stimuli receive the propensity to predict the occurrence of pain and when defensive responses are initiated in anticipation of potential threats to the integrity of the body fear avoidance models have been put forward featuring the role of individual differences in catastrophic interpretations of pain in the modulation of learning and avoidance based on extensive literature on fear reduction in anxiety disorders cognitive behavioral treatments have been developed and applied to patients with chronic pain reporting substantial pain related fear in this article we discuss mechanisms underlying the acquisition the assessment and extinction of pain related fear through the cognitive behavioral treatment of pain related fear finally we provide a number of critical notes and directions for future research in the field of chronic pain and pain related fear
Acute_Threat_Fear	affective and neuroendocrine effects of withdrawal from chronic long acting opiate administration although the long acting opiate methadone is commonly used to treat drug addiction relatively little is known about the effects of withdrawal from this drug in preclinical models the current study examined affective neuroendocrine and somatic signs of withdrawal from the longer acting methadone derivative l alpha acetylmethydol in rats anxiety like behavior during both spontaneous and antagonist precipitated withdrawal was measured by potentiation of the startle reflex withdrawal elevated corticosterone and somatic signs and blunted circadian variations in baseline startle responding in addition fear to an explicit pavlovian conditioned stimulus fear potentiated startle was enhanced these data suggest that anxiety like behavior as measured using potentiated startle responding does not emerge spontaneously during withdrawal from chronic opiate exposure in contrast to withdrawal from acute drug exposure but rather is manifested as exaggerated fear in response to explicit threat cues
Acute_Threat_Fear	how human amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis may drive distinct defensive responses the ability to adaptively regulate responses to the proximity of potential danger is critical to survival and imbalance in this system may contribute to psychopathology the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis is implicated in defensive responding during uncertain threat anticipation whereas the amygdala may drive responding upon more acute danger this functional dissociation between the and amygdala is however controversial and human evidence scarce here we used data from two independent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies n num males and n num num females to probe how coordination between the and amygdala may regulate responses during shock anticipation and actual shock confrontation in a subset of participants from sample num n num we demonstrate that anticipation and confrontation evoke bradycardic and tachycardic responses respectively further we show that in each sample when going from shock anticipation to the moment of shock confrontation neural activity shifted from a region anatomically consistent with the toward the amygdala comparisons of functional connectivity during threat processing showed overlapping yet also consistently divergent functional connectivity profiles for the and amygdala finally childhood maltreatment levels predicted amygdala but not hyperactivity during shock anticipation our results support an evolutionary conserved defensive distance dependent dynamic balance between and amygdala activity shifts in this balance may enable shifts in defensive reactions via the demonstrated differential functional connectivity our results indicate that early life stress may tip the neural balance toward acute threat responding and via that route predispose for affective disorder previously proposed differential contributions of the and amygdala to fear and anxiety have been recently debated despite the significance of understanding their contributions to defensive reactions there is a paucity of human studies that directly compared these regions on activity and connectivity during threat processing we show strong evidence for a dissociable role of the and amygdala in threat processing by demonstrating in two large participant samples that they show a distinct temporal signature of threat responding as well as a discriminable pattern of functional connections and differential sensitivity to early life threat
Acute_Threat_Fear	fear load the psychophysiological over expression of fear as an intermediate phenotype associated with trauma reactions psychophysiological measures of fear expression provide observable intermediate phenotypes of fear related symptoms research domain criteria rdoc advocate using neurobiological intermediate phenotypes that provide dimensional correlates of psychopathology negative valence systems in the rdoc matrix include the construct of acute threat which can be measured on a physiological level using potentiation of the acoustic startle reflex assessed via electromyography recordings of the orbicularis oculi muscle impairments in extinction of fear potentiated startle due to high levels of fear termed fear load during the early phases of extinction have been observed in posttraumatic stress disorder the goals of the current work were to examine dimensional associations between fear related symptoms of and fear load variables to test their validity as an intermediate phenotype we examined extinction of fear potentiated startle in a cohort n num of individuals with a broad range of civilian trauma exposure range num num traumatic events per person mean num num based on previously reported findings we hypothesized that fear load would be significantly associated with intrusion and fear memories of an index traumatic event the results indicated that early extinction was correlated with intrusive thoughts p num num and intense physiological reactions to trauma reminders p num num degree of adult or childhood trauma exposure and depression severity were not associated with fear load after controlling for age sex race income level of prior trauma and level of fear conditioning fear load during extinction was still significantly predictive of intrusive thoughts p num num the significance of these findings is that they support dimensional associations with symptom severity rather than diagnostic category and as such fear load may emerge as a transdiagnostic intermediate phenotype expressed across fear related disorders e g specific phobia social phobia
Acute_Threat_Fear	attention bias towards negative emotional information and its relationship with daily worry in the context of acute stress an eye tracking study cognitive theories of anxiety psychopathology cite biased attention towards threat as a central vulnerability and maintaining factor however many studies have found threat bias indices to have poor reliability and have failed to observe the theorized relationship between threat bias and anxiety symptoms this may be due to the non unitary nature of threat bias and the influence of state level variables on its expression accumulating data suggests that state anxious mood is important for the robust expression of threat bias and for relations to emerge between threat bias and symptoms though this possibility has not been experimentally tested eye tracking was used to assess multiple forms of threat bias i e early vigilance sustained attention facilitated engagement delayed disengagement thought to be related to anxiety non clinical sample num was recruited to test the hypothesis that biased attention towards threat but not dysphoric or positive emotional stimuli during an anxious mood induction but not at a pre stress baseline would prospectively predict greater worry symptoms on days in which more naturalistic stressors occurred results revealed the hypothesized moderation effect for sustained attention towards threat after the mood induction but not at baseline though sustained attention towards dysphoric stimuli also moderated the effect of stressors on worry worry relevant sustained attention towards negative emotional stimuli may be a partially mood context dependent phenomenon
Acute_Threat_Fear	single dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram exacerbates anxiety in humans a fear potentiated startle study serotonin reuptake inhibitors may increase symptoms of anxiety immediately following treatment initiation the present study examined whether acute citalopram increased fear potentiated startle to predictable and or unpredictable shocks in healthy subjects eighteen healthy subjects each received two treatments placebo and num mg citalopram in a crossover design participants were exposed to three conditions including one in which predictable aversive shocks were signaled by a cue a second in which unpredictable shocks were anticipated and a third in which no shocks were administered changes in aversive states were investigated using acoustic startle stimuli citalopram did not affect baseline startle however the phasic startle potentiation to the threat cue in the predictable condition was robustly increased by acute citalopram the sustained startle potentiation in the unpredictable conditions was also increased by citalopram but only when the drug was given during the first session these results indicate that a single dose of citalopram is not anxiogenic in itself but can exacerbate the expression of fear and anxiety
Acute_Threat_Fear	sensitivity of late latency auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials to threat of electric shock and the sedative drugs diazepam and diphenhydramine in human volunteers late latency auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials are sensitive to some centrally acting drugs and to certain psychological interventions in this experiment we compared the effects of acute doses of a benzodiazepine diazepam and an num histamine receptor blocking sedative diphenhydramine on auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials within the latency range num num ms in a fear conditioning paradigm twelve healthy males num num years participated in three sessions at weekly intervals in which they received diazepam mg diphenhydramine num mg and placebo in a balanced double blind crossover protocol one hundred and twenty min after diphenhydramine or num min after diazepam they underwent an num min recording period in which auditory evoked potentials elicited by num ms num db num khz tones and somatosensory evoked potentials elicited by a mildly painful electric shock num num ma num ms were recorded at cz vertex each session consisted of four blocks of trials in which either the sound pulse or the shock was presented alternate blocks were designated or context conditions in blocks subjects were warned that shocks would be delivered via electrodes placed on the wrist electrodes were removed during blocks in one and one block the sound stimuli and shocks shocks were delivered only in the block were preceded by a num s conditioned stimulus a red light cue condition diazepam but not diphenhydramine reduced the amplitude of the auditory evoked potential the context was associated with increased and reduced potential amplitudes the had no effect on the amplitudes but markedly reduced the latencies of the and potentials under the condition diazepam reduced the amplitudes of the somatosensory potential evoked by the shock the shortened the latencies of the later components of the response diazepam and diphenhydramine were approximately equi sedative in the doses used in this experiment as judged by visual analogue self rating scales the results indicate that the suppression of late latency auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials by diazepam is not simply a reflection of sedation late latency evoked potentials can be modified by an aversive but the components that are sensitive to the are different from those that are sensitive to diazepam
Acute_Threat_Fear	amygdala reactivity is inversely related to level of cannabis use in individuals with comorbid cannabis dependence and major depression phan et al num recently reported that an acute dose of oral is associated with a decrease in threat related amygdala reactivity during a social threat stimulus task however to date those findings have not been replicated and have not been extended to clinical studies involving smoked rather than oral cannabis in this study we hypothesized that level of cannabis smoked by participants in our treatment study would be inversely related to the level of threat related amygdala reactivity subjects were recruited from among participants in our double blind placebo controlled trial of fluoxetine in comorbid youth with cannabis dependence major depression the threat related amygdala reactivity task used by hariri et al num was completed during fmri scans at study baseline and then again num weeks later at the end of the trial data are available from six subjects with pre and post treatment fmri data during the course of the study five of the six subjects demonstrated a decrease in their level of cannabis use with a mean decrease of num and those persons all demonstrated an increase in their level of amygdala reactivity one subject demonstrated an increase in their level of cannabis use a num increase during the treatment trial and that person demonstrated a decrease in their level of amygdala reactivity thus a higher level of cannabis use was consistently associated with a lower level of amygdala reactivity across all subjects matched pairs t num num df num p num num two tailed these findings are consistent with the reports by phan et al num and hariri et al num suggesting that cannabinoids have an inhibitory effect on threat related amygdala reactivity
Acute_Threat_Fear	individual differences in threat sensitivity predict serotonergic modulation of amygdala response to fearful faces in this study we used functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri to examine the effects of acute tryptophan depletion a well recognised method for inducing transient cerebral serotonin depletion on brain activation to fearful faces we predicted that would increase the responsiveness of the amygdala to fearful faces as a function of individual variation in threat sensitivity twelve healthy male volunteers received a tryptophan depleting drink or a tryptophan balancing amino acid drink placebo in a double blind crossover design five hours after drink ingestion participants were scanned whilst viewing fearful happy and neutral faces consistent with previous findings fearful faces induced significant signal change in the bilateral amygdala hippocampus as well as the fusiform face area and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex furthermore modulated amygdala hippocampus activation in response to fearful relative to happy faces as a function of self reported threat sensitivity as measured with the behavioral inhibition scale carver white num behavioral inhibition behavioral activation and affective responses to impending reward and punishment the scales pers soc psychol num num num the data support the hypothesis that individual variation in threat sensitivity interacts with manipulation of num function to bias the processing of amygdala dependent threat relevant stimuli
Acute_Threat_Fear	genetic influences on the neural and physiological bases of acute threat research domain criteria rdoc perspective the research domain criteria rdoc initiative aims to describe key dimensional constructs underlying mental function across multiple units of analysis from genes to observable behaviors in order to better understand psychopathology the acute threat fear construct of the rdoc negative valence system has been studied extensively from a translational perspective and is highly pertinent to numerous psychiatric conditions including anxiety and trauma related disorders we examined genetic contributions to the construct of acute threat at two units of analysis within the rdoc framework num neural circuits and num physiology specifically we focused on genetic influences on activation patterns of frontolimbic neural circuitry and on startle skin conductance and heart rate responses research on the heritability of activation in threat related frontolimbic neural circuitry is lacking but physiological indicators of acute threat have been found to be moderately heritable num num genetic studies of the neural circuitry and physiology of acute threat have almost exclusively relied on the candidate gene method and as in the broader psychiatric genetics literature most findings have failed to replicate the most robust support has been demonstrated for associations between variation in the serotonin transporter and catechol methyltransferase genes with threat related neural activation and physiological responses however unbiased genome wide approaches using very large samples are needed for gene discovery and these can be accomplished with collaborative consortium based research efforts such as those of the psychiatric genomics consortium and enhancing neuro imaging genetics through meta analysis consortium
Acute_Threat_Fear	stress promotes generalization of older but not recent threat memories stress broadly affects the ability to regulate emotions and may contribute to generalization of threat related behaviors to harmless stimuli behavioral generalization also tends to increase over time as memory precision for recent events gives way to more gist like representations thus acute stress coupled with a delay in time from a negative experience may be a strong predictor of the transition from normal to generalized fear expression here we investigated the effect of a single episode acute stressor on generalization of aversive learning when stress is administered either immediately after an aversive learning event or following a delay in a between subjects design healthy adult volunteers underwent threat fear conditioning using a tone conditioned stimulus paired with an electric shock to the wrist and another tone not paired with shock behavioral generalization was tested to a range of novel tones either on the same day experiment num or num h later experiment num and was preceded by either an acute stress induction or a control task anticipatory sympathetic arousal i e skin conductance responses scrs and explicit measures of shock expectancy served as dependent measures stress administered shortly after threat conditioning did not affect behavioral generalization in contrast stress administered following a delay led to heightened arousal and increased generalization of scrs and explicit measures of shock expectancy these findings show that acute stress increases generalization of older but not recent threat memories and have clinical relevance to understanding overgeneralization characteristics of anxiety and stress related disorders
Acute_Threat_Fear	peril and pleasure an rdoc inspired examination of threat responses and reward processing in anxiety and depression as a step toward addressing limitations in the current psychiatric diagnostic system the national institute of mental health recently developed the research domain criteria rdoc to stimulate integrative research spanning self report behavior neural circuitry and molecular genetic mechanisms on core psychological processes implicated in mental illness here we use the rdoc conceptualization to review research on threat responses reward processing and their interaction the first section of the manuscript highlights the pivotal role of exaggerated threat responses mediated by circuits connecting the frontal cortex amygdala and midbrain in anxiety and reviews data indicating that genotypic variation in the serotonin system is associated with hyperactivity in this circuitry which elevates the risk for anxiety and mood disorders in the second section we describe mounting evidence linking anhedonic behavior to deficits in psychological functions that rely heavily on dopamine signaling especially cost benefit decision making and reward learning the third section covers recent studies that document negative effects of acute threats and chronic stress on reward responses in humans the mechanisms underlying such effects are unclear but the fourth section reviews new optogenetic data in rodents indicating that gabaergic inhibition of midbrain dopamine neurons driven by activation of the habenula may play a fundamental role in stress induced anhedonia in addition to its basic scientific value a better understanding of interactions between the neural systems that mediate threat and reward responses may offer relief from the burdensome condition of anxious depression
Acute_Threat_Fear	life threatening danger and suppression of attention bias to threat life threatening danger is assumed to produce in tandem increases in both vigilance toward threat and stress related symptoms but no data test the validity of this assumption the authors examined associations in real time among imminent life threatening danger stress related symptoms and vigilance symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder depression and anxiety were measured in a civilian population num as a function of war related stress operationalized as the time available for seeking cover from rocket attack computerized measure of threat related vigilance using a classic dot probe attention task was also collected symptoms depression and anxiety increased as a function of war related threat acute proximal threat was associated with avoidance of rather than vigilance toward negative valence information for participants within rocket range the magnitude of threat bias varied with the magnitude of distress symptoms such that as bias away from threat increased distress symptoms increased these data challenge current thinking about the role of attention in stress responding attentional threat avoidance may reduce the acute impact of imminent threat but this may come at a price in terms of an elevated risk for psychopathology

Acute_Threat_Fear	social threat learning transfers to decision making in humans in today s world mass media and online social networks present us with unprecedented exposure to second hand vicarious experiences and thereby the chance of forming associations between previously innocuous events e g being in a subway station and aversive outcomes e g footage or verbal reports from a violent terrorist attack without direct experience such social threat or fear learning can have dramatic consequences as manifested in acute stress symptoms and maladaptive fears however most research has so far focused on socially acquired threat responses that are expressed as increased arousal rather than active behavior in three experiments n num we examined the effect of indirect experiences on behaviors by establishing a link between social threat learning and instrumental decision making we contrasted learning from direct experience i e pavlovian conditioning experiment num against two common forms of social threat learning social observation experiment num and verbal instruction experiment num and how this learning transferred to subsequent instrumental decision making using behavioral experiments and computational modeling we found that both types of social threat learning transfer to decision making in a strong and surprisingly inflexible manner notably computational modeling indicated that the transfer of observational and instructed threat learning involved different computational mechanisms our results demonstrate the strong influence of others expressions of fear on one s own decisions and have important implications for understanding both healthy and pathological human behaviors resulting from the indirect exposure to threatening events
Acute_Threat_Fear	oxytocin attenuates amygdala reactivity to fear in generalized social anxiety disorder patients with generalized social anxiety disorder exhibit heightened activation of the amygdala in response to social cues conveying threat eg fearful angry faces the neuropeptide oxytocin decreases anxiety and stress facilitates social encounters and attenuates amygdala reactivity to threatening faces in healthy subjects the goal of this study was to examine the effects of on fear related amygdala reactivity in and matched healthy control subjects in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study utilizing a double blind placebo controlled within subjects design we measured amygdala activation to an emotional face matching task of fearful angry and happy faces following acute intranasal administration of num or num num mug and placebo in num and num subjects both the and groups activated bilateral amygdala to all emotional faces during placebo with the group exhibiting hyperactivity specifically to fearful faces in bilateral amygdala compared with the group had no effect on amygdala activity to emotional faces in the group but attenuated the heightened amygdala reactivity to fearful faces in the group such that the hyperactivity observed during the placebo session was no longer evident following ie normalization these findings suggest that has a specific effect on fear related amygdala activity particularly when the amygdala is hyperactive such as in thereby providing a brain based mechanism of the impact of in modulating the exaggerated processing of social signals of threat in patients with pathological anxiety

Acute_Threat_Fear	prior stress promotes the generalization of contextual fear memories involvement of the gabaergic signaling within the basolateral amygdala complex fear generalization occurs when a response previously acquired with a threatening stimulus is transferred to a similar one however it could be maladaptive when stimuli that do not represent a real threat are appraised as dangerous which is a hallmark of several anxiety disorders stress exposure is a major risk factor for the occurrence of anxiety disorders and it is well established that it influences different phases of fear memory nevertheless its impact on the generalization of contextual fear memories has been less studied in the present work we have characterized the impact of acute restraint stress prior to contextual fear conditioning on the generalization of this fear memory and the role of the gabaergic signaling within the basolateral amygdala complex on the stress modulatory effects we have found that a single stress exposure promoted the generalization of this memory trace to a different context that was well discriminated in unstressed conditioned animals moreover this effect was dependent on the formation of a contextual associative memory and on the testing order i e conditioning context first vs generalization context first furthermore we observed that increasing signaling by intra midazolam administration prior to the stressful session exposure prevented the generalization of fear memory whereas intra administration of the antagonist bicuculline prior to fear conditioning induced the generalization of fear memory in unstressed rats we concluded that stress exposure prior to contextual fear conditioning promotes the generalization of fear memory and that the gabaergic transmission within the has a critical role in this phenomenon
Acute_Threat_Fear	enhanced stress responses in adolescent versus adult rats exposed to cues of predation threat and peer interaction as a predictor of adult defensiveness development of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis is influenced by external factors during early life in mammals which optimizes adult function for predicted conditions we have hypothesized that adolescence represents a sensitive period for the development of some aspects of adult stress response regulation this was based on prior work showing that repeated exposure of rats to a stressor across an adolescent period increases fearfulness in a novel environment in adulthood and results in lower levels of dopamine receptor subtype num protein in prefrontal cortex here we further our investigation of both acute and long term effects of repeated adolescent stressor exposure on physiological i e corticosterone and behavioral i e defensive behavior measures of stress responding in male and female rats furthermore we compared outcomes with those following identical manipulations administered in early adulthood and found that animals exposed to cues of predation threat during adolescence showed the most robust defensive responses to a homotypic stressor encountered in adulthood peer interaction during control manipulation in adolescence was identified as an important individual characteristic mediating development of adult defensive strategies
Acute_Threat_Fear	mother lowers glucocorticoid levels of preweaning rats after acute threat exposure to a deadly threat an adult male rat induced the release of corticosterone in num day old rat pups the endocrine stress response was decreased when the pups were reunited with their mother immediately after exposure these findings demonstrate that social variables can reduce the consequences of an aversive experience
Acute_Threat_Fear	overt behavior and ultrasonic vocalization in a fear conditioning paradigm a dose response study in the rat the behavioral analysis of laboratory rats is usually confined to the level of overt behavior like locomotion behavioral inhibition instrumental responses and others apart from such visible outcome however behaviorally relevant information can also be obtained when analyzing the animals ultrasonic vocalization which is typically emitted in highly motivational situations like num khz calls in response to acute or conditioned threat to further investigate such vocalizations and their relationship with overt behavior we tested male wistar rats in a paradigm of pavlovian fear conditioning where a tone stimulus was preceding an aversive foot shock in a distinct environment importantly the shock dose was varied between groups num num num ma and its acute and conditioned outcome were determined the analysis of visible behavior confirms the usefulness of immobility as a measure of fear conditioning especially when higher shock doses were used rearing and grooming on the other hand were more useful to detect conditioned effects with lower shock levels ultrasonic vocalization occurred less consistently than changes in overt behavior however dose response relationships were also observed during the phase of conditioning for example in latency call rate and lengths intervals between calls and sound amplitude furthermore total calling time and rate were highly correlated with overt behavior namely behavioral inhibition as measured through immobility these correlations were observed during the phase of fear conditioning and the subsequent tests importantly conditioned effects in overt behavior were observed both to the context and to the presented in this context whereas conditioned vocalization to the context was not observed except for one rat in support and extent of previous results the present data show that a detailed analysis of ultrasonic vocalization can substantially broaden and refine the spectrum of analysis in behavioral work with rats since it can provide information about situational state and subject dependent factors which are partly distinct from what is visible to the experimenter
Acute_Threat_Fear	single administration of cortisol acutely reduces preconscious attention for fear in anxious young men chronically elevated activity has often been associated with fear and anxiety but there is evidence that single administrations of glucocorticoids may acutely reduce fear moreover peri traumatic cortisol elevation may protect against development of post traumatic stress disorder hypervigilant processing of threat information plays a role in anxiety disorders and although relations with functioning have been established causality of these relations remains unclear presently self reported anxiety and response time patterns on a masked emotional stroop task with fearful faces were measured in num healthy young men after double blind placebo controlled oral administration of num mg cortisol the masked fearful stroop task measures vocal colornaming response latencies for pictures of neutral and fearful faces presented below the threshold for conscious perception results showed increased response times on trials for fearful compared to neutral faces after placebo but this emotional stroop effect was acutely abolished by cortisol administration this effect was most pronounced in subjects with heightened anxiety levels this is the first evidence showing that exogenous cortisol acutely reduces anxiety driven selective attention to threat these results extend earlier findings of acute fear reduction after glucocorticoid administration this suggests interactions of functioning and vigilant attention in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders possible neuroendocrine mechanisms of action are discussed
Acute_Threat_Fear	can hospital form trigger fear response to examine whether exposure to curve versus sharp contours in the built healthcare setting produces systematic and identifiable patterns of amygdala activation and behavioral response in healthy adults recent studies in cognitive neuroscience suggest that humans prefer objects with a curved contour compared with objects that have pointed features and a sharp angled contour an implicit perception of threat represented by sharp objects in humans was hypothesized to explain this bias the study adopted a within subject experimental design where num subjects representing three age groups and both sexes were exposed to a randomized order of num real life images objects interiors exteriors landscape and a set of control images amygdala activation was simultaneously captured using functional magnetic resonance imaging technology subjects preference like dislike data were also collected while in the scanner data were collected in num in case of images depicting landscape and healthcare objects brain scans show significant higher amygdala activation associated with sharp contours however in relation to images depicting hospital interiors and exterior envelops brain scans show significant higher amygdala activation associated with curve contours these activations pertain to exposure during the precognitive stages of the subjects perception hospital forms do have systematic impact on fear response during precognitive stages of human perception whether this first impression colors the subsequent experience of an actual patient with real illness or injury is unknown
Acute_Threat_Fear	cortisol administration acutely reduces threat selective spatial attention in healthy young men there is mounting evidence that single administrations of glucocorticoids may acutely reduce human fear we previously reported that administration of cortisol acutely reduced non spatial selective attention to fearful faces and likewise reduced preferential processing of fearful faces in a spatial working memory task here we report the acute effects of num mg cortisol administered in a double blind placebo controlled crossover design on a different experimental task for measuring threat selective attention twenty healthy young males had to localize a target which was presented in a peripheral location that was either gazed at or not by a preceding dynamic happy or fearful face this reliable method has been used repeatedly to demonstrate fear driven selective attention present results showed that after placebo as usual the fearful gaze cues caused stronger orienting of attention than happy faces cortisol abolished this typical anxious response pattern but only in low anxious participants these data provide evidence that cortisol acutely influences also spatial threat selective attention possible neuroendocrine mechanisms are discussed
Arousal	cultural differences in emotion differences in emotional arousal level between the east and the west whether emotion is universal or social is a recurrent issue in the history of emotion study among psychologists some researchers view emotion as a universal construct and that a large part of emotional experience is biologically based however emotion is not only biologically determined but is also influenced by the environment therefore cultural differences exist in some aspects of emotions one such important aspect of emotion being emotional arousal level all affective states are systematically represented as two bipolar dimensions valence and arousal arousal level of actual and ideal emotions has consistently been found to have cross cultural differences in western or individualist culture high arousal emotions are valued and promoted more than low arousal emotions moreover westerners experience high arousal emotions more than low arousal emotions by contrast in eastern or collectivist culture low arousal emotions are valued more than high arousal emotions moreover people in the east actually experience and prefer to experience low arousal emotions more than high arousal emotions mechanism of these cross cultural differences and implications are also discussed
Arousal	pupil size changes as an active information channel for biofeedback applications pupil size is usually regarded as a passive information channel that provides insight into cognitive and affective states but defies any further control however in a recent study ehlers et al num we demonstrate that sympathetic activity indexed by pupil dynamics allows strategic interference by means of simple cognitive techniques utilizing positive negative imaginings subjects were able to expand pupil diameter beyond baseline variations albeit with varying degrees of success and only over brief periods the current study provides a comprehensive replication on the basis of considerable changes to the experimental set up results show that stricter methodological conditions controlled baseline settings and specified user instructions strengthen the reported effect whereas overall performance increases by one standard deviation effects are thereby not restricted to pupillary level parallel recordings of skin conductance changes prove a general enhancement of induced autonomic arousal considering the stability of the results across studies we conclude that pupil size information exceeds affective monitoring and may constitute an active input channel in human computer interaction furthermore since variations in pupil diameter reliably display self induced changes in sympathetic arousal the relevance of this parameter is strongly indicated for future approaches in clinical biofeedback
Arousal	using activity triggered e diaries to reveal the associations between physical activity and affective states in older adult s daily living evidence suggests that older adults show positive affects after participating in exercise bouts however it is less clear if and how physical activities in daily living enhance affective states too this is dissatisfying as most of older adults physical activities are part of their daily living to answer these questions we used activity triggered e diaries to investigate the within subject effects of physical activity on three dimensions of affective states valence energetic arousal calmness during everyday life older adults num between num and num years took part in the study during three consecutive days physical activity in daily living was objectively assessed using accelerometers affects were measured num min after a study participant surpassed a predefined threshold for activity or inactivity the participants were prompted by an acoustic signal to assess their momentary affective states on an e diary data were analyzed with hierarchical multilevel analyses whenever older individuals were more physically active they felt more energized energetic arousal and agitated calmness however they did not feel better valence interestingly body mass index and valence were associated in a significant cross level interaction acts as a moderating variable in the way that lower scores were associated with higher levels of valence scores after being physically active the innovative ambulatory assessment used here affords an interesting insight to the affective effects of daily activity of older adults these effects are no simple and no linear ones i e physical activity is not associated with positive affects per se as shown several times in experimental studies with single activity bouts rather there is a differentiating association seen as an enhanced feeling of energy and agitation which is not accompanied by a better feeling socio emotional selectivity theory may support the finding that older individuals are emotionally more stable during their day to day life which might explain the non significant effect on the affect dimension valence
Arousal	dissociable effects of valence and arousal in adaptive executive control based on introspectionist semantic and psychophysiological experimental frameworks it has long been assumed that all affective states derive from two independent basic dimensions valence and arousal however until now no study has investigated whether valence and arousal are also dissociable at the level of affect related changes in cognitive processing we examined how changes in both valence negative vs positive and arousal low vs high influence performance in tasks requiring executive control because recent research indicates that two dissociable cognitive components are involved in the regulation of task performance amount of current control i e strength of filtering goal irrelevant signals and control adaptation i e strength of maintaining current goals over time using a visual pop out distractor task we found that control is exclusively modulated by arousal because interference by goal irrelevant signals was largest in high arousal states independently of valence by contrast control adaptation is exclusively modulated by valence because the increase in control after trials in which goal irrelevant signals were present was largest in negative states independent of arousal monte carlo simulation revealed that differential effects of two experimental factors on control and control adaptation can be dissociated if there is no correlation between empirical interference and conflict driven modulation of interference which was the case in the present data consequently the observed effects of valence and arousal on adaptive executive control are indeed dissociable these findings indicate that affective influences on cognitive processes can be driven by independent effects of variations in valence and arousal which may resolve several heterogeneous findings observed in previous studies on affect cognition interactions
Arousal	affect contagion between mothers and infants examining valence and touch mothers and their babies represent one of the closest dyadic units and thus provide a powerful paradigm to examine how affective states are shared and result in synchronized physiologic responses between two people we recruited mothers and their num to num month old infants ndyads num to complete a lab study in which mothers were initially separated from their infants and assigned to either a low arousal positive relaxation condition intended to elicit parasympathetic nervous system reactivity or a high arousal negative stress task intended to elicit sympathetic nervous system reactivity upon reunion infants were placed either on their mothers laps touch condition or in a high chair next to the mother no touch condition we then examined if the babies and or responses changed from their baseline levels and how the dyads physiological responses both and responses synchronized over time as a function of mothers affect manipulation and touch condition three noteworthy findings were observed first infants of mothers assigned to the relaxation task showed greater increases and covariation second infants of mothers assigned to the stress task showed stronger covariation with their mothers over time finally infants who sat on their mothers laps i e touch condition showed stronger covariation than those in the no touch condition taken together these results suggest that mothers affective states low arousal positive states as well as high arousal negative states can be caught by their infants and that touch can play a critical role in stress contagion psycinfo database record
Arousal	the relationships between exercise and affective states a naturalistic longitudinal study of recreational runners background although people generally feel more positive and more energetic in the aftermath of exercise than before longitudinal research on how exercise relates to within person fluctuations in affect over the course of everyday life is still relatively limited one constraint on doing such research is the need to provide participants with accelerometers to objectively record their exercise and pagers to capture affective reports aims we aimed to develop a methodology for studying affect and exercise using only technology that participants already possess namely running watches and smartphones using this methodology we aimed to characterize within individual fluctuations in affective valence and arousal in relation to bouts of exercise and explore possible moderators of these fluctuations methods we recruited a sample of num recreational runners participants provided daily affective reports for six weeks using their smartphones information on their runs was harvested from their own devices via an online platform for athletes results average valence and arousal were higher on days when the person had run than on the next day and higher the day after a run than on the days after that over the course of the day of a run valence and arousal declined significantly as the time since the run increased physically fitter participants had more positive valence overall and this was particularly true when they had not run recently there was some evidence of higher dose i e longer and faster runs being associated with lower arousal on the next and subsequent days gender did not moderate associations between running and valence or arousal discussion our study demonstrated the potential for studying the associations between affect and exercise in a way that is precise undemanding for participants and convenient for researchers using technologies that participants already own and use
Arousal	physical activity increases after an affectively arousing daily life event evidence that structured physical activity can help to regulate affective state has spurred interest in identifying associations between unstructured physical activity and affective states during daily life the present study examined whether stressful daily life situations that elicit affective arousal also elicit increased physical activity in the form of restless movement the study compared the physical activity of professors n num after presenting a classroom lecture to their physical activity at the same time of day on a non lecture workday the expectation was that lecturing would increase affective arousal leading to greater restless movement following the lecture compared to the non lecture control day the study assessed subjective arousal to confirm that arousal was higher during the lecture the primary outcome measures were actigraphy measured standing and stepping times and number of steps and posture transitions results indicate that energetic and tense arousal were higher during the lecture than during the control period mean up time standing and stepping for the st minute of the num minute post lecture period was double that of the last minute num num num num s to num num num num s while it remained low throughout the comparison period on the control day p num num subjects also took more steps p num num and engaged in more transitions between sitting and standing p num num after the lecture than after the control period these results support the conclusion that stressful daily life situations that elicit affective arousal also elicit increased physical activity in the form of restless movement and suggest that affective responses to stressful situations may be important determinants of physical activity during daily life
Arousal	multivariate pattern classification reveals autonomic and experiential representations of discrete emotions defining the structural organization of emotions is a central unresolved question in affective science in particular the extent to which autonomic nervous system activity signifies distinct affective states remains controversial most prior research on this topic has used univariate statistical approaches in attempts to classify emotions from psychophysiological data in the present study electrodermal cardiac respiratory and gastric activity as well as self report measures were taken from healthy subjects during the experience of fear anger sadness surprise contentment and amusement in response to film and music clips information pertaining to affective states present in these response patterns was analyzed using multivariate pattern classification techniques overall accuracy for classifying distinct affective states was num num for autonomic measures and num num for self report measures both of which were significantly above chance further examining the error distribution of classifiers revealed that the dimensions of valence and arousal selectively contributed to decoding emotional states from self report whereas a categorical configuration of affective space was evident in both self report and autonomic measures taken together these findings extend recent multivariate approaches to study emotion and indicate that pattern classification tools may improve upon univariate approaches to reveal the underlying structure of emotional experience and physiological expression
Arousal	higher order multivariable polynomial regression to estimate human affective states from direct observations facial vocal gestural physiological and central nervous signals estimating human affective states through computational models such as multivariate linear regression analysis support vector regression and artificial neural network have been proposed in the past decade in these models linear models are generally lack of precision because of ignoring intrinsic nonlinearities of complex psychophysiological processes and nonlinear models commonly adopt complicated algorithms to improve accuracy and simplify model we introduce a new computational modeling method named as higher order multivariable polynomial regression to estimate human affective states the study employs standardized pictures in the international affective picture system to induce thirty subjects affective states and obtains pure affective patterns of skin conductance as input variables to the higher order multivariable polynomial model for predicting affective valence and arousal experimental results show that our method is able to obtain efficient correlation coefficients of num num and num num for estimation of affective valence and arousal respectively moreover the method may provide certain indirect evidences that valence and arousal have their brain s motivational circuit origins thus the proposed method can serve as a novel one for efficiently estimating human affective states
Arousal	motivational general arousal imagery does not improve decision making performance in elite endurance cyclists emotions are predicted to influence judgement and decision making across a range of performance contexts this experiment tested whether motivational general arousal imagery can improve the decision making performance of elite endurance cyclists in total num cyclists num men num women were assigned to either a positive imagery condition where positive images associated with the affective experience of winning were encouraged or a negative imagery condition where negative images associated with poor performance were encouraged the cyclists were read one of two scripts designed to elicit positive or negative images during a num min maximal sustainable interval on a cycle ergometer decision making task colour word match stroop was performed before and immediately after the maximal sustainable power interval results showed that the manipulation was successful with cyclists in the positive imagery condition reporting more positive affective states higher levels of happiness and lower levels of dejection than those in the negative imagery condition however there was no significant difference between the two groups in their decision making performance under physiological duress these findings indicate that while motivational general arousal imagery might be a useful method to induce positive emotions during exercise it is unlikely to improve the decision making performance of cyclists in performance relevant conditions
Arousal	conceptualising the impact of arousal and affective state on training outcomes of operant conditioning animal training relies heavily on an understanding of species specific behaviour as it integrates with operant conditioning principles following on from recent studies showing that affective states and arousal levels may correlate with behavioural outcomes we explore the contribution of both affective state and arousal in behavioural responses to operant conditioning this paper provides a framework for assessing how affective state and arousal may influence the efficacy of operant training methods it provides a series of three dimensional conceptual graphs as exemplars to describing putative influences of both affective state and arousal on the likelihood of dogs and horses performing commonly desired behaviours these graphs are referred to as response landscapes and they highlight the flexibility available for improving training efficacy and the likely need for different approaches to suit animals in different affective states and at various levels of arousal knowledge gaps are discussed and suggestions made for bridging them
Arousal	mathematical model captures the structure of subjective affect although it is possible to observe when another person is having an emotional moment we also derive information about the affective states of others from what they tell us they are feeling in an effort to distill the complexity of affective experience psychologists routinely focus on a simplified subset of subjective rating scales i e dimensions that capture considerable variability in reported affect reported valence i e how good or bad and reported arousal e g how strong is the emotion you are feeling still existing theoretical approaches address the basic organization and measurement of these affective dimensions differently some approaches organize affect around the dimensions of bipolar valence and arousal e g the circumplex model whereas alternative approaches organize affect around the dimensions of unipolar positivity and unipolar negativity e g the bivariate evaluative model in this report we a replicate the data structure observed when collected according to the two approaches described above and reinterpret these data to suggest that the relationship between each pair of affective dimensions is conditional on valence ambiguity and b formalize this structure with a mathematical model depicting a valence ambiguity dimension that decreases in range as arousal decreases a triangle this model captures variability in affective ratings better than alternative approaches increasing variance explained from num to over num without adding parameters
Arousal	two dimensional approach to assessing affective states in good and poor sleepers this study examined a two dimensional approach to assessing affective states among good and poor sleepers using the self assessment manikin a brief non verbal self report measure of affective states with separate ratings of valence and arousal sample of num undergraduate students completed the pittsburgh sleep quality index and the participants were classified post hoc as either good num or poor sleepers num using the and used the to rate their current affective states day and their affective state at bedtime night the previous night compared to good sleepers poor sleepers reported more negative affect and arousal at night and more negative affect during the day among poor sleepers lower sleep quality and shorter sleep duration on the components of the were associated with more negative daytime valence among good sleepers higher scores on the sleep medication and daytime dysfunction components of the were associated with more negative daytime valence these findings indicate that the appears to detect differences between good and poor sleepers on both valence and arousal of current daytime and retrospective night time emotional states this approach could be useful for the assessment of affective states related to sleep disturbance
Arousal	affective modulation of the acoustic startle does sadness engage the defensive system it has been suggested that high arousal negative affective states but not low arousal negative affective states potentiate the startle response because sadness has generally been studied as a low arousal emotion it remains unclear whether high arousal sadness would produce startle potentiation to a similar degree as high arousal fear to address this issue num participants viewed two sets of num min film clips selected to induce two affective states of high subjective arousal fear sadness and a neutral state of low subjective arousal while the eyeblink startle response associated with brief noise bursts was assessed using orbicularis oculi larger blink magnitude was found for fearful than for sad or neutral clips implications for conceptualizing sadness are discussed
Arousal	adolescents daily romantic experiences and negative mood dyadic intensive longitudinal study romantic relationships although increasingly normative during adolescence also present unique developmental challenges that can portend psychological difficulties underlying these difficulties may be the degree to which daily romantic transactions potentiate fluctuations in negative mood the present study examined associations between adolescents daily romantic relationship experiences and their same day negative affective states i e fluctuations in high arousal aversive mood using a dyadic ecological momentary assessment design this study followed an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample of num adolescent romantic couples twice weekly for num weeks n num individuals mage num num years num num num latina o num white num receiving free or reduced meals the results indicated that various daily romantic experiences e g conflict feelings about the relationship predicted greater same day negative affect beyond the effects of these romantic experiences adolescent couples were also synchronized in their fluctuating negative affective states evidencing the presence of emotional contagion overall the findings indicate the salience of romantic relationships in the everyday lives of adolescents
Arousal	prospective investigation of affect the desire to gamble gambling motivations and gambling behavior in the mood disorders time sampling methodology was implemented to examine the prospective associations between affect desire to gamble and gambling behavior in individuals diagnosed with a mood disorder thirty num male num female adults with a lifetime diagnosis of a depressive or bipolar disorder diagnosis who endorsed current gambling and lifetime gambling harm participated in the present study participants completed electronic diary entries of their current affective state desire to gamble and gambling behavior for num consecutive days hierarchical linear modelling revealed that affect was not a predictor of gambling behavior instead affect predicted the desire to gamble with high levels of sadness and arousal independently predicting an increased desire to gamble desire to gamble predicted actual gambling behavior there were no differences across diagnostic groups in terms of gambling motivations at baseline however during the num day period participants with bipolar disorder endorsed gambling to cope with negative affect more often than did participants with depressive disorder whereas those with depressive disorder more often endorsed gambling for social reasons or enhancement of positive affect the present findings provide evidence that negative affect is not directly related to actual gambling behavior and suggest that affective states rather impact the desire to gamble
Arousal	identifying core affect in individuals from fmri responses to dynamic naturalistic audiovisual stimuli recent research has demonstrated that affective states elicited by viewing pictures varying in valence and arousal are identifiable from whole brain activation patterns observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri identification of affective states from more naturalistic stimuli has clinical relevance but the feasibility of identifying these states on an individual trial basis from fmri data elicited by dynamic multimodal stimuli is unclear the goal of this study was to determine whether affective states can be similarly identified when participants view dynamic naturalistic audiovisual stimuli eleven participants viewed s audiovisual clips in a passive viewing task in the scanner valence and arousal for individual trials were identified both within and across participants based on distributed patterns of activity in areas selectively responsive to audiovisual naturalistic stimuli while controlling for lower level features of the stimuli in addition the brain regions identified by searchlight analyses to represent valence and arousal were consistent with previously identified regions associated with emotion processing these findings extend previous results on the distributed representation of affect to multimodal dynamic stimuli
Arousal	inference of human affective states from psychophysiological measurements extracted under ecologically valid conditions compared to standard laboratory protocols the measurement of psychophysiological signals in real world experiments poses technical and methodological challenges due to external factors that cannot be directly controlled to address this problem we propose a hybrid approach based on an immersive and human accessible space called the experience induction machine that incorporates the advantages of a laboratory within a life like setting the integrates unobtrusive wearable sensors for the acquisition of psychophysiological signals suitable for ambulatory emotion research in this paper we present results from two different studies conducted to validate the as a general purpose sensing infrastructure for the study of human affective states under ecologically valid conditions in the first investigation we recorded and classified signals from subjects exposed to pictorial stimuli corresponding to a range of arousal levels while they were free to walk and gesticulate in the second study we designed an experiment that follows the classical conditioning paradigm a well known procedure in the behavioral sciences with the additional feature that participants were free to move in the physical space as opposed to similar studies measuring physiological signals in constrained laboratory settings our results indicate that by using our sensing infrastructure it is indeed possible to infer human event elicited affective states through measurements of psychophysiological signals under ecological conditions
Arousal	neuroticism and extraversion magnify discrepancies between retrospective and concurrent affect reports although research often relies on retrospective affect self reports little is known about personality s role in retrospective reports and how these converge or deviate from affect reported in the moment this micro longitudinal study examines personality neuroticism extraversion and emotional salience peak and recent affect associations with retrospective momentary affect report discrepancies over different time frames participants were num adults aged num num num num years num num caucasian white who each provided up to num concurrent affect reports over num days then retrospectively reported overall intensity of each affective state after num day and again after num num months multilevel models revealed that individuals retrospectively overreported or underreported various affective states exhibiting peak associations for high arousal positive and negative affect recency associations for low arousal positive affect and distinct personality profiles that strengthened over time individuals high in both extraversion and neuroticism exaggerated high arousal positive and negative affect and underreported low arousal positive affect high extraversion low neuroticism individuals exaggerated high arousal positive affect and underreported low arousal positive affect and low extraversion high neuroticism individuals exaggerated high and low arousal negative affect this study is the first to identify arousal specific retrospective affect report discrepancies over time and suggests retrospective reports also reflect personality differences in affective self knowledge
Arousal	using objective real time measures to investigate the effect of actual physical activity on affective states in everyday life differentiating the contexts of working and leisure time in a sample with students multiple studies suggest that physical activity causes positive affective reactions and reduces depressive mood however studies and interventions focused mostly on structured activity programs but rarely on actual physical activity apa in daily life furthermore they seldom account for the context in which the apa occur e g work leisure using a prospective real time assessment design ambulatory assessment we investigated the effects of apa on affective states valence energetic arousal calmness in real time during everyday life while controlling for the context eighty seven undergraduates students age num num num num females num participated in this study apa was assessed through accelerometers during num h palmtop devices prompted subjects approximately every num min during a num h daytime period to assess their affective states and the context we analyzed within and between person effects with hierarchical modeling num num multilevel analyses revealed that both apa and context influenced subsequent affective states the interaction of apa and context did predict energetic arousal only state levels of affects did not differ between men and women for both men and women apa in everyday life has an effect on individual s affective states for valence and calmness it seems to be independent of the context in which the apa occur for energetic arousal men reported to have lower feelings of energy and women reported to have more feelings of energy during leisure time compared to working episodes
Arousal	from specificity to sensitivity affective states modulate visual working memory for emotional expressive faces previous findings suggest that visual working memory preferentially remembers angry looking faces however the meaning of facial actions is construed in relation to context to date there are no studies investigating the role of perceiver based context when processing emotional cues in to explore the influence of affective context on for faces we conducted two experiments using both a task for emotionally expressive faces and a mood induction procedure affective context was manipulated by unpleasant experiment num and pleasant experiment num pictures in order to induce an affect high in motivational intensity defensive or appetitive respectively compared to a low arousal control condition results indicated specifically increased sensitivity of for angry looking faces in the neutral condition enhanced for angry faces was prevented by inducing affects of high motivational intensity in both experiments affective states led to a switch from specific enhancement of angry expressions in to an equally sensitive representation of all emotional expressions our findings demonstrate that emotional expressions are of different behavioral relevance for the receiver depending on the affective context supporting a functional organization of along with flexible resource allocation in stimulus processing adjusts to situational requirements and transitions from a specifically prioritizing default mode in predictable environments to a sensitive hypervigilant mode in exposure to emotional events
Arousal	the neural representation of an individualized relational affective space humans experience emotions every day traditionally psychology has described emotions through discrete labels e g happy afraid or standardized affective dimensions e g valence arousal and neuroscience has more recently sought the neurobiological basis of emotions via functional neuroimaging however by treating emotions similarly among everyone we neglect that emotions are individualized thus the overall relational structure of an individual s emotion information may be vital in understanding how the brain represents emotions combining behavioral and functional experiments with similarity analyses we demonstrate that neural activity patterns in the left insula correspond to the multi dimensional arrangement of individuals affective spaces despite interindividual differences better than to a group averaged model of affective space a standardized valence arousal space a semantic category space and a visual similarity space this finding suggests that the insula may underlie individual level affective information processing that is specific to one s own affective states which offers new opportunities for functional neuroimaging to inform clinical approaches of disorders involving emotion dysregulation
Arousal	recognition of intensive valence and arousal affective states via facial electromyographic activity in young and senior adults research suggests that interaction between humans and digital environments characterizes a form of companionship in addition to technical convenience to this effect humans have attempted to design computer systems able to demonstrably empathize with the human affective experience facial electromyography is one such technique enabling machines to access to human affective states numerous studies have investigated the effects of valence emotions on facial activity captured over the corrugator supercilii frowning muscle and zygomaticus major smiling muscle the arousal emotion specifically has not received much research attention however in the present study we sought to identify intensive valence and arousal affective states via facial activity ten blocks of affective pictures were separated into five categories neutral valence low arousal positive valence high arousal negative valence high arousal positive valence low arousal and negative valence low arousal and the ability of each to elicit corresponding valence and arousal affective states was investigated at length one hundred and thirteen participants were subjected to these stimuli and provided facial set of num features based on the amplitude frequency predictability and variability of signals was defined and classified using a support vector machine we observed highly accurate classification rates based on the combined corrugator and zygomaticus ranging from num num to num num for the baseline and five affective states and in all individuals there were significant differences in classification rate accuracy between senior and young adults but there was no significant difference between female and male participants our research provides robust evidences for recognition of intensive valence and arousal affective states in young and senior adults these findings contribute to the successful future application of facial for identifying user affective states in human machine interaction or companion robotic systems

Arousal	measuring positive emotions in cows do visible eye whites tell us anything insight into the emotional lives of animals is of utmost importance to the welfare of the billions of animals in our care yet little is known about how to measure these states scientific understanding of how to measure and interpret positive emotional states is particularly lacking although recent years have seen a notable increase in such studies this study explored whether the percentage of visible eye whites is a valid measure of a low arousal positive emotional state in dairy cows bos taurus by using stroking as the positive stimulus thirteen dairy cows were studied over a period of two months and a total of num full minute focal observations were performed each focal observation comprised three minute phases pre stroking baseline stroking stimulus and post stroking post stimulus and the focal cow s behaviours were recorded throughout each observation and the focal eye was filmed for later analysis following data collection we calculated the percentage of visible eye white at nine pre determined measurement points throughout each focal observation the eye white data were analysed using the one way repeated measures test the percentage of visible eye white dropped during stroking compared with during both the pre stroking and post stroking phases num num num num num num num the behaviours were analysed using friedman s and wilcoxon s signed rank test behaviours known to be associated with positive emotions in cows were performed during the stroking phase of the focal observation supporting the use of stroking as a stimulus to induce a positive low arousal emotional state this study has explored the potential of visible eye whites as a measure of positive emotions and arousal and our results support previous studies which suggest that eye whites may serve as a dynamic measure of emotion and arousal
Arousal	classifying affective states using thermal infrared imaging of the human face in this paper time frequency and time frequency features derived from thermal infrared data are used to discriminate between self reported affective states of an individual in response to visual stimuli drawn from the international affective pictures system total of six binary classification tasks were examined to distinguish baseline and affect states affect states were determined from subject reported levels of arousal and valence mean adjusted accuracies of num to num were achieved for the baseline classifications tasks classification accuracies between high and low ratings of arousal and valence were between num and num respectively our analysis showed that facial thermal infrared imaging data of baseline and other affective states may be separable the results of this study suggest that classification of facial thermal infrared imaging data coupled with affect models can be used to provide information about an individual s affective state for potential use as a passive communication pathway
Arousal	multiple output support vector machine regression with feature selection for arousal valence space emotion assessment human emotion recognition allows the assessment of an affective state of a subject until recently such emotional states were described in terms of discrete emotions like happiness or contempt in order to cover a high range of emotions researchers in the field have introduced different dimensional spaces for emotion description that allow the characterization of affective states in terms of several variables or dimensions that measure distinct aspects of the emotion one of the most common of such dimensional spaces is the bidimensional arousal valence space to the best of our knowledge all systems so far have modelled independently the dimensions in these dimensional spaces in this paper we study the effect of modelling the output dimensions simultaneously and show experimentally the advantages in modeling them in this way we consider a multimodal approach by including features from the electroencephalogram and a few physiological signals for modelling the multiple outputs we employ a multiple output regressor based on support vector machines we also include an stage of feature selection that is developed within an embedded approach known as recursive feature elimination proposed initially for the results show that several features can be eliminated using the multiple output support vector regressor with without affecting the performance of the regressor from the analysis of the features selected in smaller subsets via it can be observed that the signals that are more informative into the arousal and valence space discrimination are the electrooculogram electromiogram and the galvanic skin response
Arousal	computational psychometrics in communication and implications in decision making recent investigations emphasized the role of communication features on behavioral trust and reciprocity in economic decision making but no studies have been focused on the effect of communication on affective states in such a context thanks to advanced methods of computational psychometrics in this study affective states were deeply examined using simultaneous and synchronized recordings of gazes and psychophysiological signals in num female students during an investment game results showed that participants experienced different affective states according to the type of communication personal versus impersonal in particular participants involved in personal communication felt more relaxed than participants involved in impersonal communication moreover personal communication influenced reciprocity and participants perceptions about trust and reciprocity findings were interpreted in the light of the arousal valence model and self disclosure process

Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	anxiety overrides the blocking effects of high perceptual load on amygdala reactivity to threat related distractors amygdala reactivity to threat related distractor stimuli can be abolished in perceptually demanding contexts premised on the biological imperative to respond swiftly to threat we demonstrate however that when participants are threatened by shock greater amygdala responses to fearful compared to neutral distractor faces is preserved under conditions of high attentional demand lateral prefrontal cortices also showed selective responding to fearful distractor faces under these conditions suggesting that threat related distractor stimuli engaged attentional control mechanisms we conclude that anxiety elicited by looming threat promotes neurocognitive processes that broaden attention and enhance sensitivity to potential danger cues even when perceptual systems are taxed
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	the moderating effect of self reported state and trait anxiety on the late positive potential to emotional faces in num num year old children introduction the emergence of anxiety during childhood is accompanied by the development of attentional biases to threat however the neural mechanisms underlying these biases are poorly understood in addition previous research has not examined whether state and trait anxiety are independently associated with threat related biases methods we compared waveforms during the processing of emotional faces in a population sample of num num num year olds who completed self reported measures of trait and state anxiety and depression results the results showed that the was larger to angry than neutral faces in the left hemisphere though early components were not strongly associated with child anxiety or depression in contrast late positive potential amplitudes to angry vs neutral faces were significantly and positively associated with symptoms of anxiety depression in addition the difference between lpps for angry vs neutral faces was independently associated with state and trait anxiety symptoms discussion the results showed that neural responses to facial emotion in children with elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression were most evident at later processing stages characterized as evaluative and effortful the findings support cognitive models of threat perception in anxiety and indicate that trait elements of anxiety and more transitory fluctuations in anxious affect are important in understanding individual variation in the neural response to threat in late childhood

Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	movements indicate threat response phases in children at risk for anxiety temporal phases of threat response including potential threat anxiety acute threat startle fear and post threat response modulation have been identified as the underlying markers of anxiety disorders objective measures of response during these phases may help identify children at risk for anxiety however the complexity of current assessment techniques prevent their adoption in many research and clinical contexts we propose an alternative technology an inertial measurement unit that enables noninvasive measurement of the movements associated with threat response and test its ability to detect threat response phases in young children at a heightened risk for developing anxiety we quantified the motion of num children num num years old during an anxiety fear provoking behavioral task using an specifically measurements from a single secured to the child s waist were used to extract root mean square acceleration and angular velocity in the horizontal and vertical directions and tilt and yaw range of motion during each threat response phase measurements detected expected differences in child motion by threat phase additionally potential threat motion was positively correlated to familial anxiety risk startle range of motion was positively correlated with child internalizing symptoms and response modulation motion was negatively correlated to familial anxiety risk results suggest differential theory driven threat response phases and support previous literature connecting maternal child risk to anxiety with behavioral measures using more feasible objective methods this is the first study demonstrating the utility of an for characterizing the motion of young children to mark the phases of threat response modulation the technique provides a novel and objective measure of threat response for mental health researchers
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	maternal anxiety predicts attentional bias towards threat in infancy although cognitive theories of psychopathology suggest that attention bias toward threat plays a role in the etiology and maintenance of anxiety there is relatively little evidence regarding individual differences in the earliest development of attention bias toward threat the current study examines attention bias toward threat during its potential first emergence by evaluating the relations between attention bias and known risk factors of anxiety i e temperamental negative affect and maternal anxiety we measured attention bias to emotional faces in infants num num male ages num to num months during an attention disengagement eye tracking paradigm we hypothesized that a there would be an attentional bias toward threat in the full sample of infants replicating previous studies b attentional bias toward threat would be positively related to maternal anxiety and c attention bias toward threat would be positively related to temperamental negative affect finally d we explored the potential interaction between temperament and maternal anxiety in predicting attention bias toward threat we found that attention bias to the affective faces did not change with age and that bias was not related to temperament however attention bias to threat but not attention bias to happy faces was positively related to maternal anxiety such that higher maternal anxiety predicted a larger attention bias for all infants these findings provide support for attention bias as a putative early mechanism by which early markers of risk are associated with socioemotional development psycinfo database record
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	content specificity of attention bias to threat in anxiety disorders a meta analysis despite the established evidence for threat related attention bias in anxiety the mechanisms underlying this bias remain unclear one important unresolved question is whether disorder congruent threats capture attention to a greater extent than do more general or disorder incongruent threat stimuli evidence for attention bias specificity in anxiety would implicate involvement of previous learning and memory processes in threat related attention bias whereas lack of content specificity would point to perturbations in more generic attention processes enhanced clarity of mechanism could have clinical implications for the stimuli types used in attention bias modification treatments content specificity of threat related attention bias in anxiety and potential moderators of this effect were investigated systematic search identified num samples from num articles num relevant data were extracted based on specific coding rules and cohen s d effect size was used to estimate bias specificity effects the results indicate greater attention bias toward disorder congruent relative to disorder incongruent threat stimuli d num num p num num this effect was not moderated by age type of anxiety disorder visual attention tasks or type of disorder incongruent stimuli no evidence of publication bias was observed implications for threat bias in anxiety and are discussed
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	objective and perceived arousal during performance of tasks with elements of social threat the influence of anxiety sensitivity physiological arousal serves to maintain social anxiety disorder by skewing self perception anxiety sensitivity is associated with the disorder and exaggerated perceptions of arousal but has not been tested as explaining exaggerated perceived arousal in social contexts the aim of this investigation was to address this issue total of num individuals participated in three tasks associated with potential social threat i e a speech typing task hyperventilation and completed measures of trait social anxiety and anxiety sensitivity state anxiety perceived arousal and objective arousal were assessed during each task trait social anxiety and anxiety sensitivity were correlated with state anxiety and perceived arousal but not objective arousal during the tasks anxiety sensitivity mediated the relationships between trait social anxiety and perceived arousal and between trait social anxiety and state anxiety for the typing and hyperventilation tasks although the sample likely included a number of individuals with social anxiety disorder the sample was mostly comprised of individuals without a diagnosis the current results can be extended to clinical presentations to some extent but future research is needed to further explore the demonstrated relationships in samples of individuals with social anxiety disorder anxiety sensitivity may play a crucial role in perceptions of arousal and state anxiety in the context of potential social threats warranting attention from researchers and clinicians focussing on social anxiety disorder
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	the unpredictive brain under threat neurocomputational account of anxious hypervigilance anxious hypervigilance is marked by sensitized sensory perceptual processes and attentional biases to potential danger cues in the environment how this is realized at the neurocomputational level is unknown but could clarify the brain mechanisms disrupted in psychiatric conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder predictive coding instantiated by dynamic causal models provides a promising framework to ground these state related changes in the dynamic interactions of reciprocally connected brain areas anxiety states were elicited in healthy participants n num by exposure to the threat of unpredictable aversive shocks while undergoing magnetoencephalography an auditory oddball sequence was presented to measure cortical responses related to deviance detection and dynamic causal models quantified deviance related changes in effective connectivity participants were also administered alprazolam double blinded placebo controlled crossover to determine whether the cortical effects of threat induced anxiety are reversed by acute anxiolytic treatment deviant tones elicited increased auditory cortical responses under threat bayesian analyses revealed that hypervigilant responding was best explained by increased postsynaptic gain in primary auditory cortex activity as well as modulation of feedforward but not feedback coupling within a temporofrontal cortical network increasing inhibitory gamma aminobutyric acidergic action with alprazolam reduced anxiety and restored feedback modulation within the network threat induced anxiety produced unbalanced feedforward signaling in response to deviations in predicable sensory input amplifying ascending sensory prediction error signals may optimize stimulus detection in the face of impending threats at the same time diminished descending sensory prediction signals impede perceptual learning and may therefore underpin some of the deleterious effects of anxiety on higher order cognition
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	discovering networks altered by potential threat anxiety using quadratic discriminant analysis researchers have only recently begun using functional neuroimaging to explore the human response to periods of sustained anxious anticipation namely potential threat here we investigated brain responses acquired with functional during an instructed threat of shock paradigm used to create sustained periods of aversive anticipation in this re analysis of previously published data we employed quadratic discriminant analysis to classify the multivariate pattern of whole brain functional connectivity and to identify connectivity changes during periods of potential threat our method identifies clusters with altered connectivity on a voxelwise basis thus eschewing the need to define regions a priori classifier generalization was evaluated by testing on data from participants not used during training robust classification between threat and safe contexts was possible and inspection of diagnostic features revealed altered functional connectivity involving the intraparietal sulcus task negative regions striatum and anterior cingulate cortex we anticipate that the proposed method will prove useful to experimenters wishing to identify large scale functional networks that distinguish between experimental conditions or groups
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	cognitive vulnerabilities in parents as a potential risk factor for anxiety symptoms in young adult offspring an exploration of looming cognitive style given that anxiety runs in families it is critical to understand the cognitive factors that may be responsible for this intergenerational transmission the present study offers a first step by exploring the link between mother and father tendencies to view potentially threatening situations as rapidly escalating toward dreaded outcomes i e looming cognitive style and the emotional disturbances and looming cognitive styles of their adult offspring we assessed cognitive vulnerabilities anxiety and depressive symptoms in a non clinical sample num of italian college students and their parents the looming cognitive style of fathers but not mothers was significantly related to greater anxiety in adult offspring this finding was obtained for both sons and daughters and remained even after statistically controlling for the anxiety worry depressive symptoms and anxiety sensitivity of parents notably the association between fathers looming cognitive style and offspring symptoms was not related to their child s depressive symptoms and similar to prior work served as a cognitive marker specific to anxiety the present study relied on a cross sectional design and did not use clients diagnosed with anxiety disorders the findings suggest that it may prove fruitful to consider parental vulnerabilities such as looming cognitive styles in comprehensive cognitive and interpersonal models of anxiety the intergenerational transmission of emotional difficulties seems to extend beyond anxiety to beliefs about the escalation of threat

Sleep_Wakefulness	ultradian rhythmicity in sleep wakefulness is related to color in nestling barn owls the possession of a rhythm is usually described as an important adaptation to regular changing environmental conditions such as the light dark cycle however recent studies have suggested plasticity in the expression of a rhythm depending on life history and environmental factors barn owl tyto alba nestlings show variations in behavior and physiology in relation to the size of black feather spots a trait associated with many behavioral and physiological phenotypes including the circadian expression of corticosterone and the regulation of body mass this raises the possibility that individual spottiness could be associated with rhythmicity in sleep wakefulness owlets showed ultradian rhythms in sleep wakefulness with a period length of num num to num num h the period length of wakefulness and non sleep was shorter in heavily compared to lightly spotted female nestlings whereas in males the opposite result was found furthermore male and female nestlings displaying small black spots showed strong rhythmicity levels in wakefulness and sleep this might be an advantage in a stable environment with predictable periodic changes in light temperature or social interactions heavily spotted nestlings displayed weak rhythms in wakefulness and sleep which might enable them to be more flexible in reactions to unexpected events such as predation or might be a mechanism to save energy these findings are consistent with previous findings showing that large spotted nestlings switch more frequently between wakefulness and sleep resulting in higher levels of vigilance compared to small spotted conspecifics thus nestlings with larger black feather spots might differently handle the trade off between wakefulness and sleep attention and social interactions compared to nestlings with smaller black spots

Sleep_Wakefulness	acute psychosis associated with dissociated sleep wakefulness state after mirtazapine treatment tricyclic antidepressants decrease rapid eye movement sleep and may suppress sleep atonia reports indicate that these agents can induce visual hallucinations sometimes characterized as hypnopompic or associated with a dissociated sleep wakefulness state in addition disturbing dreams and confusional states were reported during clinical trials and in subsequent studies to our knowledge only two cases of nightmares associated with mirtazapine a tetracyclic antidepressant have been previously reported we describe a num year old caucasian man with major depressive disorder who started mirtazapine num mg at bedtime because he had poor symptom control with other antidepressant drugs three days later vivid dream activity was noted evolving into realistic nightmares that the patient was not able to distinguish from reality on awakening acute paranoia was suspected and haloperidol was started the dream activity then ended and within num days the patient was able to identify the dreams as unreality haloperidol was discontinued but mirtazapine was continued and the vivid dream activity persisted however reality testing when awake was intact short course of haloperidol restored the patient s reality testing and mirtazapine was eventually replaced with bupropion the unusual nocturnal activity resolved as a result clinicians should be aware of the possible transition from exceptionally vivid dreams to sleep behavior disorder and psychosis based on dream content as an adverse effect of mirtazapine
Sleep_Wakefulness	clinical evolution of seizures distribution across time of day and sleep wakefulness cycle seizures can evolve sequentially into different clinical phases for example a seizure may start as an aura first phase then evolve into a tonic seizure second phase and evolve further into a generalized tonic clonic semiology third phase it is currently unknown whether specific seizure evolutions cluster at particular times of the day and or during sleep wakefulness we aimed to describe the distribution of the clinical evolution of seizures across time of day and sleep wake state we included all patients with at least two seizure phases admitted for long term electroencephalogram monitoring during a num year period two hundred and fifteen patients num seizures presented with two different phases and num patients num seizures evolved into a third clinical phase during phase two evolution into clonic seizures differed across time p num num with peaks at num num h and num num h and during sleep p num num evolution into automotor seizures peaked during wakefulness p num num evolution into tonic seizures differed across time p num num with peaks at num num h and during sleep p num num and generalized tonic clonic seizures peaked during sleep p num num findings remained statistically significant after multivariable analysis adjusting separately for potential confounders semiology of the first phase age gender days in the long term electroencephalographic monitoring unit abnormal neuroimaging number of antiepileptic medications and seizure localization during phase three seizure evolutions followed the same pattern of distribution as during phase two but differences did not reach statistical significance our data demonstrate that the evolution of seizures into different phases cluster at specific times of day and at specific phases of the sleep wakefulness cycle
Sleep_Wakefulness	shift rotation and age interactions with sleep wakefulness and inflammation the interaction of age with shift rotation in relation to sleep wakefulness and inflammation were studied among male employees n num cross sectional analyses in day two shift and three shift work with different shift rotations as well as changes in leukocytes and hscrp among three shift workers who changed their shift system during the num num yr follow up were completed shift work was associated with problems to fall asleep p num num and feeling of the current working time being harmful to sleep and wakefulness p num num quickly forward rotation shift workers considered their working time less harmful compared with slower backward rotation shift workers age did not influence sleep in general but older workers in the quickly forward rotating three shift system had less sleep complaints than their younger colleagues the age differences in the inflammatory markers partly depended on the shift system the results give some support that rapidly forward rotating shift systems are more age friendly than backward rotating shift systems

Sleep_Wakefulness	arousal transitions in sleep wakefulness and anesthesia are characterized by an orderly sequence of cortical events many aspects of brain function are influenced by modulatory processes including arousal the most abrupt changes in arousal occur at the wake sleep transition and at the induction of anesthetic conditions they are accompanied by major electrophysiological changes including an emergence of low frequency sleep like activity and a loss of mid frequency wake like activity that has been linked to feedback processes of the brain nevertheless the causal relationship between these two types of electrophysiological changes as well as the cortical mechanisms underlying changes in arousal and consciousness remain poorly understood to address this we studied spontaneous electro cortical activity during arousal changes in macaques during sleep and at loss of consciousness induced by propofol anesthesia we identified a prototypical sequence of cortical events in which the loss of mid frequency activity preceded by seconds the increases in low frequency activity furthermore in visual areas an influence of mid frequency change onto high frequency activity was observed across visual hierarchy these results are consistent with the notion that drops in arousal and consciousness are facilitated by a release of feedback cortical inhibition
Sleep_Wakefulness	hypothalamic orexine system accelerates regulation of sleep homeostasis and sleep wakefulness cycle recovery from barbiturate anesthesia induced artificial sleep the work was aimed for the ascertainment of following question whether orexin containing neurons of dorsal and lateral hypothalamus and brain orexinergic system in general are those cellular targets which can accelerate recovery of disturbed sleep homeostasis and restoration of sleep wakefulness cycle behavioral states from barbiturate anesthesia induced artificial sleep investigation was carried out on num wild type white rats weight num gr different doses of nembutal sodium were used for the initiation of deep anesthesia num min after barbiturate anesthesia induced artificial sleep serial electrical stimulations of dorsal or lateral hypothalamus were started stimulation period lasted for num hour with the num min intervals between subsequent stimulations applied by turn to the left and right side hypothalamic parts registration of cortical and hippocampal electrical activity was started num min after intra peritoneal administration of nembutal sodium and continued continuously during num hour according to obtained new evidences serial electrical stimulations of dorsal and lateral hypothalamic orexin containing neurons significantly accelerate recovery of wakefulness sleep homeostasis disturbed because of barbiturate anesthesia induced artificial sleep and different behavioral states of sleep wakefulness cycle hypothalamic orexin containing neurons can be considered as the cellular targets for regulating of sleep homeostasis through the acceleration of recovery of wakefulness and in general from barbiturate anesthesia induced deep sleep
Sleep_Wakefulness	reflection of tolerance to alcohol in the structure of the sleep wakefulness cycle the purpose of the present work was to study the effects of tolerance to ethanol on the sleep wakefulness cycle structure experiments were carried out in chronic conditions on the adult cats n num the following methods were used the stereotaxic for implanting electrodes polysomnographic for registration of the structure alcoholisation num num num num g kg num ethanol solution was conducted by intraperitoneal injections that lasted for two weeks the obtained results were processed statistically and significance of the changes was determined by the student t test low single doses of ethanol num num num num g kg did not induce any significant changes in the structure of the while using doses of num num g kg it was noted only increasing of the latent period of the onset of sleep however the structure of the recovered within num num hours after injection increasing the dose to num g kg caused severe intoxication this was reflected in a behavioral anxiety tremor vocalizations and autonomic vomiting and frequent urination signs against the background of restless behavioral wakefulness synchronization of the characteristic of light slow wave sleep developed the volume of deep slow wave sleep was statistically significantly decreased and the latent period of the onset of paradoxical sleep was increased the structure of sleep was fragmented due to frequent awakenings for the fifth eighth day of alcoholization the structure of the restored behavioral and vegetative signs of intoxication disappeared which must indicate the development of tolerance to this dose of ethanol the obtained results signify that development of tolerance to ethanol can be reflected in the alteration of the structure of alcoholization disturbs the subtle mechanisms of the sleep due to destruction of brain homeostasis
Sleep_Wakefulness	interaction of age with shift related sleep wakefulness sleepiness performance and social life it is not clear how the age related changes in sleep are related to performance and subjective sleepiness at different time of the day the aim of the present study was to study work shift related interactions of age with sleep wakefulness performance and social life representative sample of aircraft maintenance workers in a continuous three shift system was studied by a questionnaire n num and an on site field n num study in the field study sleep length and quality and different ratings of social and other activities were studied with an actigraphy and a pocket diary during num consecutive days subjective sleepiness and vigilance performance were registered at work although the shift type influenced the sleep subjective sleepiness performance and social life age was distinctly related only to shift related changes in the amount of sleep subjective sleepiness and psychomotor vigilance night shifts were related with shorter sleep decreased performance and increased sleepiness although subjective sleepiness was greatest among the youngest num num years age group during the morning and the night shifts the increase of performance lapses was higher among the middle aged num num years and senior num num years groups during the night shifts compared to the youngest age group according to the questionnaire older shiftworkers also tended to perceive more frequently that subjective sleepiness decreases their work performance during the morning and night shifts the results indicate of no direct link between age related differences in subjective sleepiness and performance at night work the shorter day sleep after the night shifts and higher deterioration of subjective and objective performance according to age urge on development of shift schedules aiming at lower fatigue levels during the night shifts

Sleep_Wakefulness	effects of smoking exposure in infants on gastroesophageal reflux as a function of the sleep wakefulness state to determine whether perinatal smoking exposure is associated with gastroesophageal reflux related changes in sleep wakefulness states in neonates thirty one neonates referred for the investigation of suspected were recruited and underwent multichannel impedance ph monitoring and synchronized num to num hour polysomnography the infants exposure to tobacco smoke was estimated by means of a urine cotinine assay the total number frequency h num and mean duration minutes of ph reflux events detected by the ph electrode only and imp reflux events with bolus movement detected by impedance events were determined intergroup differences smoking exposed group vs nonexposed group were probed with nonparametric unpaired mann whitney tests chi num test was used to assess a possible intergroup difference in bolus retrograde migration during imp events according to the urine cotinine assay num of the num neonates had been exposed to cigarette smoke during the perinatal period the number and frequency of imp was significantly greater num in the exposed group num num num than in the nonexposed group num num num migration of the esophageal bolus from the distal segment to the most proximal segment was significantly more frequent num in the exposed group num of than in the nonexposed group num the pattern associated with smoking exposure was particularly obvious during rapid eye movement sleep the more frequent occurrence and greater proximal migration of imp in the smoking exposed group especially during rapid eye movement sleep may have clinical relevance smoking exposure is a preventable risk factor for limiting the occurrence of in neonates
Sleep_Wakefulness	relationship between sleep wakefulness and gastroesophageal reflux in symptomatic newborns the state of sleep wakefulness is well known to influence esophageal acid exposure and the number of acid refluxes whereas it is uncertain whether the same is true of the non acid refluxes that predominate in the newborns to investigate the relationship between sleep wakefulness and refluxes num newborns with gastroesophageal reflux symptoms were studied with combined multichannel intraluminal impedance and ph monitoring we found that sleep wakefulness influenced acid and weakly acidic reflux frequency awake num num num num asleep num num num num p num num negative correlation was found between sleepness periods and the mean reflux duration for both acid num num p num num and weackly acidic num num p num num refluxes this finding may raise some concerns about the over prescription of antacid drugs in newborns
Sleep_Wakefulness	hypocretin orexin neuropeptides participation in the control of sleep wakefulness cycle and energy homeostasis hypocretins or orexins hcrt orx are hypothalamic neuropeptides that are synthesized by neurons located mainly in the perifornical area of the posterolateral hypothalamus these hypothalamic neurons are the origin of an extensive and divergent projection system innervating numerous structures of the central nervous system in recent years it has become clear that these neuropeptides are involved in the regulation of many organic functions such as feeding thermoregulation and neuroendocrine and cardiovascular control as well as in the control of the sleep wakefulness cycle in this respect hcrt orx activate two subtypes of protein coupled receptors hcrt orxr and hcrt orxr that show a partly segregated and prominent distribution in neural structures involved in sleep wakefulness regulation wakefulness enhancing and or sleep suppressing actions of hcrt orx have been reported in specific areas of the brainstem moreover presently there are animal models of human narcolepsy consisting in modifications of hcrt orx receptors or absence of these peptides this strongly suggests that narcolepsy is the direct consequence of a hypofunction of the hcrt orx system which is most likely due to hcrt orx neurons degeneration the main focus of this review is to update and illustrate the available data on the actions of hcrt orx neuropeptides with special interest in their participation in the control of the sleep wakefulness cycle and the regulation of energy homeostasis current pharmacological treatment of narcolepsy is also discussed
Sleep_Wakefulness	roles of orexin hypocretin in regulation of sleep wakefulness and energy homeostasis the finding of orexin hypocretin deficiency in patients with narcolepsy suggests that this hypothalamic neuropeptide plays a crucial role in regulating and maintaining sleep wakefulness states and energy homeostasis orexin might be especially important for stabilization of behavioral states because the major symptom in narcolepsy is instability of each behavioral state which results in sleep wakefulness fragmentation the efferent and afferent systems of orexin neurons suggest interactions between these cells and arousal sleep wakefulness centers in the brainstem as well as important feeding centers in the hypothalamus electrophysiological studies have shown that orexin neurons are regulated by monoamines and acetylcholine as well as metabolic cues including leptin glucose and ghrelin thus orexin neurons have the requisite functional interactions with hypothalamic feeding pathways and monoaminergic cholinergic centers and provide a critical link between peripheral energy balance and the central mechanisms that coordinate sleep wakefulness and motivated behavior such as food seeking
Sleep_Wakefulness	modulation by the hypocretinergic orexinergic neurotransmission system in sleep wakefulness cycle states the hypocretins orexins are neuropeptides synthesized by a small neuronal cell group located in the posterior and lateral hypothalamus these peptides have been considered modulators of the sleep wakefulness cycle since their discovery in num the hypocretinergic orexinergic system is very active during wakefulness in addition the absence of either these peptides or their receptors is associated to narcolepsy cataplexy a disease in which the sleep wakefulness cycle is completely disorganized hypocretinergic orexinergic neurons directly activate the cerebral cortex and neuronal cell groups of the reticular activating system containing noradrenaline serotonin dopamine acetylcholine and histamine through which they may also indirectly activate the cerebral cortex and enhance wakefulness as well these neurons inhibit sleep generation in the ventral pontine tegmentum the decrease in the activity of hypocretinergic orexinergic neurons during sleep inhibits the aminergic and cholinergic neurons of the reticular activating core decreasing cortical activation and renewing sleep generation in the ventral pontine tegmentum hypocretins orexins modulate wakefulness and activation in part through their actions on reticular core neurons projecting to the cortex and suppress sleep generation through inhibition of ventral pontine tegmentum neurons within the ventral oral pontine tegmentum the hypoactivity of this system supports the sleep cycle fragmentation and general disorganization appearing in narcolepsy as well as momentary interruption of wakefulness by sleep episodes

Sleep_Wakefulness	hypothalamic neuropeptides implicated in the regulation of sleep wakefulness states several neuropeptides including galanin orexin melanin concentrating hormone urocortin num pituitary adenylate cyclase activating protein and vasoactive intestinal peptide have been implicated in the regulation of sleep wakefulness states in particular neuropeptides produced in the hypothalamus including galanin orexin and have been shown to play crucial roles galanin is localized to the prepotic area of the hypothalamus and is likely to be involved in the promotion and maintenance of sleep which is expressed by neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area seems to be implicated in rapid eye movement sleep regulation orexins are also localized in the and have been established as one of the most important factors in the regulation of sleep wakefulness states series of studies have suggested that orexin deficiency causes narcolepsy in humans and other mammalian species highlighting the roles of this hypothalamic neuropeptide in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness studies of efferent and afferent systems of orexin producing neurons have shown that the orexin neuronal system has close interactions with the systems that regulate emotion energy homeostasis reward and arousal these observations suggest that orexin neurons are involved in sensing the body s external and internal environments and regulate vigilance states accordingly
Sleep_Wakefulness	the physiological role of orexin hypocretin neurons in the regulation of sleep wakefulness and neuroendocrine functions the hypothalamus monitors body homeostasis and regulates various behaviors such as feeding thermogenesis and sleeping orexins also known as hypocretins were identified as endogenous ligands for two orphan protein coupled receptors in the lateral hypothalamic area they were initially recognized as regulators of feeding behavior but they are mainly regarded as key modulators of the sleep wakefulness cycle orexins activate orexin neurons monoaminergic and cholinergic neurons in the hypothalamus brainstem regions to maintain a long consolidated awake period anatomical studies of neural projections from to orexin neurons and phenotypic characterization of transgenic mice revealed various roles for orexin neurons in the coordination of emotion energy homeostasis reward system and arousal for example orexin neurons are regulated by peripheral metabolic cues including ghrelin leptin and glucose concentration this suggests that they may provide a link between energy homeostasis and arousal states link between the limbic system and orexin neurons might be important for increasing vigilance during emotional stimuli orexins are also involved in reward systems and the mechanisms of drug addiction these findings suggest that orexin neurons sense the outer and inner environment of the body and maintain the proper wakefulness level of animals for survival this review discusses the mechanism by which orexins maintain sleep wakefulness states and how this mechanism relates to other systems that regulate emotion reward and energy homeostasis
Sleep_Wakefulness	controlling sleep wakefulness using optogenetics optogenetics is a recently developed experimental technique to control the activity of neurons using light optogenetics shows its power to reveal the physiological role of specific neural circuits in the brain in particular manipulation of a specific type of neurons using optogenetics with high accuracy timing enables us to analyze causality between neural activity and initiation of animal behaviors however to manipulate the activity of specific neurons in vivo there are two critical steps to succeed in manipulation of the neural activity and control of the behavior of individual animals the first step is an adequate number of molecules of light activated protein that has to be expressed in the cell membrane of the neurons of interest the second step is the optical system to illuminate the targeted neurons with enough intensity of light to activate the light activated protein we applied optogenetics to hypothalamic peptidergic neurons such as orexin hypocretin neurons or melanin concentrating hormone neurons these neurons are implicated in sleep wakefulness regulation in this mini review will show the regulatory mechanism of sleep wakefulness by these neurons using optogenetics
Sleep_Wakefulness	regulation of the phases of the sleep wakefulness cycle with histamine distributed neural networks in the brain sustain generation of wakefulness and two sleep states non sleep and sleep these three behavioral states are jointly ingrained in a rhythmic sequence that constitutes the sleep wakefulness cycle this paper reviews and updates knowledge about the involvement of the histaminergic system in sleep wakefulness cycle organization histaminergic neurons are exclusively located in the hypothalamic tuberomammillary nucleus but are the source of a widespread projection system to many brain regions histamine neurons are active during waking especially with high attention need and remain silent in both non and sleep there have been described four metabotropic histamine receptors of which and are present in the nervous system and are mainly postsynaptic heteroreceptors whereas is thought to be mostly a presynaptic auto and hetero receptor histaminergic neurons are excited by hypocretinergic neurons and most of the arousing hypocretin effects are thought to depend on histaminergic actions interactions among histaminergic axons and cholinergic nuclei within forebrain and brainstem are particularly important for cortical activation in contrast histaminergic tuberomammillary neurons similarly to other aminergic neurons in locus coeruleus or dorsal raphe nucleus are inhibited by non sleep promoting neurons of the preoptic region further inhibitory actions on histamine neurons come from adenosine release on tuberomammillary region finally histaminergic neurons inhibit on hypothalamic neurons containing melanine concentrating hormone thus supporting a permissive role of tuberomammillary nucleus in sleep actually knockout mice for histidine decarboxylase the enzyme synthetizing histamine show a significant sleep increase

Sustained_Threat	attention to threat in posttraumatic stress disorder as indexed by eye tracking indices a systematic review cognitive models of posttraumatic stress disorder implicate threat related attentional biases in the etiology and phenomenology of the disorder however extant attentional research using reaction time based paradigms and measures has yielded mixed results eye tracking methodology has emerged in recent years to overcome several inherent drawbacks of based tasks striving to better delineate attentional processes systematic review of experimental studies examining threat related attention biases in using eye tracking methodology and group comparison designs was conducted conforming to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses guidelines studies were selected following a systematic search for publications between num and december num in psycinfo and the national center for research s published international literature on traumatic stress database additional records were identified by employing the similar articles feature in pubmed and the cited reference search in web of science reference sections of review articles book chapters and studies selected for inclusion were searched for further studies ongoing studies were also sought through clinicaltrials gov total of num studies n num participants in total were included in the final review results indicated little support for enhanced threat detection hypervigilance and attentional avoidance however consistent evidence emerged for sustained attention on threat i e attention maintenance in this review is the first to systematically evaluate extant findings in emanating from eye tracking studies employing group comparison designs results suggest that sustained attention on threat might serve as a potential target for therapeutic intervention
Sustained_Threat	phasic and sustained brain responses in the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis during threat anticipation several lines of evidence suggest that the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis are differentially involved in phasic and sustained fear even though results from neuroimaging studies support this distinction a specific effect of a temporal dissociation with phasic responses to onset versus sustained responses during prolonged states of threat anticipation has not been shown yet to explore this issue we investigated brain activation during anticipation of threat in num healthy participants by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging participants were presented different visual cues indicated the temporally unpredictable occurrence of a subsequent aversive or neutral stimulus during the onset of aversive versus neutral anticipatory cues results showed a differential phasic activation of amygdala anterior cingulate cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in contrast activation in the and other brain regions including insula dorsolateral cuneus posterior cingulate cortex and periaqueductal grey was characterized by a sustained response during the threat versus neutral anticipation period analyses of functional connectivity showed phasic amygdala response as positively associated with activation mainly in sensory cortex areas whereas sustained activation was negatively associated with activation in visual cortex and positively correlated with activation in the insula and thalamus these findings suggest that the amygdala is responsive to the onset of cues signaling the unpredictable occurrence of a potential threat while the in concert with other areas is involved in sustained anxiety furthermore the amygdala and are characterized by distinctive connectivity patterns during threat anticipation
Sustained_Threat	exaggerated neurobiological sensitivity to threat as a mechanism linking anxiety with increased risk for diseases of aging anxiety disorders increase risk for the early development of several diseases of aging elevated inflammation a common risk factor across diseases of aging may play a key role in the relationship between anxiety and physical disease however the neurobiological mechanisms linking anxiety with elevated inflammation remain unclear in this review we present a neurobiological model of the mechanisms by which anxiety promotes inflammation specifically we propose that exaggerated neurobiological sensitivity to threat in anxious individuals may lead to sustained threat perception which is accompanied by prolonged activation of threat related neural circuitry and threat responsive biological systems including the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis autonomic nervous system and inflammatory response over time this pattern of responding can promote chronic inflammation through structural and functional brain changes altered sensitivity of immune cell receptors dysregulation of the axis and and accelerated cellular aging chronic inflammation in turn increases risk for diseases of aging exaggerated neurobiological sensitivity to threat may thus be a treatment target for reducing disease risk in anxious individuals
Sustained_Threat	vigilance for threat interacts with amygdala responses to subliminal threat cues in specific phobia the amygdala has been strongly implicated in the processing of threat relevant information in specific phobia however there is an ongoing debate as to whether the amygdala may also be engaged outside of conscious stimulus awareness furthermore considering that sustained vigilance for threat constitutes a crucial characteristic of specific phobias we hypothesized a possible role of this symptom in modulating amygdala sensitivity to disorder relevant cues using event related functional magnetic resonance imaging we examined responses of the amygdala to subliminal and supraliminal phobogenic stimuli in spider phobic subjects and whether these responses might be specifically associated with disorder related hypervigilance eighteen female spider phobic subjects and num healthy female control subjects were exposed to pictures of spiders and phobia irrelevant objects presented briefly during two backward masking conditions used to manipulate stimulus awareness brain activation data were analyzed as a function of subjects perceptual performance on each single trial and were tested for correlations with different components of the phobic symptomatology such as vigilance as assessed by self report scales compared with control subjects phobic participants showed stronger responses of both amygdalae to consciously perceived spiders versus nonspider targets whereas during unconscious stimulus processing enhanced activation was only apparent in the right amygdala moreover the intensity of disorder related vigilance was positively correlated with right amygdala activation specifically during the subliminal condition these findings provide evidence for unconscious threat processing in specific phobia with the magnitude of amygdala responses specifically potentiated by sustained hypervigilance for threat aberrations in this vigilance system may be critically involved in anxiety disorders
Sustained_Threat	distinct associations between low positive affect panic and neural responses to reward and threat during late stages of affective picture processing abnormal patterns of attention to threat and reward have been proposed as potential mechanisms of dysfunction in anxiety and mood disorders however research on this topic has been inconsistent perhaps because of both clinical heterogeneity in the samples assessed and measurement of attentional biases that is temporally imprecise the present study measured transdiagnostic symptoms of anxiety and depression in num young adults and recorded affect modulated event related potentials in response to task irrelevant pictures in a speeded response task low positive affect was uniquely associated with reduced modulation of later event related potentials i e the and the late positive potential by rewarding images suggesting deficits in sustained attention to reward low positive affect was also associated with a blunted threat elicited late positive potential symptoms of panic were associated with an increased to rewarding images as well as an increased late positive potential to all picture types these data suggest that dysfunction in neural markers of sustained attention to threat and reward relate in specific ways to transdiagnostic symptom dimensions of anxiety and depression moreover event related potentials are likely to be useful in investigations of the time course of attentional abnormalities associated with these symptom dimensions
Sustained_Threat	extended amygdala connectivity changes during sustained shock anticipation the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and central amygdala cea of the extended amygdala are small anatomically interconnected brain regions they are thought to mediate responses to sustained unpredictable threat stimuli and phasic predictable threat stimuli respectively they perform these operations largely through their interconnected networks in two previous studies we mapped and contrasted the resting functional connectivity networks of the and cea at num tesla with high resolution this follow up study investigates the changes in functional connectivity of these structures during sustained anticipation of electric shock results show that the and cea become less strongly coupled with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex vmpfc cingulate and nucleus accumbens in shock threat relative to a safety condition in addition the cea becomes more strongly coupled with the thalamus under threat an exploratory whole brain connectivity analysis reveals that although the cea exhibits generally decreased connectivity many other cortical regions demonstrate greater coupling under threat than safety understanding the differential network structures of these two regions and how they contribute to processing under threat will help elucidate the building blocks of the anxious state
Sustained_Threat	commonalities and differences in the neural substrates of threat predictability in panic disorder and specific phobia different degrees of threat predictability are thought to induce either phasic fear or sustained anxiety maladaptive sustained anxious apprehension is thought to result in overgeneralization of anxiety and thereby to contribute to the development of anxiety disorders therefore differences in threat predictability have been associated with pathological states of anxiety with specific phobia representing phasic fear as heightened response to predictable threat while panic disorder is characterized by sustained anxiety unpredictable threat and as a consequence overgeneralization of fear the present study aimed to delineate commonalities and differences in the neural substrates of the impact of threat predictability on affective processing in these two anxiety disorders twenty patients num patients and num non anxious control subjects were investigated with an adapted design no predictable unpredictable threat using whole head magnetoencephalography group independent neural activity in the right dlpfc increased with decreasing threat predictability patients showed a sustained hyperactivation of the vmpfc under threat and safety conditions the magnitude of hyperactivation was inversely correlated with pds subjective arousal and anxiety sensitivity both and patients revealed decreased parietal processing of affective stimuli findings indicate overgeneralization between threat and safety conditions and increased need for emotion regulation via the vmpfc in but not patients both anxiety disorders showed decreased activation in parietal networks possibly indicating attentional avoidance of affective stimuli present results complement findings from fear conditioning studies and underline overgeneralization of fear particularly in

Sustained_Threat	healthy individuals maintain adaptive stimulus evaluation under predictable and unpredictable threat the anxiety inducing paradigms such as the threat of shock paradigm have provided ample data on the emotional processing of predictable and unpredictable threat but little is known about the processing of aversive threat irrelevant stimuli in these paradigms we investigated how the predictability of threat influences the neural visual processing of threat irrelevant fearful and neutral faces thirty two healthy individuals participated in an threat test consisting of a safe or neutral condition and a predictable as well as an unpredictable threat condition using audio visual threat stimuli in all conditions we registered participants brain responses to threat irrelevant faces via magnetoencephalography the data showed that increasing unpredictability of threat evoked increasing emotion regulation during face processing predominantly in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex regions during an early to mid latency time interval importantly we obtained only main effects but no significant interaction of facial expression and conditions of different threat predictability neither in behavioral nor in neural data healthy individuals with average trait anxiety are thus able to maintain adaptive stimulus evaluation processes under predictable and unpredictable threat conditions

Sustained_Threat	discovering networks altered by potential threat anxiety using quadratic discriminant analysis researchers have only recently begun using functional neuroimaging to explore the human response to periods of sustained anxious anticipation namely potential threat here we investigated brain responses acquired with functional during an instructed threat of shock paradigm used to create sustained periods of aversive anticipation in this re analysis of previously published data we employed quadratic discriminant analysis to classify the multivariate pattern of whole brain functional connectivity and to identify connectivity changes during periods of potential threat our method identifies clusters with altered connectivity on a voxelwise basis thus eschewing the need to define regions a priori classifier generalization was evaluated by testing on data from participants not used during training robust classification between threat and safe contexts was possible and inspection of diagnostic features revealed altered functional connectivity involving the intraparietal sulcus task negative regions striatum and anterior cingulate cortex we anticipate that the proposed method will prove useful to experimenters wishing to identify large scale functional networks that distinguish between experimental conditions or groups
Sustained_Threat	initial and sustained brain responses to threat anticipation in blood injection injury phobia blood injection injury phobia differs from other subtypes of specific phobia in that it is associated with elevated disgust sensitivity as well as specific autonomic and brain responses during processing of phobia relevant stimuli to what extent these features play a role already during threat anticipation is unclear in the current fmri experiment num female phobics and num female healthy controls anticipated the presentation of phobia specific and neutral pictures on the behavioral level anxiety dominated the anticipatory period in phobics relative to controls while both anxiety and disgust were elevated during picture presentation by applying two different models for the analysis of brain responses to anticipation of phobia specific versus neutral stimuli we found initial and sustained increases of activation in anterior cingulate cortex insula lateral and medial prefrontal cortex thalamus and visual areas as well as initial activation in the amygdala for phobics as compared to healthy controls these results suggest that phobia is characterized by activation of a typical neural defense network during threat anticipation with anxiety as the predominant emotion
Sustained_Threat	additive effects of threat of shock and picture valence on startle reflex modulation the present study examined the effects of sustained anticipatory anxiety on the affective modulation of the eyeblink startle reflex towards this end pleasant neutral and unpleasant pictures were presented as a continuous stream during alternating threat of shock and safety periods which were cued by colored picture frames orbicularis to auditory startle probes and electrodermal activity were recorded previous findings regarding affective picture valence and threat of shock modulation were replicated of main interest anticipating aversive events and viewing affective pictures additively modulated defensive activation specifically despite overall potentiated startle blink magnitude in threat of shock conditions the startle reflex remained sensitive to hedonic picture valence finally skin conductance level revealed sustained sympathetic activation throughout the entire experiment during threat compared to safety periods overall defensive activation by physical threat appears to operate independently from reflex modulation by picture media the present data confirms the importance of simultaneously manipulating phasic fear and sustained anxiety in studying both normal and abnormal anxiety

Acute_Threat_Fear	the ventromedial hypothalamus mediates predator fear memory the amygdala has been shown to be essential for the processing of acute and learned fear across animal species however the downstream neural circuits that mediate these fear responses differ according to the nature of the threat with separate pathways having been identified for predator conspecific and physically harmful threats in particular the dorsomedial part of the ventromedial hypothalamus vhmdm is critical for the expression of defensive responses to predators here we tested the hypothesis that this circuit also participates in predator fear memory by transient pharmacogenetic inhibition of the vmhdm and its downstream effector the dorsal periaqueductal grey during predator fear learning in the mouse our data demonstrate that neural activity in the vmhdm is required for both the acquisition and recall of predator fear memory whereas that of its downstream effector the dorsal periaqueductal grey is required only for the acute expression of fear these findings are consistent with a role for the medial hypothalamus in encoding an internal emotional state of fear
Acute_Threat_Fear	dynorphin stress and depression stress is most often associated with aversive states it rapidly induces the release of hormones and neuropeptides including dynorphin which activates kappa opioid receptors kors in the central and peripheral nervous systems in animal models many aversive effects of stress are mimicked or exacerbated by stimulation of kors in limbic brain regions although signaling during acute stress may increase physical ability by producing analgesia and motivation to escape a threat by producing aversion prolonged signaling in response to chronic or uncontrollable stress can lead to persistent expression of behavioral signs that are characteristic of human depressive disorders i e prodepressive like signs accumulating evidence suggests that kors contribute to the progressive amplification sensitization of stress induced behaviors that occurs with repeated exposure to stress many of the aversive effects of stress are blocked by antagonists suggesting that these agents may have potential as therapeutics for stress related conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders this review summarizes current data on how systems contribute to the acute rapid delayed and cumulative molecular and behavioral effects of stress we focus on behavioral paradigms that provide insight on interactions between stress and function within each of these temporal categories using a simplified model we consider the time course and mechanism of mediated effects in stress and suggest future directions that may be useful in determining whether antagonists exert their therapeutic effects by preventing the development of stress induced behaviors the expression of stress induced behaviors or both
Acute_Threat_Fear	panic disorder with agoraphobia from a behavioral neuroscience perspective applying the research principles formulated by the research domain criteria rdoc initiative in the current review we reconceptualize a categorical diagnosis panic disorder and agoraphobia in terms of two constructs within the domain negative valence systems suggested by the research domain criteria initiative panic attacks are considered as abrupt and intense fear responses to acute threat arising from inside the body while anxious apprehension refers to anxiety responses to potential harm and more distant or uncertain threat taking a dimensional view panic disorder with agoraphobia is defined with the threat imminence model stating that defensive responses are dynamically organized along the dimension of the proximity of the threat we tested this model within a large group of patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia num and num in a replication sample and found evidence that panic attacks are indeed instances of circa strike defense this component of the defensive reactivity was related to genetic modulators within the serotonergic system in contrast anxious apprehension characterized by attentive freezing during postencounter defense was related to general distress and depressive mood as well as to genetic modulations within the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis patients with a strong behavioral tendency for active and passive avoidance responded better to exposure treatment if the therapist guides the patient through the exposure exercises
Acute_Threat_Fear	flexible attention deployment in threatening contexts an instructed fear conditioning study factors leading humans to shift attention away from danger cues remain poorly understood two laboratory experiments reported here show that context interacts with learning experiences to shape attention avoidance of mild danger cues the first experiment exposed num participants to contextual threat of electric shock attention allocation to mild danger cues was then assessed with the dot probe task results showed that contextual threat caused subjects to avert attention from danger cues in the second experiment num participants were conditioned to the same contextual threat used in experiment num these subjects then were randomly assigned to either an experimental group trained to shift attention toward danger cues or a placebo group exposed to the same stimuli without the training component as in experiment num contextual threat again caused attention allocation away from danger in the control group however this did not occur in the experimental group these experiments show that acute contextual threat and learning experiences interact to shape the deployment of attention away from danger cues
Acute_Threat_Fear	effects of alcohol on brain responses to social signals of threat in humans alcohol is a known exogenous modulator of negative affect anxiety tension in both animals and humans it has been proposed that the anxiolytic effects of alcohol are mediated via the amygdala an area critical to fear perception and responding however little is known about the acute effects of alcohol on amygdala reactivity to threatening information in humans we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a validated task to probe amygdala responses to social signals of threat in num healthy social drinkers after a double blind crossover administration of alcohol or placebo we found that alcohol significantly reduced amygdala reactivity to threat signals the current findings fit well with the notion that alcohol may attenuate threat based responding and provide a potential brain based mechanism for the link between alcohol and anxiety and or social threat perception
Acute_Threat_Fear	single dose of citalopram increases fear recognition in healthy subjects we have previously shown that a single dose of intravenous citalopram in healthy volunteers enhances the detection of fearful facial expressions suggesting an effect of acute selective serotonin re uptake inhibitor treatment on the processing of anxiety related stimuli the aim of the present study was to confirm and extend this finding by studying the effects of a single dose of oral citalopram on a range of tasks designed to assess different aspects of emotional processing total of num healthy volunteers were randomly allocated to double blind treatment with either citalopram num mg orally or placebo participants then completed a series of tasks assessing emotional aspects of attention visual probe task perception categorization of facial affect memory emotional memory task and reactivity to threat emotion potentiated startle relative to placebo treated subjects participants treated with citalopram demonstrated improved recognition of fearful faces and increased baseline startle response however the citalopram group also showed an attentional bias towards positive words our data suggest that acute oral citalopram increases the processing of anxiety related stimuli in healthy volunteers this mechanism could underlie the known tendency of ssris to increase anxiety in patients early in treatment our data also suggests that some of the positive biases in emotional processing produced by treatment might be detectable at the beginning of treatment

Acute_Threat_Fear	amygdala reactivity and anterior cingulate habituation predict posttraumatic stress disorder symptom maintenance after acute civilian trauma studies suggest that exaggerated amygdala reactivity is a vulnerability factor for posttraumatic stress disorder however our understanding is limited by a paucity of prospective longitudinal studies recent studies in healthy samples indicate that relative to reactivity habituation is a more reliable biomarker of individual differences in amygdala function we investigated reactivity of the amygdala and cortical areas to repeated threat presentations in a prospective study of participants were recruited from the emergency department of a large level trauma center within num hours of trauma symptoms were assessed at baseline and approximately num num num and num months after trauma growth curve modeling was used to estimate symptom recovery trajectories thirty one individuals participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging around the num month assessment passively viewing fearful and neutral face stimuli reactivity fearful neutral and habituation to fearful faces was examined amygdala reactivity but not habituation num to num weeks after trauma was positively associated with the symptom intercept and predicted symptoms at num months after trauma habituation in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex was positively associated with the slope of symptoms such that decreases in ventral anterior cingulate cortex activation over repeated presentations of fearful stimuli predicted increasing symptoms findings point to neural signatures of risk for maintaining symptoms after trauma exposure specifically chronic symptoms were predicted by amygdala hyperreactivity and poor recovery was predicted by a failure to maintain ventral anterior cingulate cortex activation in response to fearful stimuli the importance of identifying patients at risk after trauma exposure is discussed
Acute_Threat_Fear	cross species study of heterogeneity in fear extinction learning in relation to variation and expression implications for the acute treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder deficits in fear extinction learning are hypothesized to underlie the development of posttraumatic stress disorder such deficits may in part be due to genetic and epigenetic variation in the stress related gene conversely altering epigenetic responses during memory consolidation may rescue extinction deficits making it a target for acute intervention to prevent the development of study num humans examines if single nucleotide polymorphisms snps and symptom domains re experiencing avoidance numbing hyperarousal are associated with abnormal fear extinction phenotypes identified using latent growth mixture modeling study num mice tests if increasing doses of dexamethasone administered prior to extinction alters fkbp mrna production in the amygdala after extinction and recall and prevents the development of abnormal extinction phenotypes in humans abnormal extinction was associated with the homozygous genotype of snps and and hyperarousal symptoms in mice dexamethasone num mug kg was associated with increased amygdala fkbp mrna following extinction and robust extinction learning while lower doses were not associated with amygdala fkbp mrna or differences in extinction learning further mice that extinguished on dexamethasone num mug kg maintained low levels of freezing behavior during recall training while mrna levels were no longer elevated together findings indicate that confers risk for fear extinction deficits however this risk may be ameliorated by increasing fkbp mrna expression in the amygdala during memory consolidation making this mechanism a plausible point of acute intervention to prevent the development of
Acute_Threat_Fear	neural mechanisms underlying num related sensitivity to acute stress many studies have shown that num genotype interacts with exposure to stress in conferring risk for psychopathology however the specific neural mechanisms through which this gene by environment interaction confers risk remain largely unknown and no study to date has directly examined the modulatory effects of num on corticolimbic circuit responses during exposure to acute stress an acute laboratory stressor was administered to num healthy women during blood oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging in this task participants were threatened with electric shocks of uncertain intensity which were unpredictably delivered to the wrist after a long anticipatory cue period of unpredictable duration relative to women carrying the allele those with the genotype showed enhanced activation during threat anticipation in a network of regions including the amygdala hippocampus anterior insula thalamus pulvinar caudate precuneus anterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex individuals with the genotype also displayed enhanced positive coupling between medial prefrontal cortex activation and anxiety experience whereas enhanced negative coupling between insula activation and perceived success at regulating anxiety was observed in individuals carrying the allele these findings suggest that during stress exposure neural systems that enhance fear and arousal modulate attention toward threat and perseverate on emotional salience of the threat may be engaged preferentially in individuals with the genotype this may be one mechanism underlying the risk for psychopathology conferred by the allele upon exposure to life stressors
Acute_Threat_Fear	acute hydrocortisone treatment increases anxiety but not fear in healthy volunteers a fear potentiated startle study the debilitating effects of chronic glucocorticoids excess are well known but comparatively little is understood about the role of acute cortisol indirect evidence in rodents suggests that acute cortisone could selectively increase some forms of long duration aversive states such as anxiety but not relatively similar briefer aversive states such as fear however no prior experimental studies in humans consider the unique effects of cortisol on anxiety and fear using well validated methods for eliciting these two similar but dissociable aversive states the current study examines these effects as instantiated with short and long duration threats healthy volunteers n num received placebo or a low num mg or a high num mg dose of hydrocortisone in a double blind crossover design subjects were exposed repeatedly to three num sec duration conditions no shock predictable shocks in which shocks were signaled by a short duration threat cue and unpredictable shocks aversive states were indexed by acoustic startle fear was operationally defined as the increase in startle reactivity during the threat cue in the predictable condition fear potentiated startle anxiety was operationally defined as the increase in baseline startle from the no shock to the two threat conditions anxiety potentiated startle hydrocortisone affected neither baseline nor short duration fear potentiated startle but increased long duration anxiety potentiated startle these results suggest that hydrocortisone administration in humans selectively increases anxiety but not fear possible mechanisms implicated are discussed in light of prior data in rodents specifically hydrocortisone might increase anxiety via sensitization of corticotrophin releasing hormones in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis
Acute_Threat_Fear	psychoneurometric operationalization of threat sensitivity relations with clinical symptom and physiological response criteria the national institute of mental health s research domain criteria rdoc initiative calls for the incorporation of neurobiological approaches and findings into conceptions of mental health problems through a focus on biobehavioral constructs investigated across multiple domains of measurement units of analysis although the constructs in the rdoc system are characterized in process terms i e as functional concepts with brain and behavioral referents these constructs can also be framed as dispositions i e as dimensions of variation in biobehavioral functioning across individuals focusing on one key rdoc construct acute threat or fear the current article illustrates a construct oriented psychoneurometric strategy for operationalizing this construct in individual difference terms as threat sensitivity utilizing data from num adult participants we demonstrate empirically that a a scale measure of designed to tap general fear fearlessness predicts effectively to relevant clinical problems i e fear disorder symptoms b this scale measure shows reliable associations with physiological indices of acute reactivity to aversive visual stimuli and c a cross domain factor reflecting the intersection of scale and physiological indicators of predicts effectively to both clinical and neurophysiological criterion measures results illustrate how the psychoneurometric approach can be used to create a dimensional index of a biobehavioral trait construct in this case which can serve as a bridge between phenomena in domains of psychopathology and neurobiology implications and future directions are discussed with reference to the rdoc initiative and existing report based conceptions of psychological traits
Arousal	sadness and happiness are amplified in solitary listening to music previous studies have shown that music is a powerful means to convey affective states but it remains unclear whether and how social context shape the intensity and quality of emotions perceived in music using a within subject design we studied this question in two experimental settings i e when subjects were alone versus in company of others without direct social interaction or feedback non vocal musical excerpts of the emotional qualities happiness or sadness were rated on arousal and valence dimensions we found evidence for an amplification of perceived emotion in the solitary listening condition i e happy music was rated as happier and more arousing when nobody else was around and in an analogous manner sad music was perceived as sadder this difference might be explained by a shift of attention in the presence of others the observed interaction of perceived emotion and social context did not differ for stimuli of different cultural origin

Arousal	does my pain affect your disgust cross modal influence of first hand aversive experiences in the appraisal of others facial expressions embodied models of social cognition argue that others affective states are processed by re enacting a sensory specific representation of the same state in the observer however neuroimaging studies suggest that a reliable part of the representation shared between self and others is supramodal and relates to dimensions such as unpleasantness or arousal common to qualitatively different experiences here we investigated whether representations of first hand pain and disgust influenced the subsequent evaluation of facial expressions in modality specific fashion or in terms of unpleasantness or arousal thirty volunteers were subjected to thermal painful and olfactory disgusting events and subsequently were asked to classify computer generated faces expressing pain characterized by high unpleasantness and arousal disgust high unpleasantness and low arousal surprise low unpleasantness and high arousal and hybrid combinations thereof thermal and olfactory events were associated with comparable unpleasantness ratings and heart rate but stronger galvanic response was found for painful temperatures furthermore we found that the appraisal of facial expressions was biased by the prior stimulus with more frequent pain classifications following thermal stimuli and more frequent disgust classifications following olfactory stimuli critically this modulation was cross modal in nature as each first hand stimulation influenced in comparable fashion facial traits diagnostic of both pain and disgust without instead generalizing to features of surprise overall these data support the presence of shared coding between one s aversive experiences and the appraisal of others facial responses which is best describable as supramodal representation of the unpleasantness of the experience these results extend previous findings about common representational coding between the experience of first hand and others pain in particular they highlight that reliable part of the information shared is supramodal in nature and relates to a broad dimension of unpleasantness common also to painless aversive states such as disgust

Arousal	experience sampling methodology reveals similarities in the experience of passage of time in young and elderly adults many people accept the idea that time seems to pass more quickly as they get older as if this is a psychological reality however systematic investigations of differences in judgments of passage of time between young and elderly people are very rare and contradictory the present study examined the experience of passage of time in daily life in young and elderly people using experience sampling methodology with num alerts per day for num days being delivered by smartphones at each alert a short questionnaire was filled in asking questions about passage of present time affective state arousal level and attention to current activities among others our study found no difference between the young and the old participants in the judgment of passage of present time irrespective of the participants age the experience of passage of time in every day life was significantly related to affective states and current activities when they captured attention
Arousal	limited time perspective increases the value of calm previous findings indirectly suggest that the more people perceive their time in life as limited the more they value calm no study however has directly tested this hypothesis to this end using a combination of survey experience sampling and experimental methods we examined the relationship between future time perspective and the affective states that people ideally want to feel i e their ideal affect in study num the more people reported a limited time perspective the more they wanted to feel calm and experience other low arousal positive states in study num participants were randomly assigned to a limited time or an expanded time condition participants in the limited time condition reported valuing calm and other low arousal positive states more than those in the expanded time condition we discuss the implications of these findings for broadening our understanding of the factors that shape how people ideally want to feel and their consequences for decision making
Arousal	inferring affect from fmri data neuroimaging findings are often interpreted in terms of affective experience but researchers disagree about the advisability or even possibility of such inferences and few frameworks explicitly link these levels of analysis here we suggest that the spatial and temporal resolution of functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri data could support inferences about affective states specifically we propose that fmri nucleus accumbens nacc activity is associated with positive arousal whereas a combination of anterior insula activity and nacc activity is associated with negative arousal this framework implies quantifiable and testable inferences about affect from fmri data which may ultimately inform predictions about approach and avoidance behavior we consider potential limits on neurally inferred affect before highlighting theoretical and practical benefits
Arousal	interactive effects of trait and state affect on top down control of attention few studies have investigated how attentional control is affected by transient affective states while taking individual differences in affective traits into consideration in this study participants completed a color word stroop task immediately after undergoing a positive neutral or negative affective context manipulation behavioral performance was unaffected by any considered in isolation for individuals high in trait negative affect performance was impaired by the negative but not the positive or neutral neuroimaging results indicate that activity in primarily top down control regions of the brain inferior frontal gyrus and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex was suppressed in the presence of emotional arousal both negative and positive acms this effect appears to have been exacerbated or offset by co occurring activity in other top down control regions parietal and emotion processing regions orbitofrontal cortex amygdala and nucleus accumbens as a function of the valence of state affect positive or negative and trait affect trait or trait neuroimaging results are consistent with behavioral findings in combination they indicate both additive and interactive influences of trait and state affect on top down control of attention
Arousal	the affective norms for polish short texts database properties and impact of participants population and sex on affective ratings the affective norms for polish short texts dataset imbir d is a list of num affective sentence stimuli with known affective properties with respect to subjectively perceived valence arousal dominance origin subjective significance and source this article examines the reliability of the and the impact of population type and sex on affective ratings the dataset was introduced to provide a recognized method of eliciting affective states with linguistic stimuli more complex than single words and that included contextual information and thus are less ambiguous in interpretation than single word analysis of the properties of the dataset showed that norms collected are reliable in terms of split half estimation and that the distributions of ratings are similar to those obtained in other affective norms studies the pattern of correlations was the same as that found in analysis of an affective norms dataset for words based on the same six variables female psychology students valence ratings were also more polarized than those of their female student peers studying other subjects but arousal ratings were only higher for negative words differences also appeared for all other measured dimensions women s valence ratings were found to be more polarized and arousal ratings were higher than those made by men and differences were also present for dominance origin and subjective significance the is the first polish language list of sentence stimuli and could easily be adapted for other languages and cultures
Arousal	modelling audiovisual integration of affect from videos and music two experiments examined how affective values from visual and auditory modalities are integrated experiment num paired music and videos drawn from three levels of valence while holding arousal constant experiment num included a parallel combination of three levels of arousal while holding valence constant in each experiment participants rated their affective states after unimodal and multimodal presentations experiment num revealed a congruency effect in which stimulus combinations of the same extreme valence resulted in more extreme state ratings than component stimuli presented in isolation an interaction between music and video valence reflected the greater influence of negative affect video valence was found to have a significantly greater effect on combined ratings than music valence the pattern of data was explained by a five parameter differential weight averaging model that attributed greater weight to the visual modality and increased weight with decreasing values of valence experiment num revealed a congruency effect only for high arousal combinations and no interaction effects this pattern was explained by a three parameter constant weight averaging model with greater weight for the auditory modality and a very low arousal value for the initial state these results demonstrate key differences in audiovisual integration between valence and arousal
Arousal	increased heart rate after exercise facilitates the processing of fearful but not disgusted faces embodied theories of emotion assume that emotional processing is grounded in bodily and affective processes accordingly the perception of an emotion re enacts congruent sensory and affective states and conversely bodily states congruent with a specific emotion facilitate emotional processing this study tests whether the ability to process facial expressions faces having a neutral expression expressing fear or disgust can be influenced by making the participants body state congruent with the expressed emotion e g high heart rate in the case of faces expressing fear we designed a task requiring participants to categorize pictures of male and female faces that either had a neutral expression neutral or expressed emotions whose linkage with high heart rate is strong fear or significantly weaker or absent disgust critically participants were tested in two conditions with experimentally induced high heart rate exercise and with normal heart rate normal participants processed fearful faces but not disgusted or neutral faces faster when they were in the exercise condition than in the normal condition these results support the idea that an emotionally congruent body state facilitates the automatic processing of emotionally charged stimuli and this effect is emotion specific rather than due to generic factors such as arousal
Arousal	psychophysiological response patterns to affective film stimuli psychophysiological research on emotion utilizes various physiological response measures to index activation of the defense system here we tested num whether acoustic startle reflex skin conductance response and heart rate elicited by highly arousing stimuli specifically reflect a defensive state and num the relation between resting heart rate variability and affective responding in a within subject design participants viewed film clips with a positive negative and neutral content in contrast to and we show that differentiated between negative neutral and positive states and can therefore be considered as a reliable index of activation of the defense system furthermore resting was associated with affect modulated characteristics of but not with or interestingly individuals with low showed less differentiation in between affective states we discuss the important value of in psychophysiological research on emotion and speculate on as a potential biological marker for demarcating adaptive from maladaptive responding
Arousal	respiration metabolic balance and attention in affective picture processing the respiratory behavior during affective states is not completely understood we studied breathing pattern responses to picture series in num participants we also measured end tidal pco etco to determine if ventilation is in balance with metabolic demands and spontaneous eye blinking to investigate the link between respiration and attention minute ventilation and inspiratory drive increased with self rated arousal these relationships reflected increases in inspiratory volume rather than shortening of the time parameters etco covaried with pleasantness but not arousal eye blink rate decreased with increasing unpleasantness in line with a negativity bias in attention this study confirms that respiratory responses to affective stimuli are organized to a certain degree along the dimensions of valence and arousal it shows for the first time that during picture viewing ventilatory increases with increasing arousal are in balance with metabolic activity and that inspiratory volume is modulated by arousal emerges as the most reliable respiratory index of self perceived arousal
Arousal	genetic moderation of sensitivity to positive and negative affect in marriage hypothesizing that genetic factors partially govern sensitivity to interpersonal cues we examined whether a polymorphism num in the serotonin transporter gene would moderate spouses sensitivity to positive and negative partner affect before and after marital discussions participants from num couples total n num reported their affective states spouses carrying the short allele of the num were more responsive to their partner s preinteraction positive affect and anxiety nervousness compared with spouses with two long alleles these data support the contention that the serotonin system influences affective responses to social stimuli in contrast to the view that the num primarily affects response to adverse experiences these results suggest that this polymorphism moderates sensitivity to positive as well as negative affect
Arousal	the cross mammalian neurophenomenology of primal emotional affects from animal feelings to human therapeutics the neural correlates of human emotions are easy to harvest in contrast the neural constitution of emotional feelings in humans has resisted systematic scientific analysis this review summarizes how preclinical affective neuroscience initiatives are making progress in decoding the neural nature of such feelings in animal brains this has been achieved by studying the rewarding and punishing effects of deep brain stimulation of subcortical emotional networks labeled and systems that evoke distinct emotion action patterns as well as rewarding and punishing effects in animals the implications of this knowledge for development of new psychiatric interventions especially depression are discussed three new antidepressive therapeutics arising from this work are briefly noted num of the medial forebrain bundle in humans num reduction of psychological pain that may arise from excessive arousal and num facilitation of social joy through the study of social play in rats the overall argument is that we may more readily develop new psychiatric interventions through preclinical models if we take animal emotional feelings seriously as opposed to just behavioral changes as targets for development of new treatments
Arousal	high approach and low approach positive affect influence physiological responses to threat and anger positive affect has been related to faster cardiovascular recovery from stress although the family of positive affective states is diverse no study examined whether high approach positive affect e g desire has a different impact on peripheral physiological processes than more frequently studied low approach positive affect e g amusement building upon prior work on emotions and motivation we expected that after controlling for arousal and valence positive affect with higher motivational intensity would facilitate weaker recovery when compared to positive affect with lower motivational intensity across two experiments num for study num num for study num we measured cardiovascular respiratory and electrodermal responses to positive stimuli that differed in approach intensity we measured responses during recovery from stress and during reactivity to threat and anger these studies partially replicated previous findings regarding the soothing function of positive affect e g in respect to diastolic blood pressure recovery and reactivity however we found that high approach and low approach positive affect produced comparable effects in summary these findings suggest that positive valence rather than motivational intensity produces the main soothing effect on peripheral physiology
Arousal	multivariate associations of ideal affect with clinical symptoms prior research has indicated that ideal affect i e the affective states that people value and would ideally like to experience may be relevant to mental health outcomes studies to date however have not used comprehensive multivariate models that account for covariation among facets of ideal affect and incorporate multiple clinical outcomes in the present studies we used structural equation modeling to examine the multivariate effects of ideal affect on symptoms of depression anxiety and alcohol abuse in num moderately large samples of undergraduates num and num exploratory results of study num indicated that valuation of high arousal positive affective states was significantly associated with lower depression symptoms but higher anxiety and alcohol abuse symptoms and that valuation of high arousal negative states was specifically associated with greater anxiety symptoms these results were shown to be structurally invariant across samples and ethnicities in study num which also found that ideal actual affect discrepancies were significantly associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety these findings support and extend the hypothesis that ideal affect is implicated in clinical outcomes by highlighting the importance of jointly considering multiple facets of ideal and actual affect as they relate to a range of clinical syndromes
Arousal	assessment of anxiety in open field and elevated plus maze using infrared thermography due to their direct inaccessibility affective states are classically assessed by gathering concomitant physiological and behavioral measures although such a dual approach to assess emotional states is frequently used in different species including humans the invasiveness of procedures for physiological recordings particularly in smaller sized animals strongly restricts their application we used infrared thermography a non invasive method to assess physiological arousal during open field and elevated plus maze tests in mice by measuring changes in surface temperature indicative of the animals emotional response we aimed to improve the inherently limited and still controversial information provided by behavioral parameters commonly used in these tests our results showed significant and consistent thermal responses during both tests in accordance with classical physiological responses occurring in stressful situations besides we found correlations between these thermal responses and the occurrence of anxiety related behaviors furthermore initial temperatures measured at the start of each procedure open field elevated plus maze which can be interpreted as a measure of the animals initial physiological arousal predicted the levels of activity and of anxiety related behaviors displayed during the tests our results stress the strong link between physiological correlates of emotions and behaviors expressed during unconditioned fear tests
Arousal	affective modulation of the associative limbic subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation in obsessive compulsive disorder affective states underlie daily decision making and pathological behaviours relevant to obsessive compulsive disorders mood disorders and addictions deep brain stimulation targeting the motor and associative limbic subthalamic nucleus has been shown to be effective for parkinson s disease and respectively cognitive and electrophysiological studies in showed responses of the motor to emotional stimuli impairments in recognition of negative affective states and modulation of the intensity of subjective emotion here we studied whether the stimulation of the associative limbic in influences the subjective emotion to low intensity positive and negative images and how this relates to clinical symptoms we assessed num patients with on and off in a double blind randomized manner by recording ratings of valence and arousal to low and high intensity positive and negative emotional images stimulation increased positive ratings and decreased negative ratings to low intensity positive and negative stimuli respectively relative to off stimulation we also show that the change in severity of obsessive compulsive symptoms pre versus post operatively interacts with both and valence ratings we show that stimulation of the associative limbic might influence the negative cognitive bias in and decreasing the negative appraisal of emotional stimuli with a possible relationship with clinical outcomes that the effect is specific to low intensity might suggest a role of uncertainty or conflict related to competing interpretations of image intensity these findings may have implications for the therapeutic efficacy of
Arousal	music and emotions from enchantment to entrainment producing and perceiving music engage a wide range of sensorimotor cognitive and emotional processes emotions are a central feature of the enjoyment of music with a large variety of affective states consistently reported by people while listening to music however besides joy or sadness music often elicits feelings of wonder nostalgia or tenderness which do not correspond to emotion categories typically studied in neuroscience and whose neural substrates remain largely unknown here we review the similarities and differences in the neural substrates underlying these complex music evoked emotions relative to other more basic emotional experiences we suggest that these emotions emerge through a combination of activation in emotional and motivational brain systems e g including reward pathways that confer its valence to music with activation in several other areas outside emotional systems including motor attention or memory related regions we then discuss the neural substrates underlying the entrainment of cognitive and motor processes by music and their relation to affective experience these effects have important implications for the potential therapeutic use of music in neurological or psychiatric diseases particularly those associated with motor attention or affective disturbances
Arousal	toward a psychobiology of posttraumatic self dysregulation reexperiencing hyperarousal dissociation and emotional numbing in this article we propose a psychobiological model that construes fundamentally as a disorder of affect arousal regulation neuroimaging studies of emotion regulation in psychologically healthy populations are initially reviewed as a framework for interpreting the results of previously published investigations of the neural correlates of reexperiencing and dissociation we then apply the emotion regulation framework toward understanding other perturbed affective states in we conclude by discussing the clinical significance of this framework for psychological assessment and treatment of posttrauma psychopathology
Arousal	emotional state and local versus global spatial memory the present work investigated the effects of participant emotional state on global versus local memory for map based information participants were placed into one of four emotion induction groups crossing high and low arousal with positive and negative valence or a control group they then studied a university campus map and completed two memory tests free recall and spatial statement verification converging evidence from these two tasks demonstrated that arousal amplifies symbolic distance effects and leads to a globally focused spatial mental representation partially at the expense of local knowledge these results were found for both positively and negatively valenced affective states the present study is the first investigation of emotional effects on spatial memory and has implications for theories of emotion and spatial cognition
Arousal	in your shoes or mine shifting from other to self perspective is vital for emotional empathy emotional empathy feeling another person s affective states entails simulating how one would feel in the same circumstance prior research has implicated the role of executive controls and shown a link between visuospatial perspective taking and personal disposition of empathy no study has investigated how executive control processes involved in perspective shifting relate to emotional empathy incorporating a spatial perspective taking task in a set switch paradigm we investigated whether swiftly switching from the altercentric to the egocentric perspective is associated with heightened emotional empathy but not with accurate classification of low level perceptual affective cues emotional empathy was measured by subjective ratings of arousal and the similarity of affective states with the target person when viewing photos of a person in an emotionally charged context cognitive empathy was measured by correct recognition of affective cues our results showed that executive controls in perspective shifting related to emotional empathy but not to cognitive empathy emotional empathy correlated negatively with the switch cost from the altercentric to the egocentric perspective and not vice versa faster switching from the altercentric to the egocentric perspective was associated with heightened emotional empathy moreover the processing strategy did not moderate the association flexibility in perspective shifting especially in regaining one s own perspective after taking another person s perspective is critical for emotional empathy to feel another person s affective states one should regain self perspective after walking in the other person s shoes
Circadian_Rhythms	clocks in the clinic circadian rhythms in health and disease circadian rhythms are endogenously generated recurring patterns of around num hours with well established roles in physiology and behaviour these circadian clocks are important in both the aetiology and treatment of various psychiatric and metabolic diseases to maintain physiological homeostasis and optimal functioning living life synchronised to these clocks is desirable modern society however promotes a num num lifestyle where activity often occurs during the body s biological night resulting in mistimed sleep and circadian misalignment this circadian desynchrony can increase the risk of disease and can also influence treatment response clinicians should be aware of the influence that circadian desynchrony can have on health and disease in order to potentially develop new therapeutic strategies and to incorporate chronotherapeutics into current treatment strategies to enhance their utility
Circadian_Rhythms	melatonin and stable circadian rhythms optimize maternal placental and fetal physiology research within the last decade has shown melatonin to have previously unsuspected beneficial actions on the peripheral reproductive organs likewise numerous investigations have documented that stable circadian rhythms are also helpful in maintaining reproductive health the relationship of melatonin and circadian rhythmicity to maternal and fetal health is summarized in this review databases were searched for the related published english literature up to num may num the search terms used in various combinations included melatonin circadian rhythms biological clock suprachiasmatic nucleus ovary pregnancy uterus placenta fetus pre eclampsia intrauterine growth restriction ischemia reperfusion chronodisruption antioxidants oxidative stress and free radicals the results of the studies uncovered are summarized herein both melatonin and circadian rhythms impact reproduction especially during pregnancy melatonin is a multifaceted molecule with direct free radical scavenging and indirect antioxidant activities melatonin is produced in both the ovary and in the placenta where it protects against molecular mutilation and cellular dysfunction arising from oxidative nitrosative stress the placenta in particular is often a site of excessive free radical generation due to less than optimal adhesion to the uterine wall which leads to either persistent hypoxia or intermittent hypoxia and reoxygenation processes that cause massive free radical generation and organ dysfunction this may contribute to pre eclampsia and other disorders which often complicate pregnancy melatonin has ameliorated free radical damage to the placenta and to the fetus in experiments using non human mammals likewise the maintenance of a regular maternal light dark and sleep wake cycle is important to stabilize circadian rhythms generated by the maternal central circadian pacemaker the suprachiasmatic nuclei optimal circadian rhythmicity in the mother is important since her circadian clock either directly or indirectly via the melatonin rhythm programs the developing master oscillator of the fetus experimental studies have shown that disturbed maternal circadian rhythms referred to as chronodisruption and perturbed melatonin cycles have negative consequences for the maturing fetal oscillators which may lead to psychological and behavioral problems in the newborn to optimize regular circadian rhythms and prevent disturbances of the melatonin cycle during pregnancy shift work and bright light exposure at night should be avoided especially during the last trimester of pregnancy finally melatonin synergizes with oxytocin to promote delivery of the fetus since blood melatonin levels are normally highest during the dark period the propensity of childbirth to occur at night may relate to the high levels of melatonin at this time which work in concert with oxytocin to enhance the strength of uterine contractions number of conclusions naturally evolve from the data summarized in this review i melatonin of both pineal and placental origin has essential functions in fetal maturation and placenta uterine homeostasis ii circadian clock genes which are components of all cells including those in the peripheral reproductive organs have important roles in reproductive and organismal fetal and maternal physiology iii due to the potent antioxidant actions of melatonin coupled with its virtual absence of toxicity this indoleamine may have utility in the treatment of pre eclampsia intrauterine growth restriction placental and fetal ischemia reperfusion etc iv the propensity for parturition to occur at night may relate to the synergism between the nocturnal increase in melatonin and oxytocin
Circadian_Rhythms	task related phasing of circadian rhythms in antennal responsiveness to odorants and pheromones in honeybees the insect antennae receive olfactory information from the environment in some insects it has been shown that antennal responsiveness is dynamically regulated by circadian clocks however it is unknown how general this phenomenon is and what functions it serves circadian regulation in honeybee workers is particularly interesting in this regard because they show natural task related chronobiological plasticity forager bees show strong circadian rhythms in behavior and brain gene expression whereas nurse bees tend brood around the clock and have attenuated circadian rhythms in activity and whole brain gene expression here we tested the hypothesis that there is task related plasticity in circadian rhythms of antennal responsiveness to odorants in worker honeybees we used electroantennogram to measure the antennal responsiveness of nurses and foragers to general odorants and pheromones around the day the capacity to track num hz odorant pulses varied with time of day for both task groups but with different phases the antennal pulse tracking capacity was higher during the subjective day for the day active foragers whereas it was better during the night for around the clock active nurses the task related phases of pulse tracking rhythms were similar for all the tested stimuli we also found evidence for circadian rhythms in the response magnitude of foragers but not of nurses to the best of our knowledge these results provide the first evidence for circadian regulation of antennal olfactory responsiveness and odorant pulse tracking capacity in bees or any other hymenopteran insect importantly our study shows for the first time that the circadian phase of olfactory responsiveness may be socially regulated

Circadian_Rhythms	temperature regulates circadian rhythms of immune responses in red swamp crayfish procambarus clarkii as an ectothermic animal crayfish immunity and their resistance to pathogen can be significantly affected by environmental factors such as light and temperature it has been found for a long time that multiple immune parameters of animals and human are circadian regulated by light entrained circadian rhythm whether temperature also affects the immune rhythm of animals still remains unclear in the present study we investigated the effect of temperature cycles on the rhythm of crayfish immunity and their resistance survival experiments demonstrated that temperature cycles of num degrees and num degrees effectively entrained the circadian rhythm of crayfish resistance to aeromonas hydrophila in constant dark after being exposed to temperature cycles the crayfish injected at different time points exhibited significant difference in resistance to hydrophila bacterial growth and total hemocyte count also showed circadian variation in crayfish subjected to temperature cycles but phenoloxidase activity didn t show rhythmic change under the same conditions quantitative real time revealed that basal expression of crustin and astacidin in crayfish subjected to temperature cycles was circadian rhythmic but induced expression by hydrophila didn t show the same rhythm in contrast crayfish maintained at constant temperature showed completely arrhythmic in bacterial resistance immune parameters mentioned above and the expression of antimicrobial peptides the results present here collectively indicated that temperature cycles entrained circadian rhythm of some immune parameters and shaped crayfish resistance to bacteria
Circadian_Rhythms	disruption of behavioral circadian rhythms induced by psychophysiological stress affects plasma free amino acid profiles without affecting peripheral clock gene expression in mice disordered circadian rhythms are associated with various psychiatric conditions and metabolic diseases we recently established a mouse model of a psychophysiological stress induced chronic sleep disorder characterized by reduced amplitude of circadian wheel running activity and sleep wake cycles sleep fragmentation and hyperphagia here we evaluate day night fluctuations in plasma concentrations of free amino acids appetite hormones and prolactin as well as the hepatic expression of circadian clock related genes in mice with mice nocturnal increases in wheel running activity and circadian rhythms of plasma prolactin concentrations were significantly disrupted in mice hyperphagia with a decreased leptin ghrelin ratio was found in mice day night fluctuations in plasma contents were severely disrupted without affecting total levels in mice nocturnal increases in branched chain amino acids such as ile leu and val were further augmented in mice while daytime increases in gly ala ser thr lys arg his tyr met cys glu and asn were significantly attenuated importantly the circadian expression of hepatic clock genes was completely unaffected in mice these findings suggest that circadian clock gene expression does not always reflect disordered behavior and sleep rhythms and that plasma profiles could serve as a potential biomarker of circadian rhythm disorders
Circadian_Rhythms	monitoring circadian rhythms of individual cells in plants the circadian clock is an endogenous timing system based on the self sustained oscillation in individual cells these cellular circadian clocks compose a multicellular circadian system working at respective levels of tissue organ plant body however how numerous cellular clocks are coordinated within a plant has been unclear there was little information about behavior of circadian clocks at a single cell level due to the difficulties in monitoring circadian rhythms of individual cells in an intact plant we developed a single cell bioluminescence imaging system using duckweed as the plant material and succeeded in observing behavior of cellular clocks in intact plants for over a week this imaging technique quantitatively revealed heterogeneous and independent manners of cellular clock behaviors furthermore these quantitative analyses uncovered the local synchronization of cellular circadian rhythms that implied phase attractive interactions between cellular clocks the cell to cell interaction looked to be too weak to coordinate cellular clocks against their heterogeneity under constant conditions on the other hand under light dark conditions the heterogeneity of cellular clocks seemed to be corrected by cell to cell interactions so that cellular clocks showed a clear spatial pattern of phases at a whole plant level thus it was suggested that the interactions between cellular clocks was an adaptive trait working under day night cycles to coordinate cellular clocks in a plant body these findings provide a novel perspective for understanding spatio temporal architectures in the plant circadian system
Circadian_Rhythms	diminished circadian rhythms in hippocampal microglia may contribute to age related neuroinflammatory sensitization aged animals exhibit diminished circadian rhythms and both aging and circadian disruption sensitize neuroinflammatory responses microglia the innate immune cell of the central nervous system possess endogenous timekeeping mechanisms that regulate immune responses here we explored whether aging is associated with disrupted diurnal rhythms in microglia and neuroinflammatory processes first hippocampal microglia isolated from young rats num months rhythmically expressed circadian clock genes whereas microglia isolated from the hippocampus of aged rats num months had aberrant per and per rhythms unstimulated microglia from young rats exhibited robust rhythms of tnfalpha and beta mrna expression whereas those from aged rats had flattened and tonically elevated cytokine expression similarly microglial activation markers were diurnally regulated in the hippocampus of young but not aged rats and diurnal differences in responsiveness to both ex vivo and in vivo inflammatory challenges were abolished in aged rats corticosterone is an entraining signal for extra suprachiasmatic nucleus circadian rhythms here corticosterone stimulation elicited similar per induction in aged and young microglia overall these results indicate that aging dysregulates circadian regulation of neuroinflammatory functions
Circadian_Rhythms	voluntary exercise enhances activity rhythms and ameliorates anxiety and depression like behaviors in the sand rat model of circadian rhythm related mood changes physical exercise is a non pharmacological treatment for affective disorders the mechanisms of its effects are unknown although some suggest a relationship to synchronization of circadian rhythms one way to explore mechanisms is to utilize animal models we previously demonstrated that the diurnal fat sand rat is an advantageous model for studying the interactions between photoperiods and mood the current study was designed to evaluate the effects of voluntary exercise on activity rhythms and anxiety and depression like behaviors in sand rats as a step towards better understanding of the underlying mechanisms male sand rats were housed in short photoperiod h light num h dark or neutral light h light h dark regimens for num weeks and divided into subgroups with or without running wheels activity was monitored for num additional weeks and then animals were tested in the elevated plus maze the forced swim test and the social interaction test activity rhythms were enhanced by the running wheels as hypothesized voluntary exercise had significant effects on animals anxiety and depression like behaviors but not on animals results are discussed in the context of interactions between physical exercise circadian rhythms and mood we suggest that the sand rat model can be used to explore the underlying mechanism of the effects of physical exercise for mood disorders
Circadian_Rhythms	endotoxin disrupts circadian rhythms in macrophages via reactive oxygen species the circadian clock is a transcriptional network that functions to regulate the expression of genes important in the anticipation of changes in cellular and organ function recent studies have revealed that the recognition of pathogens and subsequent initiation of inflammatory responses are strongly regulated by a macrophage intrinsic circadian clock we hypothesized that the circadian pattern of gene expression might be influenced by inflammatory stimuli and that loss of circadian function in immune cells can promote pro inflammatory behavior to investigate circadian rhythms in inflammatory cells peritoneal macrophages were isolated from mperluciferase transgenic mice and circadian oscillations were studied in response to stimuli using cosinor analysis we found that significantly altered the circadian period in peritoneal macrophages from mperluciferase mice while qpcr data suggested that the pattern of expression of the core circadian gene bmal was disrupted inhibition of offered protection from the induced impairment in rhythm suggesting a role for toll like receptor signaling to explore the mechanisms involved we inhibited stimulated and superoxide inhibition of synthesis with had no effect on circadian rhythms in contrast inhibition of superoxide with tempol or ameliorated the induced changes in circadian periodicity in gain of function experiments we found that overexpression of a source of could significantly disrupt circadian function in a circadian reporter cell line whereas inos overexpression a source of was ineffective to assess whether alteration of circadian rhythms influences macrophage function peritoneal macrophages were isolated from bmal and per mice compared to macrophages macrophages from circadian knockout mice exhibited altered balance between and release increased uptake of oxldl and increased adhesion and migration these results suggest that pro inflammatory stimuli can disrupt circadian rhythms in macrophages and that impaired circadian rhythms may contribute to cardiovascular diseases by altering macrophage behavior

Frustrative_Nonreward	gender differences in trajectories of relational aggression perpetration and victimization from middle to high school relational aggression refers to harming others through damaging or manipulating peer relationships in a cohort of students surveyed annually from middle to high school this study identified groups of adolescents who followed distinct trajectories of perpetration and of victimization of relational aggression compared the proportion of boys and girls in each trajectory and examined the overlap between perpetration and victimization trajectories the sample consisted of num randomly selected sixth graders students completed yearly surveys from grade num num we used group based trajectory modeling to identify the trajectories adolescents followed three developmental trajectories of perpetration and three similar trajectories of victimization low lowest aggression moderate and high declining high in middle school with a steep decline in high school all trajectories declined from grade num num the largest groups were the low perpetration num and low victimization num relational aggression trajectories differed by gender more boys reported perpetration and more girls reported victimization for perpetration slightly more boys than girls were classified in the two trajectories of higher aggression for victimization significantly fewer girls than boys were classified in the low trajectory and significantly more girls than boys were classified in the moderate trajectory there was substantial overlap of the perpetration and victimization trajectories these findings highlight the importance of implementing programs to reduce relational aggression for boys and for girls
Frustrative_Nonreward	pubertal timing and youth internalizing psychopathology the role of relational aggression the current study examined relational aggression as a potential mechanism that explains the association between off time pubertal development and internalizing problems in youth youth gender was also examined as a moderator for the association between these variables it was hypothesized that early pubertal maturation would be associated with higher levels of relationally aggressive behavior which in turn would be associated with elevated levels of internalizing problems parents of num children between the ages of num and num were recruited through amazon s mechanical turk parents responded to demographic information about themselves as well as information about their child s pubertal timing relationally aggressive behavior and anxiety and depressive symptoms findings indicated that early pubertal timing was associated with higher levels of anxiety directly and higher levels of both anxiety and depressive symptoms indirectly through higher levels of relational aggression in all but one of the pathways examined gender was not found to moderate the associations between the study variables of interest this study is the first to examine relational aggression as a mechanism by which early pubertal timing leads to internalizing problems the findings suggest that relational aggression could be a target for intervention among early developing youth who are at risk for internalizing problems
Frustrative_Nonreward	we re not gonna be friends anymore associations between viewing relational aggression on television and relational aggression in text messaging during adolescence number of studies suggest that adolescents who view relational aggression on television are more likely to engage in higher levels of subsequent relational aggression in social interactions this study examined longitudinal associations between viewing relational aggression on television and relationally aggressive behavior in text messaging over a num year period during adolescence participants were num adolescents who completed a number of questionnaires regarding media use and aggression adolescents were each given a blackberry device and a sample of text messages was coded for aggressive behavior results revealed that exposure to relational aggression on television was associated with higher levels of relational aggression in texting one year later but only for girls results are discussed with reference to the general aggression model

Frustrative_Nonreward	televised relational and physical aggression and children s hostile intent attributions an experiment was conducted with num children mean age num years in third to fifth grades to test whether exposure to different forms of aggression in the media affected hostile attributional biases in response to different forms of provocation scenarios children were randomly assigned to watch a clip containing physical aggression relational aggression or no aggression after exposure children were asked to respond to a series of written provocation scenarios where a character caused some form of harm instrumental or relational to a target person but the intent of the provocateur was ambiguous results revealed that exposure to relationally aggressive portrayals resulted in a hostile attributional bias in response to relational scenarios whereas exposure to portrayals of physical aggression was associated with a hostile attributional bias in response to instrumental scenarios moreover these biases were shown to be specific to the exposure condition physical or relational and not simply associated with exposure to aggression in general the findings are discussed in terms of the general aggression model and children s social information processing
Frustrative_Nonreward	proactive reactive and romantic relational aggression in adulthood measurement predictive validity gender differences and association with intermittent explosive disorder the psychometric properties of a recently introduced adult self report of relational aggression are presented specifically the predictive utility of proactive and reactive peer directed relational aggression as well as romantic relational aggression are explored in a large num study of adults the measure had adequate reliability and validity and the subscales demonstrated unique predictive abilities for a number of dependent variables in particular reactive but not proactive relational aggression was uniquely associated with history of abuse hostile attribution biases and feelings of distress regarding relational provocation situations reactive relational aggression was also more strongly related to anger and hostility than proactive aggression in addition relational aggression in the context of romantic relationships was uniquely related to anger hostility impulsivity history of abuse hostile attribution biases and emotional sensitivity to relational provocations even when controlling for peer directed relational aggression gender differences in overall levels of relational aggression were not observed however males were most likely to engage in peer directed proactive and reactive relational aggression whereas females were most likely to engage in romantic relational aggression in a second study num relational aggression was higher in a sample of adults with intermittent explosive disorder than in a sample of healthy controls or psychiatric controls the findings highlight the importance of assessing subtypes of relational aggression in adult samples ways in which this measure may extend research in psychology and psychiatry are discussed
Frustrative_Nonreward	insecure attachment behavior and partner violence incorporating couple perceptions of insecure attachment and relational aggression intimate partner violence and insecure attachment are therapeutically relevant concepts when working with couples the link between attachment and intimate partner violence has been examined in the literature but an area of aggression that often goes unexamined is relational aggression or using third parties as a means of being aggressive toward a partner we asked how participants attachment behaviors were related to their own and partners relational and physical aggression we used structural equation modeling to estimate actor partner interdependence among these relationships in num heterosexual couples results indicated significant partner paths from attachment to relational aggression as well as significant actor paths between relational aggression and physical aggression implications were discussed data for this study were collected from the assessment
Frustrative_Nonreward	dwelling on it may make it worse the links between relational victimization relational aggression rumination and depressive symptoms in adolescents although there is considerable evidence that relational victimization is associated with depressive symptoms in youth our understanding about the mechanisms by which victimization and depressive symptoms are linked is limited the current study explored ruminating about victimization experiences as a potential mechanism that might contribute to an understanding of the association between relational victimization and depressive symptoms we also tested the specificity of the proposed models by controlling for and testing parallel models of a highly related behavior relational aggression sample of num adolescents from sixth through eighth grades participated teacher reports were used to assess relational victimization and relational aggression self reports were used to assess depressive symptoms and rumination the results showed that rumination partially mediated the association between relational victimization and depressive symptoms no moderation effect was found in contrast rumination moderated the association between relational aggression and depressive symptoms specifically relational aggression was associated with depressive symptoms for those adolescents who were also ruminators thus ruminating about victimization experiences appears to be an important mechanism that functions differently for relational aggression and relational victimization in conferring risk for depressive symptoms the findings offer important practical implications for those working with adolescents and also lay the groundwork for future research

Loss	is rumination after bereavement linked with loss avoidance evidence from eye tracking rumination is a risk factor in adjustment to bereavement it is associated with and predicts psychopathology after loss yet the function of rumination in bereavement remains unclear in the past researchers often assumed rumination to be a maladaptive confrontation process however based on cognitive avoidance theories of worry in generalised anxiety disorder and rumination after post traumatic stress disorder others have suggested that rumination may serve to avoid painful aspects of the loss thereby contributing to complicated grief to examine if rumination is linked with loss avoidance an eye tracking study was conducted with num bereaved individuals num high and num low ruminators on num trials participants looked for num seconds at a picture of the deceased and a picture of a stranger randomly combined with negative neutral or loss related words high ruminators were expected to show initial vigilance followed by subsequent disengagement for loss stimuli i e picture deceased with a loss word in the first num ms additionally we expected high ruminators to avoid these loss stimuli and to show attentional preference for non loss related negative stimuli i e picture stranger with a negative word on longer exposure durations num num ms contrary to expectations we found no evidence for an effect of rumination on vigilance and disengagement of loss stimuli in the first num ms however in the num num ms interval high ruminators showed shorter gaze times for loss stimuli and longer gaze times for negative and neutral non loss related stimuli even when controlling for depression and complicated grief symptom levels effects of rumination on average fixation times mirrored these findings this suggests that rumination and loss avoidance are closely associated potential clinical implication is that rumination and grief complications after bereavement may be reduced through the use of exposure and acceptance based therapeutic techniques

Loss	the dangers of euthanasia and dementia how kantian thinking might be used to support non voluntary euthanasia in cases of extreme dementia some writers have argued that a kantian approach to ethics can be used to justify suicide in cases of extreme dementia where a patient lacks the rationality required of kantian moral agents worry that this line of thinking may lead to the more extreme claim that euthanasia is a proper kantian response to severe dementia and similar afflictions such morally treacherous thinking seems to be directly implied by the arguments that lead dennis cooley and similar writers to claim that kant might support suicide if rationality is the only factor in valuing a human life then the loss of that rationality however such loss might be defined would allow us to use essentially utilitarian thinking in order to support non voluntary euthanasia since the patients themselves would no longer be moral agents that demand respect

Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	transmitting the sum of all fears iranian nuclear threat salience among offspring of holocaust survivors many israelis are preoccupied with the prospect of a nuclear armed iran frequently associating it with the danger of annihilation that existed during the holocaust the current article examined whether offspring of holocaust survivors are especially preoccupied and sensitive to the iranian threat and whether this susceptibility is a part of their increased general image of actual and potential threats defined as the hostile world scenario study num num showed that relative to comparisons reported more preoccupation with the iranian nuclear threat moreover the positive relationship between the salience of the iranian threat and symptoms of anxiety was stronger among study num num replicated these findings while focusing on the iranian nuclear threat salience and symptoms of psychological distress it further showed that reported more negative engagement with the i e feeling that surrounding threats decrease one s sense of competence which in turn mediated their increased preoccupation with the iranian threat the results suggest that intergenerational transmission of the holocaust trauma includes heightened preoccupation with and sensitivity to potential threats of annihilation and that the specific preoccupation with threats of annihilation reflects a part of a more general preoccupation with surrounding threats
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	effects of age and pathology on stance modifications in response to increased postural threat this study investigated modifications to standing posture in response to elevated postural anxiety evoked by a potential physical threat to stability sixteen young adults num older adults and num patients diagnosed with parkinson s disease stood with or without the expectation of a threat to their posture i e external trunk perturbation this method allowed for the assessment of the effects of anticipatory anxiety on standing posture associated with an ecologically valid and direct threat to stability our manipulation was successful as all participants independent of age and disease reported significant increases in postural anxiety when anticipating a threat to their posture the trunk sway modifications observed in response to elevated postural anxiety were dependent on age and disease young adults showed increased trunk sway in both pitch and roll directions while older adults demonstrated decreased trunk sway but only in the roll direction when standing and expecting a threat to posture compared to standing without this threat individuals with showed no significant changes in trunk pitch or roll sway when anticipating a threat to posture compared to standing without this threat our findings suggest that the effects of postural anxiety on postural control are dependent on the context associated with the postural threat and age and disease status
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	the effect of challenge and threat states on performance an examination of potential mechanisms challenge and threat states predict future performance however no research has examined their immediate effect on motor task performance the present study examined the effect of challenge and threat states on golf putting performance and several possible mechanisms one hundred twenty seven participants were assigned to a challenge or threat group and performed six putts during which emotions gaze putting kinematics muscle activity and performance were recorded challenge and threat states were successively manipulated via task instructions the challenge group performed more accurately reported more favorable emotions and displayed more effective gaze putting kinematics and muscle activity than the threat group multiple putting kinematic variables mediated the relationship between group and performance suggesting that challenge and threat states impact performance at a predominately kinematic level
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	the neural basis of improved cognitive performance by threat of shock anxiety can have both detrimental and facilitatory cognitive effects this study investigates the neural substrates of a replicated facilitatory effect of anxiety on sustained attention and response inhibition this effect consisted of improved performance on the sustained attention to response task a go nogo task consisting of num go and num nogo trials in threat unpredictable electrical shock vs safe no shock conditions this study uses the same experimental design with fmri and relies on an event related analysis of signal changes findings reveal that threat related cognitive facilitation improved nogo accuracy is associated with greater activation of a right lateralized frontoparietal group of regions previously implicated in sustained attention and response inhibition moreover these same regions show decreased activation in the go trials preceding nogo errors during nogo trials striatal activity is also greater in the threat vs safe condition consistent with the notion of enhanced inhibitory processing under threat these findings identify potential mechanisms by which threat of unpredictable shock can facilitate distinct cognitive functions greater understanding of the complex interaction of the anxious state and cognitive processes may have critical clinical implications
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	anxious anticipation and pain the influence of instructed vs conditioned threat on pain negative emotions such as anxiety enhance pain perception however certain threat characteristics are discussed to have different or even divergent effects on pain hypoalgesia vs hyperalgesia in order to investigate the neurobiological basis of different threats we compared the impact of conditioned threat vs instructed threat on pain using fmri in two groups participants underwent either pavlovian threat conditioning or an instructed threat procedure afterwards in an identical test phase participants watched the same visual cues from the previous phase indicating potential threat or safety and received painful thermal stimulation in the test phase pain ratings were increased in both groups under threat group comparisons show elevated responses in amygdala and hippocampus for pain under threat in the group and higher activation of the mid cingulate gyrus in the group psychophysiological interaction analyses in demonstrated elevated connectivity of the amygdala and the insula for the comparison of pain under threat vs safety in the same comparison revealed elevated functional connectivity of the and the insula the results suggest a similar pain augmenting effect of and which however seems to rely on different networks mediating the impact of threat on pain
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	effect of anxiety on behavioural pattern separation in humans behavioural pattern separation the ability to distinguish among similar stimuli based on subtle physical differences has been used to study the mechanism underlying stimulus generalisation fear overgeneralisation is often observed in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder and other anxiety disorders however the relationship between anxiety and remains unclear the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of anxiety threat of shock on which was assessed across separate encoding and retrieval sessions images were encoded retrieved during blocks of threat or safety in a num x num factorial design during retrieval participants indicated whether images were new old or altered better accuracy was observed for altered images encoded during periods of threat compared to safety but only if those images were also retrieved during periods of safety these results suggest that overgeneralisation in anxiety may be due to altered pattern separation
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	behavioral and measures of attentional bias to threat in the dot probe task poor reliability and lack of correlation with anxiety the dot probe task is often considered a gold standard in the field for investigating attentional bias to threat however serious issues with the task have been raised specifically a number of studies have demonstrated that the traditional reaction time measure of attentional bias to threat in the dot probe task has poor internal reliability and poor test retest reliability in addition although threatening stimuli capture attention in other paradigms attentional bias to threat has not usually been found in typical research participants in the dot probe task however when attention is measured in the dot probe task with the npc component of the event related potential waveform substantial attentional orienting to threat is observed and the internal reliability is moderate to provide a rigorous comparison of the reliability of this npc measure and the conventional behavioral measure as well as to examine the relationship of these measures to anxiety the present study examined the npc in conjunction with in the dot probe task in a large sample of participants num as in previous studies showed no bias to threatening images across the sample and exhibited poor internal reliability moreover this measure did not relate to trait anxiety by contrast the npc revealed a significant initial shift of attention to threat and this measure was internally reliable however the npc was not correlated with trait anxiety indicating that it does not provide a meaningful index of individual differences in anxiety in the dot probe task together these results indicate a serious need to develop new tasks and methods to more reliably investigate attentional bias to threat and its relationship to anxiety in both clinical and non clinical populations
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	behavioral and neural stability of attention bias to threat in healthy adolescents considerable translational research on anxiety examines attention bias to threat and the efficacy of attention training in reducing symptoms imaging research on the stability of brain functions engaged by attention bias tasks could inform such research perturbed fronto amygdala function consistently arises in attention bias research on adolescent anxiety the current report examines the stability of the activation and functional connectivity of these regions on the dot probe task functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri activation and connectivity data were acquired with the dot probe task in num healthy youth f num mean age num years num num at two time points separated by approximately nine weeks intraclass correlations demonstrate good reliability in both neural activation for the ventrolateral and task specific connectivity for fronto amygdala circuitry behavioral measures showed generally poor test retest reliability these findings suggest potential avenues for future brain imaging work by highlighting brain circuitry manifesting stable functioning on the dot probe attention bias task
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	postdeployment threat related attention bias interacts with combat exposure to account for and anxiety symptoms in soldiers recent studies suggest that assessment of threat related attention bias may be useful in identifying soldiers at risk for clinical symptoms the present study assessed the degree to which soldiers experienced combat events and showed attentional threat avoidance affected their reported levels of post traumatic stress disorder and anxiety symptoms four months after a combat deployment to iraq num soldiers completed a survey assessing combat exposures and clinical symptoms as well as a dot probe task assessing threat related attention bias significant three way interactions regressing threat reaction times rts neutral rts and combat exposure on and anxiety symptoms were observed specifically soldiers with high levels of combat exposure who were more likely to demonstrate attentional bias away from threat were also more symptomatic these results demonstrate the potential of threat related attention bias as a behavioral marker of and anxiety symptoms in a high risk military occupational context
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	the interaction of anticipatory anxiety and emotional picture processing an event related brain potential study the present study examined the interaction of anticipatory anxiety and selective emotion processing toward this end a rapid stream of pleasant neutral and unpleasant pictures was presented in alternating blocks of threat of shock or safety which were signaled by colored picture frames the main finding is that pleasant pictures elicited a sustained negative difference potential over occipital regions during threat as compared to safety periods in contrast unpleasant and neutral picture processing did not vary as a function of threat of shock furthermore in both the safety and threat of shock conditions emotional pictures elicited an enlarged early posterior negativity and late positive potential these data show that the activation of the fear anxiety network exerts valence specific effects on affective picture processing pleasant stimuli mismatching the current state of anticipatory anxiety apparently draw more attentional resources
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	what does the facial dot probe task tell us about attentional processes in social anxiety systematic review current models of assume that attentional processes play a pivotal role in the etiology and maintenance of social anxiety disorder social anxiety is supposedly associated with an attentional bias towards disorder related stimuli such as threatening faces using the facial dot probe task in socially anxious individuals has however revealed inconsistent findings the current systematic review aims at disentangling the heterogeneous findings using effect sizes across results by systematically taking into account potential moderating variables stimulus type stimulus duration situational anxiety disorder severity results provide some evidence that socially anxious individuals preferentially allocate their attention towards threat faces compared to non anxious controls this bias seems to depend on the type of reference stimulus stimulus duration and clinical level of social anxiety avoidance of threat was neither found at early nor at later stages of attentional processing importantly the results have to be considered in the light of the only few studies available given the heterogeneity of results and some methodological restrictions of the studies included the picture of attentional bias seems to be much less clear than suggested in the recent social anxiety literature methodologically combined measures of dot probe and eye movement measures might be beneficial to detect overt attentional biases importantly our results show that preferential processing of threat cues might guide early attentional processes in social anxiety depending however on several contextual and situational factors clinically patients with greater severity of may be more prone to such an attentional bias thus therapists should take this into account when planning behavioral experiments and exposure therapy
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	perceived threat in childhood a review of research and implications for children living in violent households the current study is a review of existing literature on perceived threat across childhood num num years there is strong evidence from this body of research that threat detection emerges in infancy and is present throughout childhood with meaningful links to child adjustment the wide range of methodologies employed to assess threat include biological measures event related potential and functional magnetic resonance imaging observational data gaze duration and response time and a range of ways of gathering cognitive data threat appraisal across methodologies a uniform finding is that children who have higher threat attenuation are at increased risk for the development of anxiety disorders it also seems that children s attention to threatening stimuli may vary across development with heightened attention in infancy and early childhood these findings have meaningful extensions for children who are living in violent families since many children living in violent homes are exposed to the threat of violence beginning in infancy these children may be at heightened risk as compared to their nonexposed peers for the development of maladaptive patterns of threat detection and response there is some evidence that this long standing pattern of vigilance toward threat in key developmental periods may in part explain the increased risk of the development of anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder following exposure to violence
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	memory bias for threat in generalized anxiety disorder the potential importance of stimulus relevance information processing models propose that anxious individuals are characterized by memory biases for mood congruent threat information however evidence for memory biases in generalized anxiety disorder has been mixed at best given the heterogeneity of concerns in previous use of nomothetic stimulus sets may have precluded detection of memory biases therefore in order to guarantee the relevance of the stimuli used in the current study individuals with each individually selected words that were of personal relevance to them using these idiographically selected words with num individuals with and num non anxious controls nacs results showed an implicit memory bias for threat words in individuals with compared with nacs furthermore there was additional evidence that individuals with may also be characterized by explicit memory bias for threat words the magnitude of group differences for explicit recall of threat words was similar to those previously observed in panic disorder limitations and future directions are discussed
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	the color of anxiety neurobehavioral evidence for distraction by perceptually salient stimuli in anxiety anxiety is reliably associated with an attentional bias favoring threatening information which is thought to be a key mechanism in the etiology and maintenance of anxious pathology however whether and how anxiety is related to attentional capture at a more basic level i e in the absence of threat is less well understood to address this gap in the literature we examined the association between anxiety and attentional capture in the context of visually salient yet affectively neutral stimuli specifically we used a visual search task in which participants were required to locate a target while ignoring a salient distractor stimulus total of num undergraduates half of whom were assigned to a state anxiety induction completed this task while event related potentials were recorded and also completed self report measures of trait and state anxiety the results revealed that trait anxiety but not state anxiety was associated with impaired attentional control in the presence of a salient distractor that is behavioral slowing and the npc event related potential a neural measure of attentional selection were enhanced for trait anxious participants when the distractor was proximate to the target and required controlled attention in order to inhibit it these findings extend previous work by providing evidence from multiple levels of analysis that attentional aberrations in anxiety reflect broad deficits in inhibiting distracting stimuli and are not limited to threat relevant contexts
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	anxiety sensitivity explains associations between anxious arousal symptoms and smoking abstinence expectancies perceived barriers to cessation and problems experienced during past quit attempts among low income smokers disproportionately more smokers report low income and mental health problems relative to non smokers low income smokers may use smoking to alleviate negative emotional states resulting from exposure to multiple stressors yet little work has been devoted to elucidating mechanisms that may explain the association between negative emotional states and smoking related processes among low income smokers the present study sought to address this gap by examining anxiety sensitivity a transdiagnostic factor related to both anxiety and smoking as a potential mediator for the influence of anxiety symptoms on smoking related processes including threat related smoking abstinence expectancies somatic symptoms and harmful consequences perceived barriers for cessation and problems experienced during past quit attempts participants included treatment seeking daily cigarette smokers n num num num male mage num num num num results indicated that anxiety symptoms exerted a significant indirect effect through anxiety sensitivity for threat related smoking abstinence expectancies somatic symptoms and harmful consequences perceived barriers for cessation and problems experienced during past quit attempts the present results provide empirical support that anxiety sensitivity may be an underlying mechanism that partially explains the relation between anxiety symptoms and smoking processes among low income treatment seeking smokers findings broaden current theoretical understanding of pathways through which anxiety symptoms contribute to maladaptive smoking processes and cognitions among socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers

Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	emotional response patterns during social threat in individuals with generalized social anxiety disorder and non anxious controls patterns of synchrony in repeated measures of heart rate skin conductance levels negative affect and positive affect were investigated in patients with social anxiety disorder and non anxious controls during a speech task despite expected low levels of absolute concordance between measures of affect and arousal overall results revealed clearly defined and specific patterns of emotional response coherence that distinguished between the two groups and depended on the types of measures used specifically findings demonstrated that a for both patients and controls increased heart rate was significantly synchronized with increased negative affect with patients showing overall stronger levels of synchrony between these two measures than controls b for controls only increased heart rate was significantly synchronized with increased positive affect and c for patients only increased skin conductance was significantly synchronized with both increased negative affect and decreased positive affect these findings are discussed in relation to current conceptualizations of the construct of emotion as well as directions for future research and potential implications for clinical practice
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	neural responses to affective pictures while anticipating and perceiving respiratory threat emotional processes have an impact on the anticipation and perception of bodily threat sensations such as breathlessness however little is known about the reverse influence of breathlessness on emotional processes as well as its modulation by anxiety sensitivity here we investigated by means of visually evoked potentials how the perception versus anticipation of resistive load induced breathlessness influences emotional processing high and low anxious participants viewed pictures of positive neutral or negative content under conditions of perceived anticipated or an unloaded baseline the num num ms was significantly less positive under perceived furthermore the early late positive potential num num ms was significantly less positive during both conditions as compared to baseline overall the was significantly more positive in as compared to individuals additionally across conditions the late num num num ms was enhanced for positive and negative pictures as opposed to neutral ones for the group in contrast for the group only the positive pictures elicited the typical enhanced notably for the participants negative pictures elicited significantly blunted late lpps during perceived as compared to anticipated and baseline reversed effect i e more positivity was observed for participants suggesting motivational priming taken together these results highlight the impact of perceived and anticipated respiratory threat on the neural processing of emotional picture stimuli as well as its modulation by anxiety sensitivity levels
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	worry and discrimination of threat and safety cues an event related potential investigation overgeneralization of fear to safety cues is increasingly being studied in order to further our understanding of the maintenance of anxiety disorders the current study used event related potentials erps to evaluate whether worry affects anticipation and processing of threat and neutral pictures during a conditioning task fifty two high n num and low n num worriers completed a paradigm in which a neutral stimulus indicated the valence of a second stimulus either a threat or neutral picture results found that worriers displayed reduced anticipatory responses to both stimulus types as indexed by the stimulus preceding negativity although they displayed an increased stimulus preceding negativity to threatening images during the second half of the task in addition high and low worriers differed in processing of threat and neutral images as indexed by the late positive potential these findings support the overgeneralization of fear literature suggesting that worriers display difficulty discriminating safety cues from threat cues and this affects the attentional resources devoted to subsequent stimuli implications of these results are discussed
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	trait anxiety and conflict monitoring following threat an study threat related attentional disruptions in anxiety may relate to changes in cognitive control during task processing the present study examined this question using the event related brain potential it was predicted that threat stimuli will selectively influence the for those showing elevated trait anxiety and that reduced may reflect a compensatory process predicting better attention performance was recorded while num participants completed a cued flanker task with threat or nonthreat distracters amplitudes were greater to incongruent versus congruent flankers following threat high trait anxious participants showed reduced modulation of the by flanker type and greater amplitudes to congruent flankers reduced was associated with better attention performance this study was among the first documenting the emotional modulation of the related to the threat bias and its links with attention interference in anxiety
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	complementary features of attention bias modification therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy in pediatric anxiety disorders in the treatment of anxiety disorders attention bias modification therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy may have complementary effects by targeting different aspects of perturbed threat responses and behaviors may target rapid implicit threat reactions whereas may target slowly deployed threat responses the authors used amygdala based connectivity during a threat attention task and a randomized controlled trial design to evaluate potential complementary features of these treatments in pediatric anxiety disorders prior to treatment youths num num years old with anxiety disorders num as well as healthy comparison youths num performed a threat attention task during functional acquisition task related amygdala based functional connectivity was assessed patients with and without imaging data num were then randomly assigned to receive paired with either active or placebo clinical response was evaluated and pretreatment amygdala based connectivity profiles were compared among patients with varying levels of clinical response compared with the plus placebo group the plus active group exhibited less severe anxiety after treatment the patient and healthy comparison groups differed in amygdala insula connectivity during the threat attention task patients whose connectivity profiles were most different from those of the healthy comparison group exhibited the poorest response to treatment particularly those who received plus placebo the study provides evidence of enhanced clinical effects for patients receiving active moreover appears to be most effective for patients with abnormal amygdala insula connectivity may target specific threat processes associated with dysfunctional amygdala insula connectivity that are not targeted by alone this may explain the observation of enhanced clinical response to plus active
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	mental health problems in adolescence and the interpretation of unambiguous threat aberrant threat perception has been linked to paranoia anxiety and other mental health problems and is widely considered to be a core transdiagnostic feature of psychopathology however to date there has been only limited investigation of whether mental health problems are associated with a biased interpretation of stimuli that have explicit as opposed to ambiguous connotations of threat in the present study num adolescents diagnosed with a mental illness and num demographically matched controls were asked to provide danger ratings of stimuli normatively rated as being either low or high in potential threat all participants were also asked to complete background measures of cognitive function mental health and wellbeing the results indicated that the two groups did not differ in their capacity to discriminate between low and high threat stimuli nor did they differ in the absolute level of threat that they attributed to these stimuli however for the control group the overall level of threat perceived in facial stimuli was correlated with two important indices of mental health depression and anxiety no associations emerged in the clinical group these data are discussed in relation to their potential implications for the role of aberrant threat perception in transdiagnostic models of mental health
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	situation based social anxiety enhances the neural processing of faces evidence from an intergroup context social anxiety is the intense fear of negative evaluation by others and it emerges uniquely from a social situation given its social origin we asked whether an anxiety inducing social situation could enhance the processing of faces linked to the situational threat while past research has focused on how individual differences in social anxiety relate to face processing we tested the effect of manipulated social anxiety in the context of anxiety about appearing racially prejudiced in front of a peer visual processing of faces was indexed by the component of the event related potential participants viewed faces of black and white males along with nonfaces either in private or while being monitored by the experimenter for signs of prejudice in a public condition results revealed a difference in the response to black and whites faces that emerged only in the public condition and only among participants high in dispositional social anxiety these results provide new evidence that anxiety arising from the social situation modulates the earliest stages of face processing in a way that is specific to a social threat and they shed new light on how anxiety effects on perception may contribute to the regulation of intergroup responses
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	impact of anxiety symptoms and problematic alcohol use on error related brain activity anxiety disorders are associated with enhanced defensive reactivity to errors measured via the error related negativity there is some evidence to suggest that problematic alcohol use is also associated with an enhanced although prior studies have been almost exclusively in men and have yet to examine the potential interactive effects of anxiety and alcohol abuse symptoms the aim of the current study was to address the gaps in this literature by examining the unique and interactive effects of anxiety symptoms and problematic alcohol use on the in a sample of num heterogeneous internalizing disorder patients all participants completed a flanker task designed to robustly elicit the and questionnaires assessing current internalizing symptoms and problematic alcohol use as expected results revealed that greater anxiety symptoms but not depressive symptoms were associated with a more enhanced there was no main effect of problematic alcohol use but there was a significant anxiety by problematic alcohol use interaction at high anxiety symptoms greater problematic alcohol use was associated with a more enhanced at low anxiety symptoms alcohol use was unrelated to the there was no depression by alcohol abuse interaction the findings suggest that within anxious individuals heightened reactivity to errors threat may be related to risk for alcohol abuse the findings also converge with a broader literature suggesting that heightened reactivity to threat may be a shared vulnerability factor for anxiety and alcohol abuse and a novel prevention and intervention target for anxiety alcohol abuse comorbidity
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	distinct electrocortical and behavioral evidence for increased attention to threat in generalized anxiety disorder neural activity is increasingly used in addition to behavioral measures to study anxiety and attentional biases toward threatening stimuli event related potentials erps might be particularly useful because of their excellent temporal resolution in particular the late positive potential reflects increased attention to emotional stimuli and was recently found to be larger with increasing state anxiety this study sought to examine the among individuals with generalized anxiety disorder fifteen individuals with and num healthy controls hcs viewed briefly presented pairs of aversive and neutral pictures that were presented to the left and right of as well as above and below fixation on each trial and behavioral measures were recorded as participants indicated whether the horizontal or vertical image pairs were the same or different aversive pictures presented in unattended locations were associated with more errors overall and this effect was larger in than participants moreover aversive targets elicited larger lpps across all participants this difference was larger in than participants when distracters were neutral threatening stimuli presented in both target and distracting spatial locations have a greater impact on than participants behavioral and measures provide complimentary indices of attention toward threat in in terms of attentional control theory behavioral interference indexes impaired processing effectiveness whereas the might index reduced processing efficiency in both measures may provide unique windows onto how increased stimulus driven attention to threat impacts and characterizes
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	delineating the role of negative verbal thinking in promoting worry perceived threat and anxiety worry is characterized by streams of verbal thoughts about potential negative outcomes individuals with high levels of worry and particularly those with generalized anxiety disorder find it very difficult to control worry once it has started what is not clear is the extent to which verbal negative thinking style maintains worry our study aimed to disentangle the effects of verbal versus imagery based thinking and negative versus positive worry related content on subsequent negative intrusive thoughts high worriers were trained to engage in imagery or verbal processing focusing on either negative or positive outcomes of their current main worry both thinking style and valence of worry content influenced later negative intrusive thoughts that play a role in initiating worry episodes in contrast only valence influenced subjective ratings of worry outcomes i e cost concern and ability to cope although not probability with positive valence leading to lower ratings irrespective of thinking style

Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	late life anxiety is coming of age anxiety is an adaptive human experience that may occur at all ages and serves to help draw attention to avoid or cope with immanent threat and danger given its evolutionary importance it has strong genetic and biological underpinnings and when it serves that adaptive function for the organism anxiety may be viewed as useful however complex adaptive systems such as our adaptation to threat or stress by definition provide many and often interrelated points of breakdown or dysregulation which if sustained may lead to psychopathology anxiety has been described as a common currency for psychopathology indicating that it is a first line and universal way for us to respond to stress and threat it is more or less prominent in patients diagnosed with practically all psychiatric or neurodegenerative disorders this has lead to the inclusion of anxiety as a cross cutting symptom measure in the development of num num given that they are rooted in a complex adaptive system that has many potential points of impact to develop pathology it is not surprising that anxiety disorders are extremely heterogeneous this heterogeneity of anxiety disorders pertains to symptomatology etiology and outcomes and poses great challenges to both research and clinical practice
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	defensive motivation and attention in anticipation of different types of predictable and unpredictable threat startle and event related potential investigation predictability is an important characteristic of threat that impacts defensive motivation and attentional engagement supporting research has primarily focused on actual threat e g shocks and it is unclear whether the predictability of less intense threat e g unpleasant pictures similarly affects motivation and attention the present study utilized a within subject design and examined defensive motivation startle reflex and self reported anxiety and attention probe and in anticipation of shocks and unpleasant pictures during a no predictable and unpredictable threat task this study also examined the impact of predictability on the to shocks and late positive potential to unpleasant pictures the startle reflex and self reported anxiety were increased in anticipation of both types of threat relative to no threat furthermore startle potentiation in anticipation of unpredictable threat was greater for shocks compared to unpleasant pictures but there was no difference for predictable threat the probe was enhanced in anticipation of unpredictable threat relative to predictable threat and no threat and the probe was suppressed in anticipation of predictable and unpredictable threat relative to no threat these effects did not differ between the shock and unpleasant picture trials finally the and early component were increased in response to unpredictable relative to predictable shocks and unpleasant pictures respectively the present study suggests that the unpredictability of unpleasant pictures increases defensive motivation but to a lesser degree relative to actual threat moreover unpredictability enhances attentional engagement in anticipation of and in reaction to both types of threat
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	intolerance of uncertainty appraisals coping and anxiety the case of the num pandemic although ambiguous and uncertain situations such as those dealing with the threat of widespread viral illness may have pronounced psychological ramifications there have been few studies that examined the factors that contributed to such outcomes the purpose of the present investigation was to examine emotional reactions to a health threat structural equation model examined the interplay between anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty as sequentially mediated by appraisals and coping strategies adult participants over the age of num num num completed online self report measures during the pandemic in num greater intolerance of uncertainty was related to lower appraisals of self and other control which predicted low levels of problem focused coping and greater reports of related anxiety additionally individuals with a high intolerance of uncertainty were more likely to perceive the pandemic as threatening and also were more apt to use emotion focused coping strategies and both of these factors predicted elevated levels of anxiety together these data indicate that threats such as those related to a potential pandemic not only have implications for physical health but also for psychological distress and that such outcomes vary with a constellation of appraisal and coping factors what is already known on this subject it has been established that the public is often confused by the threat that a potential pandemic virus poses and that they are unsure of what information related to the disease they can trust government health agencies often walk the line of minimizing the threat to prevent panic but simultaneously emphasize the importance of action vaccination to prevent a worldwide pandemic what does this study add beyond the physical threat of a pandemic a significant psychological toll may occur for certain individuals anxiety regarding is heightened amongst those who cannot tolerate uncertainty appraisals of threat control and the use of emotion focused coping mediate the above relationship
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	amygdala lesions reduce anxiety like behavior in a human benzodiazepine sensitive approach avoidance conflict test rodent approach avoidance conflict tests are common preclinical models of human anxiety disorder their translational validity mainly rests on the observation that anxiolytic drugs reduce rodent anxiety like behavior here we capitalized on a recently developed approach avoidance conflict computer game to investigate the impact of benzodiazepines and of amygdala lesions on putative human anxiety like behavior in successive epochs of this game participants collect monetary tokens on a spatial grid while under threat of virtual predation in a preregistered randomized double blind placebo controlled trial we tested the effect of a single dose num mg of lorazepam n num we then compared num patients with bilateral amygdala lesions due to urbach wiethe syndrome with age and gender matched control participants n num based on a previous report the primary outcome measure was the effect of intra epoch time i e an adaptation to increasing potential loss on presence in the safe quadrant of the spatial grid we hypothesized reduced loss adaptation in this measure under lorazepam and in patients with amygdala lesions lorazepam and amygdala lesions reduced loss adaptation in the primary outcome measure we found similar results in several secondary outcome measures the relative reduction of anxiety like behavior in patients with amygdala lesions was qualitatively and quantitatively indistinguishable from an impact of anterior hippocampus lesions found in a previous report our results establish the translational validity of human approach avoidance conflict tests in terms of anxiolytic drug action we identified the amygdala in addition to the hippocampus as a critical structure in human anxiety like behavior
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	threat detection precautionary responses and anxiety disorders study of the anxiety disorders may be a particularly useful vehicle for demonstrating how foundational sciences e g cognitive affective neuroscience evolutionary psychology can advance psychiatric theory and research here we consider important potential advances and remaining future challenges when basic research on threat detection and precautionary responses is used to address the anxiety disorders we emphasize the potential value of a model of threat detection and precautionary responses that integrates cognitive affective neuroscience and evolutionary approaches for understanding the anxiety disorders however we also suggest that substantial additional work is needed in order to link systematically the psychobiological mechanisms posited by basic work on threat detection and precautionary responses to the complex phenomena seen in the clinic
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	threat related amygdala activity is associated with peripheral concentrations in men but not women increased levels of peripheral inflammatory markers including reactive protein are associated with increased risk for depression anxiety and suicidality the brain mechanisms that may underlie the association between peripheral inflammation and internalizing problems remain to be determined the present study examines associations between peripheral concentrations and threat related amygdala activity a neural biomarker of depression and anxiety risk in a sample of num young adult undergraduate students participants underwent functional scanning while performing an emotional face matching task to obtain a measure of threat related amygdala activity to angry and fearful faces concentrations were assayed from dried blood spots results indicated a significant interaction between and sex in men but not women higher was associated with higher threat related amygdala activity these results add to the literature finding associations between systemic levels of inflammation and brain function and suggest that threat related amygdala activity may serve as a potential pathway through which heightened chronic inflammation may increase risk for mood and anxiety problems
Sleep_Wakefulness	effects of second generation histamine receptor antagonists on the sleep wakefulness cycle in rats the present study was performed to examine the sedative effects of second generation histamine num receptor antagonist using power spectrum analysis in the rat similar to ketotifen olopatadine caused a decrease in sleep latency at a dose of num mg kg while epinastine and cetirizine showed no significant effect even at a dose of num mg kg on the other hand no significant difference was observed in the total times of wakefulness non rapid eye movement sleep and rapid eye movement sleep by any drugs used in the experiments the number of sleep phases and interval between sleep phases were also unchanged by these drugs ketotifen and olopatadine inhibited num mepyramine binding to rat brain homogenates in parallel with a decrease in sleep latency no significant effect was observed with epinastine and cetirizine on num mepyramine binding these findings suggest that the differences in the central nervous system depressant effect observed in second generation num receptor antagonists may be due to their liability to penetrate into the
Sleep_Wakefulness	circadian rhythms in body temperature and sleep num hour variation of core body temperature in humans is primarily regulated by the endogenous circadian pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the expression of circadian rhythm is modified by the thermoregulatory mechanism controlling heat production and heat loss which also show circadian rhythms on the other hand circadian rhythms in sleep wakefulness are expressed by two independent but mutually coupled oscillators the circadian pacemaker and the oscillator specific to sleep wakefulness however neither the mechanism nor the site of oscillation of the latter is known the time cues for these two oscillators are different they are usually but frequently uncoupled under free running conditions body temperature and sleep wakefulness influence the counterpart in various extents exerting masking effects on either circadian rhythm
Sleep_Wakefulness	reaction of sleep wakefulness cycle to stress is related to differences in hypothalamo pituitary adrenal axis reactivity in rat acute stress is known to modify sleep wakefulness cycle although with considerable interindividual differences the origin of these individual differences remains unknown one possibility is an involvement of the hypothalamo pituitary adrenal axis as its reactivity is correlated with an individual s behavioral reactivity to stress and it is known to influence the sleep wakefulness cycle the present study was designed to analyze relationships between natural differences in behavioral reactivity to stress associated with differential reactivity and stress induced changes in sleep wakefulness adult rats were classified into two sub groups according to their locomotor reactivity to a mild stress novel environment the low responders and the high responders animals exhibited different glucocorticoid secretion in response to stress we show that immobilization stress induced an increase in wakefulness in animals and a decrease in wakefulness in animals on the other hand paradoxical sleep was increased in both and animals moreover we observed that animals slept more than the animals whereas the two groups had similar levels of paradoxical sleep these results indicate that the response of the sleep wakefulness cycle to stress is related to the behavioral reactivity to stress in turn governed by the individual s reactivity of the axis the involvement of dopaminergic mechanisms is discussed
Sleep_Wakefulness	pharmacogenetic modulation of orexin neurons alters sleep wakefulness states in mice hypothalamic neurons expressing neuropeptide orexins are critically involved in the control of sleep and wakefulness although the activity of orexin neurons is thought to be influenced by various neuronal input as well as humoral factors the direct consequences of changes in the activity of these neurons in an intact animal are largely unknown we therefore examined the effects of orexin neuron specific pharmacogenetic modulation in vivo by a new method called the designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs approach using this system we successfully activated and suppressed orexin neurons as measured by fos staining and recordings suggested that excitation of orexin neurons significantly increased the amount of time spent in wakefulness and decreased both non rapid eye movement and rapid eye movement sleep times inhibition of orexin neurons decreased wakefulness time and increased sleep time these findings clearly show that changes in the activity of orexin neurons can alter the behavioral state of animals and also validate this novel approach for manipulating neuronal activity in awake freely moving animals
Sleep_Wakefulness	role of cholinergic inputs to the medial preoptic area in regulation of sleep wakefulness and body temperature in freely moving rats the medial preoptico anterior hypothalamic area receives adrenergic as well as cholinergic inputs independent studies showed that both these inputs influence sleep wakefulness and body temperature the role of the adrenergic inputs was studied earlier the role of cholinergic inputs is reported here the cholinergic agonist carbachol and antagonist scopolamine were injected into this area during the day and the night in freely moving rats and the effects on sleep wakefulness and body temperature studied it was observed that carbachol induced wakefulness accompanied by a fall in body temperature while scopolamine induced an opposite effect i e sleep accompanied by an increase in body temperature this suggested that the cholinergic input into the medial preoptic area is spontaneously active in regulating sleep wakefulness and body temperature and this regulation is mediated through muscarinic receptors present in this area the results also suggest that contrary to the action of adrenergic inputs which have a dissociated effect on sleep wakefulness and body temperature the cholinergic input is unlikely to have a dissociated effect on those functions
Sleep_Wakefulness	fine tuning circadian rhythms the importance of bmal expression in the ventral forebrain although the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus acts as the central clock in mammals the circadian expression of clock genes has been demonstrated not only in the but also in peripheral tissues and brain regions outside the however the physiological roles of extra circadian clocks in the brain remain largely elusive in response we generated nkx num bmal mice in which bmal an essential clock component was genetically deleted specifically in the ventral forebrain including the preoptic area nucleus of the diagonal band and most of the hypothalamus except the in these mice as expected oscillation was drastically attenuated in the explants of mediobasal hypothalamus whereas it was maintained in those of the although nkx num bmal mice were rhythmic and nocturnal they showed altered patterns of locomotor activity during the night in a num num h light dark cycle and during subjective night in constant darkness control mice were more active during the first half than the second half of the dark phase or subjective night whereas nkx num bmal mice showed the opposite pattern of locomotor activity temporal patterns of sleep wakefulness and feeding also changed accordingly such results suggest that along with mechanisms in the local bmal dependent clocks in the ventral forebrain are critical for generating precise temporal patterns of circadian behaviors
Sleep_Wakefulness	hypocretins involvement in the regulation of sleep wakefulness cycle and pathogenesis of narcolepsy hypocretins also called orexins are two newly discovered neuropeptides originating from the same precursor preprohypocretin the amino acid sequences of hypocretin are highly conserved among vertebrates cells bodies of hypocretin neurons are restricted mainly to the lateral and ventral hypothalamus while hypocretin fibers project throughout the brain including several areas implicated in the regulation of the sleep wakefulness cycle hypocretins act on their targets via two specific membrane bound protein coupled receptors hcrtr num and hcrtr num among the various physiological actions ascribed to hypocretins the strongest evidence are for their involvement in the integration and stabilization of arousal networks degeneration of hypocretin neurons or genetic mutations that prevent the normal synthesis of hypocretins or their receptors cause human and animal narcolepsy a neurological disorder of excessive sleepiness and abnormalities in sleep recent data point to an autoimmune origin for human narcolepsy it is believed that understanding the role of hypocretins in the pathology of narcolepsy will create the basis for the development of new strategies to effectively treat this disease
Sleep_Wakefulness	how the circadian rhythm affects sleep wakefulness and overall health background for understanding shift work disorder it is estimated that num to num of the labor force works night evening or rotating shifts these non traditional schedules can affect the circadian rhythm a self sustained rhythm of biological processes that plays an important role in modulating sleep wake function resulting in circadian rhythm sleep disorder shift work type usually referred to as shift work disorder the disorder consists of a constant or recurrent pattern of sleep interruption that results in insomnia when sleep is needed and excessive sleepiness during waking hours clinicians need more information about the role of the circadian rhythm in human functioning as well as the pathophysiology prevalence and consequences of shift work disorder so that they can recognize and diagnose this problem in clinical practice
Sleep_Wakefulness	physiology of sleep wakefulness rhythms as the most important site for sleep wakefulness change the role of the hypothalamus is particularly emphasized based on our long term experimental data after rostral midbrain transection ecog of the isolated forebrain recovered sleep wakefulness change with circadian rhythm one week after transection in this preparation after additional bilateral preoptic or posterior hypothalamic lesions ecog insomnia or coma pattern appeared respectively therefore the mechanism of sleep wakefulness change of the forebrain primarily does not depend on the lower brain stem structures such as the raphe nuclei and midbrain reticular formation hypothalamic sleep wakefulness mechanism usually receives strong influence from the suprachiasmatic nucleus but it can exert its own ultradian rhythms very irregular though in intact rats or in rats with suprachiasmatic lesions
Sleep_Wakefulness	timing and consolidation of human sleep wakefulness and performance by a symphony of oscillators daily rhythms in sleep and waking performance are generated by the interplay of multiple external and internal oscillators these include the light dark and social cycles a circadian hypothalamic oscillator oscillating virtually independently of behavior and a homeostatic oscillator driven primarily by sleep wake behavior both internal oscillators contribute to variation in many aspects of sleep and wakefulness e g sleep timing and duration sleep non sleep density sleep spindles slow wave sleep electroencephalographic oscillations during wakefulness and sleep and performance parameters including attention and memory the relative contribution of the oscillators varies greatly between these variables sleep and performance cannot be predicted by either oscillator independently but critically depend on their phase relationship and amplitude the homeostatic oscillator feeds back onto the central pacemaker or its outputs thus the amplitude of observed circadian variation in sleep and performance depends on how long we have been asleep or awake during entrainment to external num h cycles the opposing interplay between circadian and homeostatic changes in sleep propensity consolidates sleep and wakefulness some physiological correlates and mediators of both the circadian process e g melatonin and hypocretin rhythms and the homeostat e g slow wave activity and adenosine release have been established offering targets for the development of countermeasures for circadian sleep and performance disorders interindividual differences in sleep timing duration and morning or evening preference are associated with changes of circadian or sleep homeostatic processes or both molecular genetic correlates including polymorphisms in clock genes of some of these interindividual differences are emerging
Sleep_Wakefulness	role of polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule in rapid eye movement sleep regulation in rats recent evidence suggests that synaptic plasticity occurs during homeostatic processes including sleep wakefulness regulation although the underlying mechanisms are not well understood polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule is a transmembrane protein that has been implicated in various forms of plasticity to investigate whether is involved in the neuronal plasticity associated with spontaneous sleep wakefulness regulation and sleep homeostasis four studies were conducted using rats first we showed that immunoreactivity is present in close proximity to key neurons in several nuclei of the sleep wakefulness system including the tuberomammillary hypothalamic nucleus dorsal raphe nucleus and locus coeruleus second using western blot analysis and densitometric image analysis of immunoreactivity we found that num h of sleep deprivation changed neither the levels nor the general location of in the sleep wakefulness system finally we injected endoneuraminidase endo intracerebroventricularly to examine the effects of polysialic acid removal on sleep wakefulness states and electroencephalogram slow waves at both baseline and during recovery from num h of sleep deprivation endo treated rats showed a small but significant decrease in baseline rapid eye movement sleep selectively in the late light phase and a facilitated sleep rebound after sleep deprivation as compared with saline injected controls non sleep and wakefulness were unaffected by endo these results suggest that is not particularly involved in the regulation of wakefulness or non sleep but plays a role in the diurnal pattern of sleep as well as in some aspects of sleep homeostasis
Sleep_Wakefulness	effects of striatal transplantation of cells transfected with gene without pre and pro regions in mouse model of parkinson s disease previously we have shown that transgenic cells bearing the gene with deleted pre and pro regions mgdnf can release transgenic the medium conditioned by transgenic cells with mgdnf induced axonal growth in rat embryonic spinal ganglion in vitro here we demonstrate a neurotrophic effect of mgdnf on cells in vitro as well as its neuroprotective effect on dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta in vivo as indicated by improved motor coordination and sleep wakefulness cycle in the mouse model of parkinson s disease cells were transfected with a vector encoding an isoform of the human gene with deleted pre and pro regions mgdnf this factor in the medium conditioned by the transfected cells was shown to induce axonal growth in cells the early parkinson s disease model was established by injection of the dopaminergic pro neurotoxin num methyl num phenyl num num num num tetrahydropyridine into cbl num mice transgenic mgdnf cells were transplanted into the striatum caudate putamen of experimental mice the sleep wakefulness cycle was studied by continuous and motor activity monitoring num and num weeks after injection after the experiment the motor coordination of experimental animals was evaluated in the rotarod test and dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta were counted in cross sections of the midbrain administration lowered the number of tyrosine hydroxylase immunopositive cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta decreased motor coordination and increased the total wake time during the dark period the transplantation of mgdnf cells into the caudate putamen num days prior to injection smoothed these effects while the control transplantation of cells showed no notable impact transplantation of transgenic cells with the gene lacking the pre and pro sequences can protect dopaminergic neurons in the mouse midbrain from the subsequent administration of the pro neurotoxin which is confirmed by polysomnographic behavioral and histochemical data hence it is released from transfected cells and preserves the differentiation activity and neuroprotective properties
Sleep_Wakefulness	regulation of dopamine neurons in ventral tegmental area on sleep wakefulness the effects of microinjection of gamma aminobutyric acid and serotonin num into the ventral tegmental area on the activity of dopamine neurons in and sleep wakefulness were studied in rats it was observed that in aneasthetized rats microinjection of num micrograms and num num micrograms respectively decreased or increased the level of num num dihydroxyphenylacetic acid to num num num num and to num num num num of control value in the nucleus accumbens acb it was also observed that in free moving rats the time of wakefulness was respectively decreased and increased by the two drugs furthermore the time of wakefulness was enhanced following microinjection of dopamine num micrograms into acb an effect that could be blocked by haloperidal num pmol but not by num nmol the above results suggest that bilateral microinjection of and num into could exert respectively an inhibitory or an excitatory action on the dopamine neurons in mediating the sleep wakefulness effect probably through the mesolimbic system
Sleep_Wakefulness	on filo and ontogenetic development of dopaminergic regylation of wakefulness sleep cycle in vertabrates the comparative immunohistochemical researches of dofamine containing neurons and fibers are carried uot in telencephalic and diencephalic departments of the brain in different vertebratts adults rats rats aged num and num days and frogs for analysis of quantitative changes dynamics in thyrozinhydroxylase and immunoreactive material in sleep wakefulness cycle the model of sleepdeprivation is used there are found the facts of morphofunctional correlations in the reactions of dophaminergic system during ontogeny and phylogeny besides the pharmacological effects of dofamine agonist and antagonists on the sleep wakefulness cycle in young rats and in frogs are shown so dopamine and its agonist apomorphine increase in sleep wakefulness cycle duration of sleep like state ofcataplexy homolog of the sleep in frogs in num day old rats it increase the share of wakefulness and catalepsy receptors antagonist num adminisrated to frogs caused increase of wakefulness and catatonic type states duration where as receptors antagonist apomorphine increased cataleptic condition administration of dopamine antagonist haloperidol to num day old rats previously causes the increase of cataleptic state after which the slow wave sleep state is enhanced the questions of phylo ontogenetic formation of dopaminergic system regulating role in sleep wakefulness cycle when transition mainly from neurosecretory diencephalic influences of dophamine to the mainly neurotransmittory functins of telencephalic regions occured is discussed
Sleep_Wakefulness	proton pump inhibition increases rapid eye movement sleep in the rat increased bodily concentration alters cellular ph as well as sleep the proton pump which plays an important role in the homeostatic regulation of cellular ph therefore may modulate sleep we investigated the effects of the proton pump inhibitor lansoprazole on sleep wakefulness male wistar rats were surgically prepared for chronic polysomnographic recordings two different doses of lansoprazole low num mg kg high num mg kg were injected intraperitoneally in the same animal n num and sleep wakefulness was recorded for num hrs the changes in sleep wakefulness were compared statistically percent sleep amount in the vehicle and lansoprazole low dose groups was num num num num and num num num num respectively which increased significantly in the lansoprazole high dose group by num num from vehicle and num num from low dose also sleep episode numbers significantly increased in lansoprazole high dose group further the sodium hydrogen exchanger blocker amiloride num mg kg i p n num did not alter sleep wake architecture our results suggest that the proton pump plays an important role in sleep modulation and supports our view that sleep might act as a sentinel to help maintain normal level for unperturbed sleep
Sleep_Wakefulness	effects of lateral preoptic area application of orexin on sleep wakefulness deficiency of orexin a newly discovered hypothalamic peptide is thought to lead to abnormal sleepiness and cataplexy in both human narcolepsy and animal models of the disease as the contains extensive orexin terminals and is established as a sleep arousal regulatory site we evaluated a hypothesis that this site is a target for the arousal inducing effects of orexin orexin was microinjected into lateral preoptic area and the effects on sleep wakefulness and brain temperature were studied compared to saline vehicle control orexin induced an increase in wakefulness for num min and suppressed all sleep stages especially and for num and num min respectively brain temperature was not differentially affected by orexin compared to saline control the orexin induced arousal and suppression are consistent with the orexin deficiency model of narcolepsy our results suggest that the orexin terminal field or adjacent structures may be a locus of arousal regulation by this peptide and a substrate of sleep wake regulatory deficits in narcolepsy
Sleep_Wakefulness	in vivo microdialysis measures of extracellular norepinephrine in the rat amygdala during sleep wakefulness norepinephrine containing locus ceruleus has been known to participate in the regulation of the sleep wake cycle according to the differential firing rate the aim of this study was to know the change of extracellular level in the rat amygdala which are reciprocally connected with during sleep wakefulness extracellular levels in the rat amygdala were investigated during different stages of the sleep waking cycle using in vivo microdialysis and polygraphic recording dialysates were collected every num min and correlated with the results of polygraphic recording the content of was measured by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection level was the highest in active waking and when compared to level was progressively lower in quiet waking num quiet sleep num and active sleep or sleep num this result suggests that the rat amygdala also participates in the regulation of the sleep wake cycle according to the differential release
Sleep_Wakefulness	effect of ambient temperature on brain temperature and sleep wakefulness in medial preoptic area lesioned rats the changes in brain temperature and sleep wakefulness were studied in rats during their exposure to different ambient temperatures of num degrees num degrees and num degrees before and after methyl aspartic acid lesion of the medial preoptic area the medial preoptic area lesion produced a decrease in sleep and increase in brain temperature except at num degrees increase and decrease in brain temperature with slow wave sleep and paradoxical sleep respectively were observed both in normal and lesioned rats sleep wakefulness and brain temperature cycle durations were increased and their frequencies decreased at higher ambient temperature in normal rats after the medial preoptic area lesion sleep wakefulness cycle duration was decreased and frequency increased at num degrees there was no significant change in brain temperature cycles at higher ambient temperature in lesioned rats the medial preoptic area in normal rats possibly interlinks the neuronal circuits involved in regulating brain temperature and sleep wakefulness cycles the medial preoptic area is essential for increasing the sleep wakefulness cycle duration with higher ambient temperature the possible contribution of the increased brain temperature variation in producing sleep wakefulness changes cannot be ruled out the results of the study show that this area may serve as a fine tuning mechanism which helps to interlink the sleep wakefulness with the thermoregulation
Sleep_Wakefulness	extracellular histamine levels in the feline preoptic anterior hypothalamic area during natural sleep wakefulness and prolonged wakefulness an in vivo microdialysis study increased activity of the histaminergic neurons of the posterior hypothalamus has been implicated in the facilitation of behavioral wakefulness recent evidence of reciprocal projections between the sleep active neurons of the preoptic anterior hypothalamus and the histaminergic neurons of the tuberomammillary nucleus suggests that histaminergic innervation of the preoptic anterior hypothalamic area may be of particular importance in the wakefulness promoting properties of histamine to test this possibility we used microdialysis sample collection in the preoptic anterior hypothalamic area of cats during natural sleep wakefulness cycles num h of sleep deprivation induced by gentle handling playing and recovery sleep samples were analyzed by a sensitive radioenzymatic assay mean basal levels of histamine in microdialysate during periods of wakefulness num num num num pg microl did not vary during the num h of sleep deprivation however during the different sleep states dramatic changes were observed in the extracellular histamine levels of preoptic anterior hypothalamic area wakefulness non rapid eye movement sleep rapid eye movement sleep levels of histamine during rapid eye movement sleep were lowest num num num num pg microl being significantly lower than levels during non rapid eye movement sleep num num num num pg microl and being only num of wakefulness levels this pattern of preoptic anterior hypothalamic area extracellular histamine levels across the sleep wakefulness cycle closely resembles the reported single unit activity of histaminergic neurons however the invariance of histamine levels during sleep deprivation suggests that changes in histamine level do not relay information about sleep drive to the sleep promoting neurons of the preoptic anterior hypothalamic area
Sleep_Wakefulness	neurotensin co expressed in orexin producing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus plays an important role in regulation of sleep wakefulness states both orexin and neurotensin are expressed in the lateral hypothalamic area and have been implicated in the regulation of feeding motor activity and the reward system double label immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization studies showed that neurotensin colocalizes with orexin in neurons of the pharmacological studies suggested that neurotensin excites orexin producing neurons orexin neurons through activation of neurotensin receptor num num and non selective cation channels in situ hybridization study showed that most orexin neurons express neurotensin receptor num mrna but not neurotensin receptor num ntsr num mrna immunohistochemical studies showed that neurotensin immunoreactive fibers make appositions to orexin neurons neurotensin receptor antagonist decreased fos expression in orexin neurons and wakefulness time in wild type mice when administered intraperitoneally however the antagonist did not evoke any effect on these parameters in orexin neuron ablated mice these observations suggest the importance of neurotensin in maintaining activity of orexin neurons the evidence presented here expands our understanding of the regulatory mechanism of orexin neurons
Sleep_Wakefulness	receptor and adenosinergic homeostatic regulation of sleep wakefulness effects of antisense to the receptor in the cholinergic basal forebrain we hypothesized that adenosine acting via the receptor is a key factor in the homeostatic control of sleep the increase in extracellular levels of adenosine during prolonged wakefulness is thought to facilitate the transition to sleep by reducing the discharge activity of wakefulness promoting neurons in the basal forebrain adenosine receptor control of the homeostatic regulation of sleep was tested by microdialysis perfusion of antisense oligonucleotides against the mrna of the receptor in the magnocellular cholinergic region of the basal forebrain of freely behaving rats after microdialysis perfusion of receptor antisense in the basal forebrain spontaneous levels of sleep wakefulness showed a significant reduction in non rapid eye movement sleep with an increase in wakefulness after num hr of sleep deprivation the antisense treated animals spent a significantly reduced amount of time in non sleep with postdeprivation recovery sleep hours num num showing a reduction of approximately num num there was an even greater postdeprivation reduction in delta power num num and a concomitant increase in wakefulness all behavioral state changes returned to control baseline values after the cessation of antisense administration control experiments with microdialysis perfusion of nonsense randomized antisense oligonucleotides and with artificial showed no effect during postdeprivation recovery sleep or spontaneously occurring behavioral states antisense to the receptor suppressed receptor immunoreactivity but did not show any neurotoxicity as visualized by fluoro jade staining these data support our hypothesis that adenosine acting via the receptor in the basal forebrain is a key component in the homeostatic regulation of sleep
Sleep_Wakefulness	release of biogenic amines in the brain during sleep wakefulness cycle biogenic amines including acetylcholine act as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators in the brain of mammals accumulated evidences suggest the relevance of these amines to the regulatory system of sleep wakefulness cycle recent development of an in vivo microdialysis technique has revealed the existence of circadian variation in the release of these amines from various brain regions related to the regulation of sleep wakefulness this review focuses on the characteristics of the release of these amines determined by the microdialysis method in rats and cats during sleep wakefulness cycle and speculates their roles in the mechanism underlying the control of sleep and arousal state
Sleep_Wakefulness	underlying brain mechanisms that regulate sleep wakefulness cycles daily cycles of wakefulness and sleep are regulated by coordinated interactions between wakefulness and sleep regulating neural circuitry wakefulness is associated with neuronal activity in cholinergic neurons in the brainstem and basal forebrain monoaminergic neurons in the brainstem and posterior hypothalamus and hypocretin orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus that act in a coordinated manner to stimulate cortical activation on the one hand and behavioral arousal on the other hand each of these neuronal groups subserves distinct aspects of wakefulness related functions of the brain normal transitions from wakefulness to sleep involve sleep related inhibition and or disfacilitation of the multiple arousal systems the cell groups that shut off the network of arousal systems at sleep onset occur with high density in the ventral lateral preoptic area and the median preoptic nucleus mnpn of the hypothalamus preoptic neurons are activated during sleep and exhibit sleep wake state dependent discharge patterns that are reciprocal of that observed in several arousal systems neurons in the contain the inhibitory neuromodulator galanin and the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid the majority of mnpn sleep active neurons synthesize and mnpn neurons are sources of projections to arousal regulatory systems in the posterior and lateral hypothalamus and the rostral brainstem mechanisms of sleep induction by these nuclei are hypothesized to involve mediated inhibition of multiple arousal systems normal cycling between discrete behavioral states is mediated by the combined influence of a sleep need that increases with continued wakefulness and an intrinsic circadian oscillation this chapter will review anatomical and functional properties of populations of sleep wake regulating neurons focusing on recent findings supporting functional significance of the and mnpn in the regulation of sleep wake homeostasis evidence indicating that mnpn and neurons have different but complementary sleep regulatory functions will be summarized potential mechanisms that function to couple activity in these two sleep regulatory neurons will be discussed
Sleep_Wakefulness	the effect of intranasal orexin hypocretin num on sleep wakefulness and attention in narcolepsy with cataplexy narcolepsy with cataplexy is a sleep dysregulation disorder with alterations of sleep i e sleep onset periods and sleep instability deficient orexin hypocretin num signaling is assumed to be a major cause of narcolepsy with cataplexy in this study we investigated fourteen subjects with narcolepsy with cataplexy in a within subject random order crossover placebo controlled design patients received double blinded intranasal orexin num nmol or sterile water placebo in the morning administration was preceded by an adaptation night and followed by a modified maintenance of wakefulness test attention testing and a second full night of polysomnographic recording we found comparable sleep behavior during the adaptation nights between both conditions after orexin administration patients had less wake sleep transitions and a decreased sleep duration in the subsequent night patients showed an increased duration in the test of divided attention patients had fewer false reactions after orexin administration our results support orexin to be a sleep stabilizing factor and provide functional signs for effects of orexin on sleep alterations and attention in narcolepsy with cataplexy
Sleep_Wakefulness	effect of dopaminergic substances on sleep wakefulness in saline and treated mice sleep wakefulness disorders are frequent in parkinson s disease the underlying causes have yet to be elucidated but dopaminergic neurodegenerative lesions seem to contribute to appearance of the disorders and anti parkinsonian medication is known to accentuate problems hence we reasoned that studying the acute effect of dopaminergic compounds on in an animal model of might improve our knowledge of regulation in the context of partial dopaminergic depletion to this end we tested the effect of levodopa l dopa pergolide a mixed num num agonist and lisuride a num agonist on recordings in treated mice in comparison with controls our results showed that dopaminergic compounds modify amounts in both control and mice wakefulness amounts are greater in mice after l dopa num mg kg num and lisuride num mg kg num injections compared with control mice moreover the paradoxical sleep latency was significantly longer in mice after high dose l dopa administration our observations suggest that the actions of both l dopa and lisuride on differ slightly in mice relative to controls hence induced partial depletion may modulate the effect of dopaminergic compounds on regulation
Sleep_Wakefulness	reliability and validity of the daily cognitive communication and sleep profile a new instrument for monitoring sleep wakefulness and daytime function the daily cognitive communicative and sleep profile is a seven item instrument that captures daily subjective sleep quality perceived mood cognitive and communication functions the objective of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of the the was self administered daily to a convenience sample of young adults n num for two two week blocks interspersed with a two week rest period afterwards participants completed the pittsburgh sleep quality index internal consistency and criterion validity were calculated by cronbach s alpha coefficient concordance correlation coefficient and spearman rank rs correlation coefficient respectively results indicated high internal consistency cronbach s alpha num num num num among mean ratings of sleep quality on the there were significant correlations between mean ratings of sleep quality and all domains rs num num num num p num num criterion validity was established between mean sleep quality ratings on the and rs num num p num num the is a reliable and valid self report instrument to monitor daily sleep quality and perceived mood cognitive and communication functions over time amongst a normative sample of young adults further studies on its psychometric properties are necessary to clarify its utility in a clinical population
Sleep_Wakefulness	the character of sleep disturbances produced by multiple administrations of atropine the antagonist of brain muscarinic cholinergic system modification of brain muscarinic cholinergic system normal functioning can be considered as an appropriate strategy for the study of its role in sleep wakefulness cycle basic mechanisms in general and in the course maintenance of in particular for this aim systemic application of muscarinic cholinoreceptors antagonists is significant because it gives possibility to modify functioning all of known five sub types of muscarinic cholinoreceptors and to study the character of sleep disturbances in these conditions problem is very topical because the question about the intimate aspects of bmchs involvement in maintaining mechanisms still remains unsolved in cats atropine systemic administration was made once daily at num num a m and continuous registration of sleep wakefulness cycle ultradian structure lasting for num hour daily was started immediately in sum each animal received anti muscarinic drugs for num times thereafter drug administrations were ceased and registration of sleep wakefulness cycle ultradian structure was continued during num consecutive days on the basis of results obtained in these conditions we can conclude that brain muscarinic cholinergic system normal functioning is significant for basic mechanisms of sleep wakefulness cycle during wakefulness at the level of neocortex and hippocampus mchs supports only activation while it is one of the main factors in triggering and maintaining mechanisms
Sleep_Wakefulness	role of receptor in the preoptic area in the regulation of sleep wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep the role of in medial preoptico anterior hypothalamic area in the regulation of spontaneous sleep wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep was investigated in this study local microinjection of picrotoxin a antagonist into this area increased quiet wakefulness but significantly reduced deep sleep and rapid eye movement sleep both the frequency of generation and duration per episode of the latter were significantly reduced it is concluded that ergic neurotransmission in the medial preoptic area is spontaneously active in modulating the hypnogenic function including rapid eye movement sleep and the action is mediated by receptor
Sleep_Wakefulness	selective loss of receptors in orexin producing neurons results in disrupted sleep wakefulness architecture hypothalamic neurons that contain the neuropeptide orexin hypocretin play important roles in the regulation of sleep wake here we analyze the in vivo and in vitro phenotype of mice lacking the gene specifically in orexin neurons oxgko mice and demonstrate that receptors on orexin neurons are essential in stabilizing and consolidating sleep wake states in oxgko brain slices we show that the absence of receptors decreases the sensitivity of orexin neurons to both excitatory and inhibitory inputs because of augmented mediated inhibition that increases the membrane conductance and shunts postsynaptic currents in these neurons this increase in mediated inhibitory tone is apparently the result of an orexin receptor type num mediated activation of local gabaergic interneurons that project back onto orexin neurons oxgko mice exhibit severe fragmentation of sleep wake states during both the light and dark periods without showing an abnormality in total sleep time or signs of cataplexy thus receptors on orexin neurons are crucial in the appropriate control of the orexinergic tone through sleep wake states thereby stabilizing the state switching mechanisms
Sleep_Wakefulness	changes in sleep wakefulness after num hydroxydopamine lesion of the preoptic area this study was undertaken to assess the role of catecholamine fibers terminating in the preoptic area in regulating sleep wakefulness in rats sleep wakefulness was assessed on the basis of h electroencephalogram electromyogram and electro oculogram recordings before and after destruction of catecholaminergic terminals at the medial preoptic area by bilateral intracerebral injection of num hydroxydopamine num microg in num num microl there was a mild reduction in sleep and increase in wakefulness after the lesion the increase in active wakefulness observed after eight days of lesion persisted even on the th day in spite of the reduction in sleep the day night sleep ratio was not affected by num hydroxydopamine lesion of the preoptic area the results indicate that the noradrenergic fibers at the preoptic area have a hypnogenic role
Sustained_Threat	perceived threat predicts the neural sequelae of combat stress exposure to severe stressors increases the risk for psychiatric disorders in vulnerable individuals but can lead to positive outcomes for others however it remains unknown how severe stress affects neural functioning in humans and what factors mediate individual differences in the neural sequelae of stress the amygdala is a key brain region involved in threat detection and fear regulation and previous animal studies have suggested that stress sensitizes amygdala responsivity and reduces its regulation by the prefrontal cortex in this study we used a prospective design to investigate the consequences of severe stress in soldiers before and after deployment to a combat zone we found that combat stress increased amygdala and insula reactivity to biologically salient stimuli across the group of combat exposed individuals in contrast its influence on amygdala coupling with the insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex was dependent on perceived threat rather than actual exposure suggesting that threat appraisal affects interoceptive awareness and amygdala regulation our results demonstrate that combat stress has sustained consequences on neural responsivity and suggest a key role for the appraisal of threat on an amygdala centered neural network in the aftermath of severe stress
Sustained_Threat	interactions between transient and sustained neural signals support the generation and regulation of anxious emotion anxious emotion can manifest on brief threat response and or persistent chronic apprehension and arousal timescales and prior work has suggested that these signals are supported by separable neural circuitries this fmri study utilized a mixed block event related emotional provocation paradigm in num healthy participants to simultaneously measure brief and persistent anxious emotional responses testing the specificity of and interactions between these potentially distinct systems results indicated that components of emotional processing networks were uniquely sensitive to transient and sustained anxious emotion whereas the amygdala and midbrain showed only transient responses the ventral basal forebrain and anterior insula showed sustained activity during extended emotional contexts that tracked positively with task evoked anxiety states of lesser anxiety were associated with greater sustained activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex furthermore ventromedial prefrontal recruitment was lower in individuals with higher scores on intolerance of uncertainty measures and this hyporecruitment predicted greater transient amygdala responding to potential threat cues this work demonstrates how brain circuitries interact across temporal scales to support brief and persistent anxious emotion and suggests potentially divergent mechanisms of dysregulation in clinical syndromes marked by brief versus persistent symptoms of anxiety
Sustained_Threat	activity alterations in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and amygdala during threat anticipation in generalized anxiety disorder sustained anticipatory anxiety is central to generalized anxiety disorder during anticipatory anxiety phasic threat responding appears to be mediated by the amygdala while sustained threat responding seems related to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis although sustained anticipatory anxiety in patients was proposed to be associated with activity alterations firm evidence is lacking we aimed to explore temporal characteristics of and amygdala activity during threat anticipation in patients nineteen patients and nineteen healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri during a temporally unpredictable threat anticipation paradigm we defined phasic and a systematic variation of sustained response models for blood oxygen level dependent responses during threat anticipation to disentangle temporally dissociable involvement of the and the amygdala patients relative to responded with increased phasic amygdala activity to onset of threat anticipation and with elevated sustained activity that was delayed relative to the onset of threat anticipation both the amygdala and the displayed altered responses during threat anticipation in patients albeit with different time courses the results for the activation hint towards its role in sustained threat responding and contribute to a deeper understanding of pathological sustained anticipatory anxiety in
Sustained_Threat	threat of shock increases excitability and connectivity of the intraparietal sulcus anxiety disorders affect approximately num in num num americans within a given num year period placing a substantial burden on the national health care system therefore there is a critical need to understand the neural mechanisms mediating anxiety symptoms we used unbiased multimodal data driven whole brain measures of neural activity magnetoencephalography and connectivity fmri to identify the regions of the brain that contribute most prominently to sustained anxiety we report that a single brain region the intraparietal sulcus shows both elevated neural activity and global brain connectivity during threat the plays a key role in attention orienting and may contribute to the hypervigilance that is a common symptom of pathological anxiety hyperactivation of this region during elevated state anxiety may account for the paradoxical facilitation of performance on tasks that require an external focus of attention and impairment of performance on tasks that require an internal focus of attention
Sustained_Threat	sustained anxiety increases amygdala dorsomedial prefrontal coupling a mechanism for maintaining an anxious state in healthy adults neuroimaging research has traditionally explored fear and anxiety in response to discrete threat cues e g during fear conditioning however anxiety is a sustained aversive state that can persist in the absence of discrete threats little is known about mechanisms that maintain anxiety states over a prolonged period here we used a robust translational paradigm threat of shock to induce sustained anxiety recent translational work has implicated an amygdala prefrontal cortex circuit in the maintenance of anxiety in rodents to explore the functional homologues of this circuitry in humans we used a novel paradigm to examine the impact of sustained anticipatory anxiety on amygdala intrinsic connectivity task independent fmri data were collected in healthy participants during long duration periods of shock anticipation and safety we examined intrinsic functional connectivity our study involved num healthy participants during sustained anxiety amygdala activity was positively coupled with dorsomedial activity high trait anxiety was associated with increased amygdala coupling in addition induced anxiety was associated with positive coupling between regions involved in defensive responding and decreased coupling between regions involved in emotional control and the default mode network inferences regarding anxious pathology should be made with caution because this study was conducted in healthy participants findings suggest that anticipatory anxiety increases intrinsic amygdala coupling and that the may serve as a functional homologue for the rodent prefrontal regions by sustaining anxiety future research may use this defensive neural context to identify biomarkers of risk for anxious pathology and target these circuits for therapeutic intervention
Sustained_Threat	prefrontal mechanisms of fear reduction after threat offset reducing fear when a threat has disappeared protects against a continuously elevated anxiety state in this study we investigated the brain mechanism involved in this process the threat paradigm consisted of discrete cues that signaled either threat of shock or safety healthy participants were tested in two sessions in which eyeblink startle n num and blood oxygen level dependence n num were measured to index subjects defensive state and brain responses respectively startle results indicated that subjects could rapidly decrease their defensive state after the offset of shock threat functional magnetic resonance imaging data indicated that the termination of threat was associated with the recruitment of lateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortices an exploratory connectivity analysis showed that activity in these prefrontal regions was linked and was also associated with activity in brain regions typically responding to threat the right anterior insula and amygdala these results provide first evidence for a prefrontal mechanism that functions to control anxiety after threat offset which may be dysfunctional in patients who suffer from excessive sustained anxiety moreover the results support a model in which the lateral prefrontal cortex controls anxiety related limbic activity through connections with ventromedial prefrontal cortex
Sustained_Threat	through the eyes of anxiety dissecting threat bias via emotional binocular rivalry an extensive body of research has demonstrated that anxious individuals abnormally process threat related content yet the manner in which clinical anxiety affects the selection of threatening signals and their maintenance within consciousness is yet to be explored the present study used an emotional binocular rivalry e procedure in which pictures of faces depicting either fearful or neutral expressions competed with pictures of a house for conscious perception we assumed that first or cumulative preferred perception of faces with fearful over neutral expression i e initial or sustained threat bias respectively stand for preferential selection or maintenance of fear content in awareness correspondingly unmedicated patients with social anxiety disorder and panic disorder were compared to healthy controls for threat related perceptual biases in the e at first perception of face both and patients showed a greater initial threat bias than healthy controls in contrast at cumulative dwell time of face patient groups demonstrated a diminished sustained threat bias relative to healthy controls yet in a different manner patients showed a sustained threat bias though it was smaller than in healthy controls furthermore increased levels of reported anxiety among patients were associated with enhanced sustained perception of neutral faces patients on the other hand showed no sustained threat bias and a diminished cumulative perception of fearful faces with increased levels of anxiety traits these findings indicate that anxiety disorders commonly involve an initially enhanced selection of threat signals into awareness followed by disorder specific manifestation of diminished preferred maintenance of threat in awareness
Sustained_Threat	social threat and novel cage stress induced sustained extracellular regulated kinase num num phosphorylation but differential modulation of brain derived neurotrophic factor expression in the hippocampus of mice the extracellular signal regulated kinase num num pathway has a key role in cell survival and brain plasticity processes that are impaired following exposure to stressful situations we have recently validated two repeated intermittent stress procedures in male mice social threat and repeated exposure to a novel cage which result in clear behavioral effects following num weeks of application the present results demonstrate that both repeated intermittent stress procedures alter the activity of the num pathway in the brain as shown by changes in phosphorylated num phospho num protein expression and in the expression of downstream proteins phosphorylated camp response element binding protein and brain derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus the frontal cortex and the hypothalamus the hippocampus showed greater responsiveness to stress as the two stressors increased phospho num and expression under acute condition following repeated stress hyperphosphorylation of num was associated with up regulation of hippocampal expression in the social threat group but not in mice exposed to novel cage this lack of a pro survival effect of num with repeated novel cage exposure may constitute an early event in stress mediated brain pathology the sustained up regulation in the hippocampi of mice subjected to repeated social threat could be related to rewarding aspects of aggressive interactions suggested by our previous studies
Sustained_Threat	phasic amygdala and activation during the anticipation of temporally unpredictable social observation in social anxiety disorder patients anticipation of potentially threatening social situations is a key process in social anxiety disorder in other anxiety disorders recent research of neural correlates of anticipation of temporally unpredictable threat suggests a temporally dissociable involvement of amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis with phasic amygdala responses and sustained activation however the temporal profile of amygdala and responses during temporal unpredictability of threat has not been investigated in patients suffering from we used functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri to investigate neural activation in the central nucleus of the amygdala cea and the during anticipation of temporally unpredictable aversive video camera observation relative to neutral no camera observation events in patients compared to healthy controls for the analysis of fmri data we applied two regressors phasic sustained within the same model to detect temporally dissociable brain responses the aversive condition induced increased anxiety in patients compared to patients compared to showed increased phasic activation in the cea and the for anticipation of aversive relative to neutral events patients as well as showed sustained activity alterations in the for aversive relative to neutral anticipation no differential activity during sustained threat anticipation in patients compared to was found taken together our study reveals both cea and involvement during threat anticipation in patients the present results point towards potentially specific threat processing marked by elevated phasic but not sustained cea and responses when compared to
Sustained_Threat	expression of freezing and fear potentiated startle during sustained fear in mice fear potentiated acoustic startle paradigms have been used to investigate phasic and sustained components of conditioned fear in rats and humans this study describes a novel training protocol to assess phasic and sustained fear in freely behaving mice using freezing and or fear potentiated startle as measures of fear thereby if needed allowing in vivo application of various techniques such as optogenetics electrophysiology and pharmacological intervention in freely behaving animals an auditory pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm with pseudo randomized conditioned unconditioned stimulus presentations at various durations is combined with repetitive brief auditory white noise burst presentations during fear memory retrieval num h after fear conditioning major findings are that num a motion sensitive platform built on mechano electrical transducers enables measurement of startle responses in freely behaving mice num absence or presence of startle stimuli during retrieval as well as unpredictability of a given threat determine phasic and sustained fear response profiles and num both freezing and startle responses indicate phasic and sustained components of behavioral fear with sustained freezing reflecting unpredictability of conditioned stimulus unconditioned stimulus pairings this paradigm and available genetically modified mouse lines will pave the way for investigation of the molecular and neural mechanisms relating to the transition from phasic to sustained fear
Sustained_Threat	cannabinoid receptors in distinct circuits of the extended amygdala determine fear responsiveness to unpredictable threat the brain circuits underlying behavioral fear have been extensively studied over the last decades although the vast majority of experimental studies assess fear as a transient state of apprehension in response to a discrete threat such phasic states of fear can shift to a sustained anxious apprehension particularly in face of diffuse cues with unpredictable environmental contingencies unpredictability in turn is considered an important variable contributing to anxiety disorders the networks of the extended amygdala have been suggested keys to the control of phasic and sustained states of fear although the underlying synaptic pathways and mechanisms remain poorly understood here we show that the endocannabinoid system acting in synaptic circuits of the extended amygdala can explain the fear response profile during exposure to unpredictable threat using fear training with predictable or unpredictable cues in mice combined with local and cell type specific deficiency and rescue of cannabinoid type num receptors we found that presynaptic receptors on distinct amygdala projections to bed nucleus of the stria terminalis are both necessary and sufficient for the shift from phasic to sustained fear in response to an unpredictable threat these results thereby identify the causal role of a defined protein in a distinct brain pathway for the temporal development of a sustained state of anxious apprehension during unpredictability of environmental influences reminiscent of anxiety symptoms in humans
Sustained_Threat	modulation of sustained fear by transcranial direct current stimulation tdcs of the right inferior frontal cortex rifc downregulation of emotional responses to threat is strongly associated with frontal cortex functions additionally pathological anxiety has been proposed to be associated with the altered frontal control understanding the frontal regulation of both initial and sustained fear responses seems to be crucial for further research on the treatment of anxiety disorders therefore this study aims to examine the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation tdcs over the right inferior frontal cortex rifc on the subjects psychophysiological responses as measured by skin conductance reaction during a sustained threat paradigm num participants were randomly assigned to an anodal and sham stimulation group in a double blinded manner indicated by visual cues participants anticipated the temporally unpredictable occurrence of aversive or neutral auditory stimuli we found a significant interaction effect of condition x tdcs for during the sustained threat post hoc tests revealed a significant reduction in during sustained fear in verum stimulated group the results confirm that tdcs of the rifc attenuates sustained fear this supports the suggested role of the rifc in psychophysiological emotional regulation and the potential use of tdcs to enhance these effects
Sustained_Threat	threat detection behavioral practices in animals and humans in contrast to a perceptible threat that releases freezing fleeing and fighting abstract potential threat elicits anxiety and vigilance the prevalent view is that the larger the animal groups the lower the individual vigilance vigilance is a reflection of anxiety and here we show that anxiety is contagious in grouped social animals in humans anxiety frequently results in rituals that confer a sense of controllability and thereby a means to cope with anxiety accordingly in mental disorders with sustained anxiety rituals predominate the behavior and consequently reduce functionality finally the adaptive value of precautionary behavior including rituals lies in providing individuals with the opportunity to practice defensive means safely and thus to prepare for the eventuality of real danger accordingly the prevalence of anxiety in human and animal behavior accords with the better safe than sorry principle
Sustained_Threat	neurophysiological mechanisms in the emotional modulation of attention the interplay between threat sensitivity and attentional control processing task irrelevant emotional information may compromise attention performance particularly among those showing elevated threat sensitivity if threat sensitive individuals are able to recruit attentional control to inhibit emotional processing however they may show few decrements in attention performance to examine this hypothesis attention performance was measured in three domains alerting orienting and executive attention task irrelevant fearful sad and happy faces were presented for num ms before each trial of the attention task to create a mildly competitive emotional context electroencephalographic recordings were made from num scalp electrodes to generate event related potentials erps to the faces participants reporting high threat sensitivity showed enhanced erps thought to reflect emotional processing and attentional control and enhanced following fearful faces was linked to sustained and even slightly improved executive attention performance reduced conflict interference among high threat sensitive individuals but with decrements in executive attention among low threat sensitive individuals results are discussed in terms of cognitive processing efficiency and the balance between threat sensitivity and attentional control in relation to executive attention performance results may have implications for understanding automatic and voluntary attentional biases related to anxiety
Sustained_Threat	the shape of threat simple geometric forms evoke rapid and sustained capture of attention previous work has indicated that simple geometric shapes underlying facial expressions are capable of conveying emotional meaning specifically a series of studies found that a simple shape a downward pointing which is similar to the geometric configuration of the face in angry expressions is perceived as threatening parallel line of research has determined that threatening stimuli more readily capture attention in five experiments the authors sought to determine whether this preferential processing was also present for the simple geometric form of a downward pointing using a visual search paradigm across these experiments the authors found that when embedded in a field of other shapes downward pointing s were detected faster and in some cases more accurately than identical shapes pointing upward these findings indicate that the meaning of threat can be conveyed rapidly with minimal stimulus detail in addition in some cases during trials of homogeneous fields of stimuli fields of downward pointing s led to slower response times suggesting that this shape s ability to capture attention may also extend to difficulty in disengaging attention as well
Sustained_Threat	cerebral blood flow in immediate and sustained anxiety the goal of this study was to compare cerebral blood flow changes associated with phasic cued fear versus those associated with sustained contextual anxiety positron emission tomography images of were acquired using num in num healthy human subjects as they anticipated unpleasant electric shocks that were administered predictably signaled by a visual cue or unpredictably threatened by the context presentation of the cue in either threat condition was associated with increased in the left amygdala cue that specifically predicted the shock was associated with increases in the ventral prefrontal cortex hypothalamus anterior cingulate cortex left insula and bilateral putamen the sustained threat context increased in the right hippocampus mid cingulate gyrus subgenual midbrain periaqueductal gray thalamus bilateral ventral striatum and parieto occipital cortex this study showed distinct neuronal networks involved in cued fear and contextual anxiety underlying the importance of this distinction for studies on the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders
Sustained_Threat	neuroimaging the temporal dynamics of human avoidance to sustained threat many forms of human psychopathology are characterized by sustained negative emotional responses to threat and chronic behavioral avoidance implicating avoidance as a potential transdiagnostic factor evidence from both nonhuman neurophysiological and human neuroimaging studies suggests a distributed frontal limbic striatal brain network supports avoidance however our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the network to sustained threat that prompts sustained avoidance is limited to address this issue num adults were given extensive training on a modified free operant avoidance task in which button pressing avoided money loss during a sustained threat period subsequently subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while completing the avoidance task in our regions of interest we observed phasic rather than sustained activation during sustained threat in dorsolateral and inferior frontal regions anterior and dorsal cingulate ventral striatum and regions associated with emotion including the amygdala insula substantia nigra and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis complex moreover trait levels of experiential avoidance were negatively correlated with insula hippocampal and amygdala activation these findings suggest knowledge that one can consistently avoid aversive outcomes is not associated with decreased threat related responses and that individuals with greater experiential avoidance exhibit reduced reactivity to initial threat implications for understanding brain mechanisms supporting human avoidance and psychological theories of avoidance are discussed
Sustained_Threat	phasic vs sustained fear in rats and humans role of the extended amygdala in fear vs anxiety data will be reviewed using the acoustic startle reflex in rats and humans based on our attempts to operationally define fear vs anxiety although the symptoms of fear and anxiety are very similar they also differ fear is a generally adaptive state of apprehension that begins rapidly and dissipates quickly once the threat is removed phasic fear anxiety is elicited by less specific and less predictable threats or by those that are physically or psychologically more distant thus anxiety is a more long lasting state of apprehension sustained fear rodent studies suggest that phasic fear is mediated by the amygdala which sends outputs to the hypothalamus and brainstem to produce symptoms of fear sustained fear is also mediated by the amygdala which releases corticotropin releasing factor a stress hormone that acts on receptors in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis a part of the so called extended amygdala the amygdala and send outputs to the same hypothalamic and brainstem targets to produce phasic and sustained fear respectively in rats sustained fear is more sensitive to anxiolytic drugs in humans symptoms of clinical anxiety are better detected in sustained rather than phasic fear paradigms
Sustained_Threat	the neural basis of improved cognitive performance by threat of shock anxiety can have both detrimental and facilitatory cognitive effects this study investigates the neural substrates of a replicated facilitatory effect of anxiety on sustained attention and response inhibition this effect consisted of improved performance on the sustained attention to response task a go nogo task consisting of num go and num nogo trials in threat unpredictable electrical shock vs safe no shock conditions this study uses the same experimental design with fmri and relies on an event related analysis of signal changes findings reveal that threat related cognitive facilitation improved nogo accuracy is associated with greater activation of a right lateralized frontoparietal group of regions previously implicated in sustained attention and response inhibition moreover these same regions show decreased activation in the go trials preceding nogo errors during nogo trials striatal activity is also greater in the threat vs safe condition consistent with the notion of enhanced inhibitory processing under threat these findings identify potential mechanisms by which threat of unpredictable shock can facilitate distinct cognitive functions greater understanding of the complex interaction of the anxious state and cognitive processes may have critical clinical implications
Sustained_Threat	uncertainty is associated with increased selective attention and sustained stimulus processing uncertainty about future threat has been found to be associated with an overestimation of threat probability and is hypothesized to elicit additional allocation of attention we used event related potentials to examine uncertainty related dynamics in attentional allocation exploiting brain potentials high temporal resolution and sensitivity to attention thirty participants performed a picture viewing task in which cues indicated the subsequent picture valence certain neutral and a certain aversive cue accurately predicted subsequent picture valence whereas an uncertain cue did not participants overestimated the effective frequency of aversive pictures following the uncertain cue both during and after the task signifying expectancy and covariation biases and they tended to express lower subjective valences for aversive pictures presented after the uncertain cue pictures elicited increased and amplitudes when their valence could not be predicted from the cue for the this effect was more pronounced in response to neutral pictures uncertainty appears to enhance the engagement of early phasic and sustained attention for uncertainly cued targets thus defensive motivation related to uncertainty about future threat elicits specific attentional dynamics implicating prioritization at various processing stages especially for nonthreatening stimuli that tend to violate expectations
Sustained_Threat	affective primes suppress attention bias to threat in socially anxious individuals anxious individuals show an attention bias towards threatening information however under conditions of sustained environmental threat this otherwise present attention bias disappears it remains unclear whether this suppression of attention bias can be caused by a transient activation of the fear system in the present experiment high socially anxious and low socially anxious individuals group n num group n num performed a modified dot probe task in which they were shown either a neutral or socially threatening prime word prior to each trial was collected and components to the prime and faces displays were computed individuals showed an attention bias to threat after a neutral prime but no attention bias after a threatening prime demonstrating that suppression of attention bias can occur after a transient activation of the fear system individuals showed an opposite pattern no evidence of a bias to threat with neutral primes but induction of an attention bias to threat following threatening primes results suggested differential processing of the prime and faces displays by and individuals however no group by prime interaction was found for any of components
Sustained_Threat	electrocortical evidence for rapid allocation of attention to threat in the dot probe task threatening stimuli have been shown to preferentially capture attention using a range of tasks and measures however attentional bias to threat has not typically been found in unselected individuals using behavioral measures in the dot probe task one of the most common ways of examining attention to threat the present study leveraged event related potentials erps in conjunction with behavioral measures in the dot probe task to examine whether more direct measures of attention might reveal an attentional bias to threat in unselected individuals as in previous dot probe studies we found no evidence of an attentional bias to threat using reaction time additionally this measure exhibited poor internal reliability in contrast erps revealed an initial shift of attention to threat related stimuli reflected by the npc which showed moderate internal reliability however there was no evidence of sustained engagement with the threat related stimuli as measured by the late positive potential together these results demonstrate that unselected individuals do initially allocate attention to threat in the dot probe task and further that this bias is better characterized by neural measures of attention than traditional behavioral measures these results have implications for the study of attention to threat in both unselected and anxious populations
Sustained_Threat	risk avoidant decision making increased by threat of electric shock threat cues elicit defensive reactions mediated by limbic brain circuitry that is also implicated in risk sensitive decision making building upon research looking at stress effects on decision making a gambling task was administered to num healthy adults comparing decision making on trials on which a red screen background signalled threat of shocks against trials when shocks could not occur the threat cues elicited increased electrodermal activity and a sustained decrease in heart rate consistent with defensive vigilance the threat condition was associated with risk avoidant choices on trials where the risky option involved moderate losses and when choosing between options involving only losses these effects were not explained by changes in latency threat exerts immediate effects on decision making and physiological arousal biasing subjects towards safer alternatives potentially through a magnified processing of loss information
Sustained_Threat	escape the bear and fall to the lion the impact of avoidance availability on threat acquisition and extinction pervasive avoidance behaviour is a core feature of anxiety disorders however little is known about how the availability of avoidance modulates learned threat responding to assess this question we recorded avoidance behaviour electrodermal activity and expectancy ratings in num healthy participants during an associative learning paradigm with embedded unavoidable and avoidable trials when avoidance was available we observed greater avoidance behaviour for threat versus safety cues as well as reduced differential skin conductance responses for unavoidable threat versus safety cues when avoidance was unavailable as during the extinction phase we observed sustained differential skin conductance responses for threat versus safety cues for all phases we found greater expectancy ratings for threat versus safe cues furthermore greater avoidance behaviour predicted larger differential skin conductance responses to threat versus safety cues during extinction overall the results show that the conditioned response is attenuated during situations where avoidance is available but it recovers when avoidance is unavailable subsequently prolonging threat extinction
Sustained_Threat	network organization unfolds over time during periods of anxious anticipation entering a state of anxious anticipation triggers widespread changes across large scale networks in the brain the temporal aspects of this transition into an anxious state are poorly understood to address this question an instructed threat of shock paradigm was used while recording functional in humans to measure how activation and functional connectivity change over time across the salience executive and task negative networks and how they interact with key regions implicated in emotional processing the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis transitions into threat blocks were associated with transient responses in regions of the salience network and sustained responses in a putative site among others multivariate network measures of communication were computed revealing changes to network organization during transient and sustained periods of threat too for example the salience network exhibited a transient increase in network efficiency followed by a period of sustained decreased efficiency the amygdala became more central to network function as assessed via betweenness centrality during threat across all participants and the extent to which the became more central during threat depended on self reported anxiety together our study unraveled a progression of responses and network level changes due to sustained threat in particular our results reveal how network organization unfolds with time during periods of anxious anticipation
Sustained_Threat	differences in startle modulation during instructed threat and selective attention this study investigated whether attentional processes contribute to fear potentiated startle ten subjects participated in a threat of shock experiment and an attentional control condition in the threat of shock experiment visual cues indicated whether or not an aversive shock might occur in the attentional control the shocks were replaced by faint vibrotactile stimuli that had to be counted the amplitudes of the evoked by the visual cues did not differ under threat and counting which suggested that both conditions engaged attention to the same extent in contrast startle potentiation in the threat condition was an order of magnitude larger than the marginally significant attentional startle facilitation in the counting condition these results indicate that an attentional contribution to fear potentiated startle under the present experimental conditions is small in addition contextual effects of threat of shock became manifest as baseline startle was facilitated relative to the attention condition this may reflect a more sustained state of anxiety on which cue specific fear responses are superimposed
Sustained_Threat	measuring anxious responses to predictable and unpredictable threat in children and adolescents research has highlighted the need for new methods to assess emotions in children on multiple levels to gain better insight into the complex processes of emotional development the startle reflex is a unique translational tool that has been used to study physiological processes during fear and anxiety in rodents and in human participants however it has been challenging to implement developmentally appropriate startle experiments in children this article describes a procedure that uses predictable and unpredictable aversive events to distinguish between phasic fear and sustained anxiety in children and adolescents we investigated anxious responses as measured with the startle reflex in youths num mean age num num years range num num across three conditions no aversive events predictable aversive events and unpredictable aversive events short duration cues were presented several times in each condition aversive events were signaled by the cues in the condition but were presented randomly in the condition participants showed fear potentiated startle to the threat cue in the condition startle responses were also elevated between cues in the condition compared with the condition suggesting that unpredictable aversive events can evoke a sustained state of anxiety in youths this latter effect was influenced by sex being greater in girls than in boys these findings indicate the feasibility of this experimental induction of the startle reflex in response to predictable and unpredictable events in children and adolescents enabling future research on interindividual differences in fear and anxiety and their development in youths
Sustained_Threat	neural evidence for the threat detection advantage differential attention allocation to angry and happy faces threat stimuli are considered to be processed with higher priority due to an automatic threat detection system that enables rapid shifts of attention however direct evidence is still missing the present study used the face in the crowd task and event related potentials to find evidence for the functionality of attention shifts in threat detection the threat detection advantage was replicated in the behavioral results an npc was observed that was more pronounced and earlier for angry compared to happy faces suggesting differential attention allocation underlying the threat detection advantage larger sustained posterior contralateral negativity indicated that angry faces also gained more enhanced subsequent processing an early posterior negativity observed num ms after stimulus onset revealed early emotion specific processing that may have caused differences in attention allocation toward threatening stimuli
Sustained_Threat	phasic and sustained fear in humans elicits distinct patterns of brain activity aversive events are typically more debilitating when they occur unpredictably than predictably studies in humans and animals indicate that predictable and unpredictable aversive events can induce phasic and sustained fear respectively research in rodents suggests that anatomically related but distinct neural circuits may mediate phasic and sustained fear we explored this issue in humans by examining threat predictability in three virtual reality contexts one in which electric shocks were predictably signaled by a cue a second in which shocks occurred unpredictably but never paired with a cue and a third in which no shocks were delivered evidence of threat induced phasic and sustained fear was presented using fear ratings and skin conductance utilizing recent advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri we were able to conduct whole brain fmri at relatively high spatial resolution and still have enough sensitivity to detect transient and sustained signal changes in the basal forebrain we found that both predictable and unpredictable threat evoked transient activity in the dorsal amygdala but that only unpredictable threat produced sustained activity in a forebrain region corresponding to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis complex consistent with animal models hypothesizing a role for the cortex in generating sustained fear sustained signal increases to unpredictable threat were also found in anterior insula and a frontoparietal cortical network associated with hypervigilance in addition unpredictable threat led to transient activity in the ventral amygdala hippocampal area and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex as well as transient activation and subsequent deactivation of subgenual anterior cingulate cortex limbic structures that have been implicated in the regulation of emotional behavior and stress responses in line with basic findings in rodents these results provide evidence that phasic and sustained fear in humans may manifest similar signs of distress but appear to be associated with different patterns of neural activity in the human basal forebrain
Sustained_Threat	distinct phasic and sustained brain responses and connectivity of amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis during threat anticipation in panic disorder panic disorder patients are constantly concerned about future panic attacks and exhibit general hypersensitivity to unpredictable threat we aimed to reveal phasic and sustained brain responses and functional connectivity of the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis during threat anticipation in using functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri we investigated num patients and num healthy controls during anticipation of temporally unpredictable aversive and neutral sounds we used a phasic and sustained analysis model to disentangle temporally dissociable brain activations patients compared with showed phasic amygdala and sustained responses during anticipation of aversive v neutral stimuli furthermore increased phasic activation was observed in anterior cingulate cortex insula and prefrontal cortex insula and also showed sustained activation functional connectivity analyses revealed partly distinct phasic and sustained networks we demonstrate a role for the during unpredictable threat anticipation in and provide first evidence for dissociation between phasic amygdala and sustained activation and their functional connectivity in line with a hypersensitivity to uncertainty in our results suggest time dependent involvement of brain regions related to fear and anxiety
Sustained_Threat	amygdala responses to averted vs direct gaze fear vary as a function of presentation speed we examined whether amygdala responses to rapidly presented fear expressions are preferentially tuned to averted vs direct gaze fear and conversely whether responses to more sustained presentations are preferentially tuned to direct vs averted gaze fear we conducted three functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri studies to test these predictions including study num a block design employing sustained presentations num s of averted vs direct gaze fear expressions taken from the pictures of facial affect study num a block design employing rapid presentations num ms of these same stimuli and study num a direct replication of these studies in the context of a single experiment using stimuli selected from the nimstim emotional face stimuli together these studies provide evidence consistent with an early reflexive amygdala response tuned to clear threat and a later reflective response tuned to ambiguous threat

Sustained_Threat	emerging viruses and current strategies for vaccine intervention during the past decade several notable viruses have suddenly emerged from obscurity or anonymity to become serious global health threats provoking concern regarding their sustained epidemic transmission in immunologically naive human populations with each new threat comes the call for rapid vaccine development indeed vaccines are considered a critical component of disease prevention for emerging viral infections because in many cases other medical options are limited or non existent or that infections result in such a rapid clinical deterioration that the effectiveness of therapeutics is limited while classic approaches to vaccine development are still amenable to emerging viruses the application of molecular techniques in virology has profoundly influenced our understanding of virus biology and vaccination methods based on replicating attenuated and non replicating virus vector approaches have become useful vaccine platforms together with a growing understanding of viral disease emergence a range of vaccine strategies and international commitment to underpin development vaccine intervention for new and emerging viruses may become a possibility
Sustained_Threat	the impact of emotional states on cognitive control circuitry and function typically in the laboratory cognitive and emotional processes are studied separately or as a stream of fleeting emotional stimuli embedded within a cognitive task yet in life thoughts and actions often occur in more lasting emotional states of arousal the current study examines the impact of emotions on actions using a novel behavioral paradigm and functional neuroimaging to assess cognitive control under sustained states of threat anticipation of an aversive noise and excitement anticipation of winning money thirty eight healthy adult participants were scanned while performing an emotional go no go task with positive happy faces negative fearful faces and neutral calm faces emotional cues under threat or excitement cognitive control performance was enhanced during the excited state relative to a nonarousing control condition this enhanced performance was paralleled by heightened activity of frontoparietal and frontostriatal circuitry in contrast under persistent threat cognitive control was diminished when the valence of the emotional cue conflicted with the emotional state successful task performance in this conflicting emotional condition was associated with increased activity in the posterior cingulate cortex a default mode network region implicated in complex processes such as processing emotions in the context of self and monitoring performance this region showed positive coupling with frontoparietal circuitry implicated in cognitive control providing support for a role of the posterior cingulate cortex in mobilizing cognitive resources to improve performance these findings suggest that emotional states of arousal differentially modulate cognitive control and point to the potential utility of this paradigm for understanding effects of situational and pathological states of arousal on behavior
