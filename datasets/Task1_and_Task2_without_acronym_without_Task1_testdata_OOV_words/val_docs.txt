Acute_Threat_Fear	philosophical reflections on narrative and deep brain stimulation deep brain stimulation has in some cases been associated with significant psychological effects and or personality change these effects occur sometimes as acute changes experienced intraoperatively or during the initial setting of the stimulator and sometimes as longer term progressive changes in the months following surgery sometimes they are the intended outcome of treatment and in other cases they are an unintended side effect in all of these circumstances some patients and caregivers have described the psychological effects of as frightening or disconcerting trace the source of these negative reactions to the fear that stimulation related psychological and personality changes represent a threat to personal identity and agency this issue has implications both for philosophical theories of personal identity and agency and for clinical concerns narrative account of personal identity is developed to illuminate the nature of the threat to identity and agency potentially poses and to suggest steps that might be taken to mitigate and avoid these threats
Acute_Threat_Fear	hydrocortisone suppression of the fear potentiated startle response and posttraumatic stress disorder this study examined the effects of oral administration of mg hydrocortisone on baseline and fear potentiated startle in num male veterans with or without the procedure was based on a two session within subject design in which acoustic startle eyeblink responses were recorded during intervals of threat or no threat of electric shock results showed that the magnitude of the difference between startle responses recorded during anticipation of imminent shock compared to safe periods was reduced after hydrocortisone administration relative to placebo this effect did not vary as a function of group nor were there were any significant group differences in other indices startle amplitude findings suggest that the acute elevations in systemic cortisol produced by hydrocortisone administration may have fear inhibiting effects this finding may have implications for understanding the role of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis function in vulnerability and resilience to traumatic stress
Acute_Threat_Fear	acute tryptophan depletion increases translational indices of anxiety but not fear serotonergic modulation of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis serotonin is strongly implicated in the mammalian stress response but surprisingly little is known about its mode of action recent data suggest that serotonin can inhibit aversive responding in humans but this remains underspecified in particular data in rodents suggest that global serotonin depletion may specifically increase long duration bed nucleus of the stria terminalis mediated aversive responses ie anxiety but not short duration independent responses ie fear here we extend these findings to humans in a balanced placebo controlled crossover design healthy volunteers n num received a controlled diet with and without the serotonin precursor tryptophan acute tryptophan depletion aversive states were indexed by translational acoustic startle measures fear and anxiety were operationally defined as the increase in startle reactivity during short and long duration threat periods evoked by predictable shock fear potentiated startle and by the context in which the shocks were administered anxiety potentiated startle respectively significantly increased long duration anxiety potentiated startle but had no effect on short duration fear potentiated startle these results suggest that serotonin depletion in humans selectively increases anxiety but not fear current translational frameworks support the proposition that thus disinhibits dorsal raphe originating serotonergic control of corticotropin releasing hormone mediated excitation of the this generates a candidate neuropharmacological mechanism by which depleted serotonin may increase response to sustained threats alongside clear implications for our understanding of the manifestation and treatment of mood and anxiety disorders
Acute_Threat_Fear	induction and expression of fear sensitization caused by acute traumatic stress fear promotes adaptive responses to threats however when the level of fear is not proportional to the level of threat maladaptive fear related behaviors characteristic of anxiety disorders result post traumatic stress disorder develops in response to a traumatic event and patients often show sensitized reactions to mild stressors associated with the trauma stress enhanced fear learning is a rodent model of this sensitized responding in which exposure to a num shock stressor nonassociatively enhances subsequent fear conditioning training with only a single trial we examined the role of corticosterone in administration of the synthesis blocker metyrapone prior to the stressor but not at time points after attenuated moreover co administered with metyrapone rescued however alone without the stressor was not sufficient to produce in these same animals we then looked for correlates of in terms of changes in excitatory receptor expression western blot analysis of the basolateral amygdala revealed an increase in the glua receptor subunit that correlated with thus is permissive to trauma induced changes in function
Acute_Threat_Fear	association between problematic alcohol use and reactivity to uncertain threat in two independent samples recent laboratory studies have shown that acute alcohol intoxication selectively and effectively dampens aversive responding to uncertain threat an emerging hypothesis is that individuals who exhibit heightened reactivity to uncertain threat may be especially motivated to use alcohol to dampen their distress setting the stage for negative reinforcement processes to drive excessive alcohol use however no study to date has directly examined whether current problematic drinkers exhibit heightened reactivity to uncertain threat as would be expected the present study was therefore designed to examine the association between current problematic alcohol use and reactivity to uncertain threat during sobriety in two independent samples in study num n num and study num n num adult participants completed the same well validated threat of shock task which separately probes responses to temporally predictable and unpredictable threat startle potentiation was measured as an index of aversive responding problematic alcohol use was defined as number of binge episodes within the past days in study num and total scores on a self report measure of hazardous drinking in study num as hypothesized across both studies greater levels of problematic drinking were associated with greater startle potentiation to unpredictable threat in study num hazardous drinking scores were also positively associated with startle potentiation to predictable threat the findings are notably consistent with the notion that heightened reactivity to uncertain threat is an important individual difference factor associated with the onset and or maintenance of problematic drinking behaviors and may therefore be a novel prevention and intervention target
Acute_Threat_Fear	onset and offset of aversive events establish distinct memories requiring fear and reward networks two things are worth remembering about an aversive event what made it happen what made it cease if a stimulus precedes an aversive event it becomes a signal for threat and will later elicit behavior indicating conditioned fear however if the stimulus is presented upon cessation of the aversive event it elicits behavior indicating conditioned relief what are the neuronal bases for such learning using functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri in humans we found that a fear conditioned stimulus activates amygdala but not striatum whereas a relief conditioned stimulus activates striatum but not amygdala correspondingly acute inactivation of amygdala or of ventral striatum in rats respectively abolished only conditioned fear or only conditioned relief thus the behaviorally opponent memories supported by onset and offset of aversive events engage and require fear and reward networks respectively this may explain attraction to stimuli associated with the cessation of trauma or of panic attacks
Acute_Threat_Fear	the perceived threat of the risk for graft rejection and health related quality of life among organ transplant recipients this study was primarily aimed for developing and testing a valid and reliable instrument that measures perceived threat of the risk for graft rejection after organ transplantation second aim was to report descriptive data regarding graft rejection and health related quality of life the most serious risk connected with transplantations besides infection is graft rejection non experimental descriptive involving instrument development and psychometric assessment questionnaires about perceived threat of the risk for graft rejection and health related quality of life were mailed to num otrs between num num years old the items were formed from a previous interview study patients were transplanted with a kidney a liver or a heart and or a lung all patients with follow up time of one year three months and three years three months were included with an num response rate the study comprised of num otrs who had received either a kidney n num a liver n num or heart or lung n num three homogenous factors of perceived threat for graft rejection were revealed labelled intrusive anxiety graft related threat and lack of control tests of internal consistency showed good item scale convergent and discriminatory validity majority of the otrs scored low levels for intrusive anxiety the kidney transplant recipients experienced more graft related threat by acute graft rejection than those transplanted with a liver heart or lung in conclusion this study suggests that it is possible to measure the perceived threat of the risk for graft rejection in three homogenous factors relevance to clinical practice the instrument perceived threat of the risk for graft rejection might be usable to measure the impact of fear of graft rejection to predict needs of pedagogical intervention strategies to reduce fear and to improve health related quality of life related to graft rejection
Acute_Threat_Fear	nicotine disrupts safety learning by enhancing fear associated with a safety cue via the dorsal hippocampus learned safety a learning process in which a cue becomes associated with the absence of threat is disrupted in individuals with post traumatic stress disorder bi directional relationship exists between smoking and and one potential explanation is that nicotine associated changes in cognition facilitate emotional dysregulation by disrupting safety associations therefore we investigated whether nicotine would disrupt learned safety by enhancing fear associated with a safety cue in the present study num mice were administered acute or chronic nicotine and trained over three days in a differential backward trace conditioning paradigm consisting of five trials of a forward conditioned stimulus light co terminating with a footshock unconditioned stimulus followed by a backward tone presented num s after cessation of the unconditioned stimulus summation testing found that acute nicotine disrupted learned safety but chronic nicotine had no effect another group of animals administered acute nicotine showed fear when presented with the backward light alone indicating the formation of a maladaptive fear association with the backward finally we investigated the brain regions involved by administering nicotine directly into the dorsal hippocampus ventral hippocampus and prelimbic cortex infusion of nicotine into the dorsal hippocampus disrupted safety learning
Arousal	toward an understanding of the influence of affective states on attentional tuning comment on friedman and forster num friedman and forster num reviewed an extensive program of research that was consistent with the view that positive affective states broaden whereas negative affective states narrow the scope of attention we applaud their creative investigations into these important psychological questions and appreciate their thorough review however recent evidence strongly suggests that the conclusions drawn by friedman and forster need to be tempered for the recent evidence suggests that motivational intensity rather than affective valence causes the modulations of attentional tuning that is affective states of low motivational intensity e g sadness postgoal positive affect broaden attention whereas affective states of high motivational intensity e g disgust pregoal positive affect narrow attention our viewpoint is that attentional narrowing occurs during affective states of high motivational intensity to aid organisms in acquiring desirable objects and avoiding aversive ones attentional broadening occurs during affective states of low motivational intensity to open organisms to new opportunities
Arousal	momentary affective states are associated with momentary volume prospective trends and fluctuation of daily physical activity several interventions aiming to enhance physical activity in everyday life showed mixed effects affective constructs are thought to potentially support health behavior change however little is known about within subject associations between momentary affect and subsequent physical activity in everyday life this study analyzed the extent to which three dimensions of affective states valence calmness and energetic arousal were associated with different components of daily activity trajectories sixty five undergraduates students age num num num num females num participated in this study physical activity was assessed objectively through accelerometers during num h affective states assessments were conducted randomly every num min using an e diary with a six item mood scale that was especially designed for ambulatory assessment we conducted three level multi level analyses to investigate the extent to which momentary affect accounted for momentary volume prospective trends and stability vs fluctuation of physical activity in everyday life all three affect dimensions were significantly associated with momentary activity volumes and prospective trends over num min periods physical activity didn t fluctuate freely but featured significant autocorrelation across repeated measurements suggesting some stability of physical activity across num min assessments after adjusting for the autoregressive structure in physical activity assessments only energetic arousal remained a significant predictor feeling energized and awake was associated with an increased momentary volume of activity and initially smaller but gradually growing decreases in subsequent activity within the subsequent num min although not related to trends in physical activity higher valence predicted lower stability in physical activity across subsequent num min suggesting more short term fluctuations in daily activity the more participants reported positive affective valence the current analyses afford interesting insight into within subject associations between momentary affect and activity trajectories in everyday life energetic arousal emerged as the only meaningful predictor of physical activity in daily life after adjusting for autoregression significant effect of valence on short term activity fluctuations might indicate that activity interventions would benefit from taking into account enhancement of positive affective valence in everyday life moments of enhanced valence may scaffold attempts helping inactive people to get started with daily activities and overcome periods of inactivity in everyday life
Arousal	using pupil size and heart rate to infer affective states during behavioral neurophysiology and neuropsychology experiments nonhuman primates nhps are a valuable research model because of their behavioral physiological and neuroanatomical similarities to humans in the absence of language autonomic activity can provide crucial information about cognitive and affective states during single unit recording inactivation and lesion studies methods standardized for use in humans are not easily adapted to nhps and detailed guidance has been lacking we provide guidance for monitoring heart rate and pupil size in the behavioral neurophysiology setting by addressing the methodological issues pitfalls and solutions for studies the methods are based on comparative physiology to establish a rationale for each solution we include examples from both electrophysiological and lesion studies single unit recording pupil responses and heart rate changes represent a range of decreasing temporal resolution a characteristic that impacts experimental design and analysis we demonstrate the unexpected result that autonomic measures acquired before and after amygdala lesions are comparable despite disruption of normal autonomic function species and study design differences can render standard techniques used in human studies inappropriate for studies we show how to manage data from small groups typical of studies data from the short behavioral trials typical of neurophysiological studies issues associated with longitudinal studies and differences in anatomy and physiology autonomic measurement to infer cognitive and affective states in is neither off the shelf nor onerous familiarity with the issues and solutions will broaden the use of autonomic signals in single unit and lesion studies
Arousal	affective and situational precipitants of smoking lapses among adolescents introduction most adolescent smokers report a desire to quit and many have made several unsuccessful quit attempts however when adolescents attempt to quit they often resume smoking quickly this ecological study aimed to num characterize affective and situational precipitants of smoking lapses among adolescents and num explore the moderating influence of nicotine dependence severity on lapse precipitants methods adolescent daily smokers n num ages num num years completed electronic diaries of cigarettes smoked craving and affective states and situational variables on handheld computers in their natural environment for two weeks following an unassisted quit attempt on average adolescents were moderately nicotine dependent modified fagerstrom tolerance questionnaire mftq score num num num num results craving was a significant episodic cue for lapse and stable influence on lapse relating to num and num increased odds of lapse respectively high arousal affective states regardless of valence were associated with num num increased odds of lapse low arousal positive affective states were associated with num decreased odds of lapse num unit difference in a teen s mftq score related to num increased odds of lapse but dependence severity did not moderate proximal lapse influences conclusions this report provides some of the first ecological data characterizing adolescent smoking lapses following a quit attempt as in prior work with teens lapses were nearly universal and quickly followed the quit attempt specific situational and affective contexts of smoking lapses for adolescents were implicated indicating the need for cessation interventions to address craving and high arousal affective states as precipitators of lapse in this high risk group implications this report provides some of the first ecological data characterizing smoking lapses among teens attempting to quit smoking on their own like adults adolescents face many barriers when making quit attempts the present work provides ecological data to suggest that the experience of heightened arousal in teens daily lives interferes with their efforts to quit smoking thus this work highlights the importance of affective dysregulation or amplitude of emotional feelings for teen smoking lapses moment to moment fluctuation in craving was also implicated as a dynamic precipitator of smoking lapse in this high risk group
Arousal	the association between short periods of everyday life activities and affective states replication study using ambulatory assessment regularly conducted exercise programs effectively influence affective states studies suggest that this is also true for short bouts of physical activity of num min or less accordingly everyday life activities of short duration might be used to regulate affective states however this association has rarely been studied in reference to unstructured activities in ongoing real life situations the current study examined the influence of various everyday life activities on three dimensions of mood valence calmness energetic arousal in a predominantly inactive sample ambulatory assessment was used to investigate the association between actual and affective states during the course of num day seventy seven students ages num num participated in the study was assessed with accelerometers and affective state assessments were conducted hourly using an e diary with a six item mood scale that was specially designed for multilevel analyses indicated that the mood dimensions energetic arousal p num num and valence p num num were positively influenced by the intensity of the activity carried out in the num min prior to the assessment as their activity increased the participants positive feelings and energetic arousal increased however the students calmness was not affected by their activity levels the findings highlight the importance of integrating short activity intervals of num min or less into everyday life routines to improve affective states
Arousal	decoding the neural representation of affective states brain activity was monitored while participants viewed picture sets that reflected high or low levels of arousal and positive neutral or negative valence pictures within a set were presented rapidly in an incidental viewing task while fmri data were collected the primary purpose of the study was to determine if multi voxel pattern analysis could be used within and between participants to predict valence arousal and combined affective states elicited by pictures based on distributed patterns of whole brain activity secondary purpose was to determine if distributed patterns of whole brain activity can be used to derive a lower dimensional representation of affective states consistent with behavioral data results demonstrated above chance prediction of valence arousal and affective states that was robust across a wide range of number of voxels used in prediction additionally individual differences multidimensional scaling based on fmri data clearly separated valence and arousal levels and was consistent with a circumplex model of affective states

Frustrative_Nonreward	no sex differences in the origins of covariation between social and physical aggression prior work has indicated both theoretical and empirical overlap between social and physical aggression the extent to which their covariance can be explained by the same underlying genetic or environmental factors however remains unclear it is also uncertain whether or how the origins of their covariance might vary across sex the current study sought to fill these gaps in the literature we examined maternal and teacher reports of youth physical and social aggression in over num num num years old mean age num num years twin pairs from the michigan state university twin registry we made use of the bivariate correlated factors model to clarify the origins of their association we further tested both sex difference and no sex difference versions of that model to determine whether there are sex differences in the association between social and physical aggression as often assumed the covariation between social and physical aggression was due to overlapping genetic factors and common environmental conditions specifically num num of the genetic factors num num of the shared environmental factors and num num of the unique environmental factors influencing physical aggression also influenced social aggression according to both mother and teacher reports these shared etiological factors did not differ across sex these findings argue against the common assumption that social aggression is the female version of male physical aggression and instead suggest that social aggression may be best conceptualized as a form of antisocial behavior that shares developmental pathways with other manifestations of externalizing pathology
Frustrative_Nonreward	methodological study of order effects in reporting relational aggression experiences unlike the overt nature of physical aggression which lends itself to simpler and more direct methods of investigation the often masked nature of relational aggression has led to difficulties and debate regarding the most effective tools of study given concerns with the accuracy of third party relational aggression reports especially as individuals age self report measures may be particularly useful when assessing experiences with relational aggression however it is important to recognize validity concerns in particular the potential effects of item order presentation associated with self report of relational aggression perpetration and victimization to investigate this issue surveys were administered and completed by num young adults randomly assigned to one of four survey conditions reflecting manipulation of item order survey conditions included presentation of a perpetration items only b victimization items only c perpetration items followed by victimization items and d victimization items followed by perpetration items results revealed that participants reported perpetrating relational aggression significantly more often when asked only about perpetration or when asked about perpetration before victimization compared with participants who were asked about victimization before perpetration item order manipulation did not result in significant differences in self reported victimization experiences results of this study indicate a need for greater consideration of item order when conducting research using self report data and the importance of additional investigation into which form of item presentation elicits the most accurate self report information
Frustrative_Nonreward	applying social cognitive theory to explore relational aggression across early adolescence within and between person analysis in the past two decades there has been a significant amount of research on children s relational aggression which has been found to be associated with psychosocial problems longitudinal studies have examined changes in relational aggression during early adolescence in relation to individual characteristics however most studies compare individual differences between people with regard to rates of relational aggression shortcoming to the current literature is the lack of studies that use a multilevel approach to examine individual differences between person as well as the extent to which individuals deviate from their own typical levels within person over time in this study within and between person psychological and peer related predictors of rates of relational aggression over time were examined participants included num num students in th th grade mean age num num from four public middle schools in the midwest which consisted num females and num males in terms of race and ethnicity num num num were african americans followed by num num num whites and num num others longitudinal data were collected over four waves across two years of middle school the findings indicated that contrary to the hypothesis that relational aggression would increase over time there was no significant growth across time age gender and race were not associated with relational aggression over time however consistent with the social cognitive theory changes in within person impulsivity anger and peer delinquency were all positively related to increases in relational aggression at the between person level of analysis depressive symptoms and peer delinquency were related to relational aggression findings suggest that school based programs that address anger management impulsivity empathy and victimization could help prevent relational aggression
Frustrative_Nonreward	boys and girls relational and physical aggression in nine countries distinguishing between relational and physical aggression has become a key feature of many developmental studies in north america and western europe but very little information is available on relational and physical aggression in more diverse cultural contexts this study examined the factor structure of associations between and gender differences in relational and physical aggression in china colombia italy jordan kenya the philippines sweden thailand and the united states children ages num num years num num reported on their relationally and physically aggressive behavior relational and physical aggression shared a common factor structure across countries in all nine countries relational and physical aggression were significantly correlated average r num countries differed in the mean levels of both relational and physical aggression that children reported using and with respect to whether children reported using more physical than relational aggression or more relational than physical aggression boys reported being more physically aggressive than girls across all nine countries no consistent gender differences emerged in relational aggression despite mean level differences in relational and physical aggression across countries the findings provided support for cross country similarities in associations between relational and physical aggression as well as links between gender and aggression

Loss	chocolate cake guilt or celebration associations with healthy eating attitudes perceived behavioural control intentions and weight loss food and eating are often associated with ambivalent feelings pleasure and enjoyment but also worry and guilt guilt has the potential to motivate behaviour change but may also lead to feelings of helplessness and loss of control this study firstly examined whether a default association of either guilt or celebration with a prototypical forbidden food item chocolate cake was related to differences in attitudes perceived behavioural control and intentions in relation to healthy eating and secondly whether the default association was related to weight change over an month period and short term weight loss in a subsample of participants with a weight loss goal this study did not find any evidence for adaptive or motivational properties of guilt participants associating chocolate cake with guilt did not report more positive attitudes or stronger intentions to eat healthy than did those associating chocolate cake with celebration instead they reported lower levels of perceived behavioural control over eating and were less successful at maintaining their weight over an month period participants with a weight loss goal who associated chocolate cake with guilt were less successful at losing weight over a month period compared to those associating chocolate cake with celebration
Loss	disrupting sleep the effects of sleep loss on psychotic experiences tested in an experimental study with mediation analysis our view is that insomnia may be a causal factor in the occurrence of psychotic experiences such as paranoia and hallucinations however the causal relationship is not established the aim of the study was to investigate the causal role of insomnia in psychotic experiences via a sleep restriction manipulation the study was a within subjects crossover design that included a planned mediation analysis sixty eight nonclinical volunteers underwent a sleep loss condition restricted to num h sleep for num nights and a control condition standard sleep in randomized order in num consecutive weeks with a weekend washout period psychotic experiences paranoia hallucinations grandiosity and cognitive disorganization and candidate mediating variables negative affect and related processes working memory decision making and perceptual processing were assessed before and after each condition actigraphy verified an average sleep duration of num h num min in the sleep loss condition vs num h num min in the control condition after the sleep loss condition relative to the control condition participants reported significant increases in paranoia hallucinations and cognitive disorganization with no significant changes in grandiosity the sleep loss condition was also associated with significant increases in negative affect negative self and other cognitions worry and working memory impairment mediation analyses indicated that changes in psychotic experiences were mediated by changes in negative affect and related processes but not memory impairment the overall conclusion is that insomnia has a causal role in the occurrence of certain psychotic experiences and that a key route is via negative affect

Loss	the impact of perinatal death on nurses and their coping strategies nurses are expected to care for grieving women and families suffering from perinatal loss however these losses can also significantly impact upon the emotional state of nurses failure to adjust may endanger the affected nurse s health and render him or her unable or unwilling to provide continuous quality care there has been little prior research addressing the effect of patient perinatal loss on nurses tasked with providing nursing care this paper focuses on internal perceptions and external stresses to explore the impact of this traumatic experience on nurses and related coping strategies we found that nurses experience a grieving process similar to those directly suffering from perinatal loss nurses feel sadness incompetence and helplessness but dare not cry in order to protect their professional image they may also worry about the potential legal risks of verbalizing or otherwise expressing their feelings strategies frequently used to adjust to the emotional strain include limiting his or her commitment to the patient seeking emotional escape and talking to colleagues therefore it is important to develop institute or hospital based emotional support networks and training programs and evidence based nursing care standards for this important issue this paper also suggests future policies nursing strategies and further research directions
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	recruitment of orbitofrontal cortex during unpredictable threat among adults at risk for affective disorders mood and anxiety disorders are characterized by altered prefrontal amygdala function and increased behavioral inhibition in response to potential threat whether these alterations constitute a vulnerability or a symptom of illness remains unclear the medial orbitofrontal cortex mofc is thought to play a central role in estimating probability and cost of threat in turn informing selection of subsequent behaviors to better understand the behavioral and neural processes that may be associated with risk for psychopathology we used a virtual reality paradigm to examine behavioral and neural responses of psychiatrically healthy adults with familial history of affective disorders during anticipation of unpredictable threat twenty psychiatrically healthy adults with high familial risk for affective disorders and num low risk matched controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging concurrent with a paradigm in which they explored virtual contexts associated with the threat of shock or safety from shock subjective anxiety ratings skin conductance exploratory behavior and neural responses were examined for threat versus safe conditions high risk adults evidenced greater right mofc activation as well as greater compared to low risk adults there were no significant group differences in subjective ratings or autonomic responses individuals exhibiting greater activity in the right mofc showed greater and decreased skin conductance response these results suggest that and mofc recruitment during anticipation of aversive outcomes may reflect a vulnerability for affective disorders however such a response may also serve as a compensatory response protecting these high risk individuals from negative outcomes i e increased physiological arousal these results suggest that the may play a central role in driving threat related behaviors and thus may be a target for efforts aimed at early detection or prevention
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	exploring the function of selective attention and hypervigilance for threat in anxiety theoretical frameworks of anxiety propose that attentional biases to threat related stimuli cause or maintain anxious states the current paper draws on theoretical frameworks and key empirical studies to outline the distinctive attentional processes highlighted as being important in understanding anxiety we develop a conceptual framework to make a distinction between two attentional biases selective attention to threat and hypervigilance for threat we suggest that these biases each have a different purpose and can account for the typical patterns of facilitated and impaired attention evident in anxious individuals the framework is novel in its specification of the eye movement behavior associated with these attentional biases we highlight that selective attention involves narrowing overt attention onto threat to ensure that these stimuli receive processing priority leading to rapid engagement with task relevant threat and delayed disengagement from task irrelevant threat we show that hypervigilance operates in the presence and absence of threat and involves monitoring for potential dangers via attentional broadening or excessive scanning of the environment with numerous eye movements leading to improved threat detection and increased distraction from task irrelevant threat we conclude that future research could usefully employ eye movement measures to more clearly understand the diverse roles of attention in anxiety
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	dispositional anxiety and frontal midline theta on the modulatory influence of sex and situational threat in their adaptive control hypothesis cavanagh and shackman num recently claimed that dispositional anxiety is correlated with frontal midline theta fmtheta as a generic need for control signal of the anterior midcingulate cortex here we tested this assumption also considering potential modulatory influences of anticipatory threat and individuals sex in a nonclinical sample of num participants num women electroencephalogram was recorded while individuals performed a simple two choice task half of the participants were assigned to a threat anticipation condition anticipation of public speaking whereas the other half was assigned to a control condition state anxiety was monitored across the experiment dispositional anxiety was assessed by self report scales which were completed before individuals came to the laboratory target stimuli in the two choice task induced a transient increase in fmtheta power that was subject to an interaction of dispositional anxiety sex and experimental group only in women who anticipated public speaking did we observe a substantial positive relation between dispositional anxiety and general fmtheta power our results indicate that the link between dispositional anxiety and fmtheta is not universal but rather depends on complex interactions of individuals sex and situational threat
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	anxiety sensitivity and the anticipation of predictable and unpredictable threat evidence from the startle response and event related potentials there is growing evidence that heightened sensitivity to unpredictable threat is a core mechanism of dysfunction in anxiety disorders however it is unclear whether anxiety sensitivity is also associated with sensitivity to unpredictable threat in the present study num participants completed the anxiety sensitivity index num which includes physical concerns social concerns and cognitive concerns subscales and a predictable vs unpredictable threat of shock task startle eyeblink and responses to the acoustic startle probes were measured during the task and were associated with heightened and attenuated respectively startle for the unpredictable but not predictable condition were also associated with attenuated probe for the unpredictable condition only and were associated with increased suppression across the predictable and unpredictable conditions this study provides novel evidence that the different anxiety sensitivity dimensions demonstrate unique relationships with the rdoc domains acute and potential threat
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	trait anxiety modulates supraliminal and subliminal threat brain potential evidence for early and late processing influences analysis of threat is thought to involve a quick and dirty stage in conjunction with slower processing that is more complete we investigated both types of threat analysis by recording brain potentials in response to threat and neutral words personality testing was used to identify participants who were either high or low in trait anxiety an observed enhancement of occipital potentials to threat words during an emotional stroop task was interpreted as a signal of unconscious processing since it was early independent of whether word exposure was subliminal or supraliminal and more prominent the higher the level of later positive potentials were also enhanced for threat versus neutral words but the amplitude enhancement increased with higher only in the subliminal condition these results suggest that unconscious analysis of threat is intensified in those prone to anxiety as is a later stage of threat processing subject to dynamic interactions between automatic and strategic influences
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	maternal anxiety and cognitive biases towards threat in their own and their child s environment cognitive biases are known to play an important role in anxiety in this study we investigate whether maternal anxiety is associated with biases in interpretation attention and catastrophic processing about self referent stimuli that may signal potential threat in the mother s own environment we also investigate whether maternal anxiety is associated with biases about stimuli that their own child may encounter or to child related stimuli more broadly three hundred mothers with a child aged num to num years participated all participants completed a trait anxiety measure and an ambiguous sentences task to assess interpretation bias for self and child referent situations subset of the sample completed a catastrophizing interview about a self n num or child referent n num worry topic and an attentional dot probe task n num with general threat and child threat stimuli maternal anxiety was not significantly associated with an attentional bias for general or child threat stimuli but was significantly associated with a bias for threat interpretations of both self and child referent situations higher maternal anxiety was also significantly associated with generating more catastrophic outcomes to both a self referent and child referent hypothetical worry situation we consider whether maternal cognitive biases which extend to influence how mothers process potential threats in their child s world may be an important mechanism through which intergenerational transmission of anxiety could occur
Sleep_Wakefulness	hypocretin orexina containing axons innervate locus coeruleus neurons that project to the rat medial prefrontal cortex implication in the sleep wakefulness cycle and cortical activation the hypocretin orexina hcrt oxa neuropeptides are found in a group of posterolateral hypothalamus neurons and are involved in sleep wakefulness cycle regulation hcrt oxa neurons project widely to brainstem aminergic structures such as the locus coeruleus which are involved in maintenance of wakefulness and activation through intense projections to the medial prefrontal cortex mpfc moreover defects of the hcrt oxa system are linked to narcolepsy a disorder characterized by excessive diurnal hypersomnia and state disturbance we aimed to determine whether hcrt oxa neurons innervate neurons noradrenergic and nonnoradrenergic that project to the mpfc thereby sustaining behavioral wakefulness to assess this we used retrograde tracing from mpfc injections and either hcrt oxa or tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemical labeling in single sections of rat the retrograde tracer fluorogold was microinjected into mpfc and at optimal survival periods sections through the were processed for dual immunolabeling of anti and either anti hcrt oxa or anti antisera many neurons projecting to mpfc were nonnoradrenergic electron microscopy revealed a prominent localization of hcrt oxa in unmyelinated axons and axon boutons varicosities and axon terminals within the hcrt oxa immunoreactive axon boutons frequently apposed num num or made asymmetric excitatory type synapses num num with immunolabeled dendrites indicating that hcrt oxa can modulate the activity of neurons with cortical projections our results show that hcrt oxa hypothalamic neurons likely excite neurons that project to the mpfc and thus activate and facilitate wakefulness in narcoleptics who are deficient in hcrt oxa impairment of this hcrt oxa hypothalamic input to might contribute to the appearance of excessive daytime sleepiness
Sleep_Wakefulness	sleep wakefulness in alcohol preferring and non preferring rats following binge alcohol administration the alcohol preferring rat is a valid animal model of alcoholism however the effect of alcohol on sleep in or alcohol non preferring rats is unknown since alcohol consumption has tremendous impact on sleep the present study compared the effects of binge alcohol administration on sleep wakefulness in and rats using standard surgical procedures the and rats were bilaterally implanted with sleep recording electrodes following post operative recovery and habituation pre ethanol baseline sleep wakefulness was electrographically recorded for num h subsequently ethanol was administered beginning with a priming dose of num g kg followed by two doses of num g kg every num h on the first day and three doses of num g kg num h on the second day on the following day post ethanol undisturbed sleep wakefulness was electrographically recorded for num h our initial results suggest that during baseline conditions the time spent in each of the three behavioral states wakefulness non rapid eye movement sleep and sleep was comparable between and rats however the rats were more susceptible to changes in sleep wakefulness following num days of binge ethanol treatment as compared to rats the rats displayed insomnia like symptoms including a significant reduction in the amount of time spent in sleep coupled with a significant increase in wakefulness on post ethanol day subsequent analysis revealed that binge ethanol induced increased wakefulness and reduced sleep in rats occurred mainly in the dark period this is the first study that num demonstrates spontaneous sleep wake profile in and rats and num compares the effects of binge ethanol treatment on sleep in and rats our results suggest that as compared to rats the rats were more susceptible to sleep disruptions after binge ethanol treatment in addition the rats exhibited insomnia like symptoms observed during abstinence from alcohol in human subjects
Sleep_Wakefulness	effects of a newly developed potent orexin num receptor selective antagonist compound num m on sleep wakefulness states in mice orexins also known as hypocretins play critical roles in the regulation of sleep wakefulness states by activating two protein coupled receptors gpcrs orexin num and orexin num receptors in order to understand the differential contribution of both receptors in regulating sleep wakefulness states we compared the pharmacological effects of a newly developed antagonist num compound num m m with those of a dual orexin receptor antagonist suvorexant in mice after oral administration in the dark period both cm and suvorexant decreased wakefulness time with similar efficacy in a dose dependent manner while cm primarily increased total non rapid eye movement sleep time without affecting episode durations and with minimal effects on sleep suvorexant increased both total and sleep time and episode durations with predominant effects on sleep fos immunostaining showed that both compounds affected the activities of arousal related neurons with different patterns the number of fos noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus was lower in the suvorexant group as compared with the control and cm treated groups in contrast the numbers of fos neurons in histaminergic neurons in the tuberomamillary nucleus and serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe were reduced to a similar extent in the suvorexant and cm groups as compared with the vehicle treated group together these results suggest that an orexin mediated suppression of sleep via potential activation of oxrs in the locus coeruleus may possibly contribute to the differential effects on sleep wakefulness exerted by a as compared to a num

Sleep_Wakefulness	hybrid approach for continuous detection of sleep wakefulness fluctuations validation in patients with cheyne stokes respiration fluctuations in sleep wake state have been proposed as an important mechanism contributing to the development of oscillatory breathing patterns including cheyne stokes respiration in patients with heart failure in order to properly assess the interactions between changes in state and changes in ventilatory parameters a methodology capable of continuously and reliably detecting state transitions is needed traditional fixed epoch analysis of polysomnographic recordings is not suitable for this purpose moreover visual identification of changes in the dominant electroencephalogram activity at the transition from wakefulness to sleep and vice versa is often very subjective we have therefore developed a hybrid approach including both visual scoring and computer based procedures for continuous analysis of state transitions from polysomnographic recordings specifically tailored for fluctuations between wakefulness and non rapid eye movement num and num sleep the overall analysis process comprises three major phases num manual identification of relevant electroencephalogram electrooculogram features and events including a sample of unequivocal alpha and theta delta activity num automatic statistical discrimination of dominant electroencephalogram activity and num state classification wakefulness non rapid eye movement num and num the latter is carried out by merging information from visual scoring with the output of the discriminator validation has been carried out in num patients with heart failure during daytime cheyne stokes respiration using a training and testing set of electroencephalogram polysomnograms the statistical discriminator correctly classified num num num num and num num num num of unequivocal alpha and theta delta activity this approach has therefore the potential to be used to reliably measure the incidence and location of sleep wake transitions during abnormal breathing patterns as well as their temporal relationship with major ventilatory events
Sleep_Wakefulness	altered electroencephalographic activity associated with changes in the sleep wakefulness cycle of mice in response to a photoperiod shortening under natural conditions diurnal rhythms of biological processes of the organism are synchronized with each other and to the environmental changes by means of the circadian system disturbances of the latter affect hormonal levels sleep wakefulness cycle and cognitive performance to study mechanisms of such perturbations animal models subjected to artificial photoperiods are often used the goal of current study was to understand the effects of circadian rhythm disruption caused by a short light dark cycle regime on activity of the cerebral cortex in rodents we used electroencephalogram to assess the distribution of vigilance states perform spectral analysis and estimate the homeostatic sleep drive in addition we analyzed spontaneous locomotion of mice under symmetric num num and num h long light dark cycles using video recording and tracking methods we found that shortening of photoperiod caused a significant increase of slow wave activity during non rapid eye movement sleep suggesting an elevation of sleep pressure under such conditions while the rhythm of spontaneous locomotion was completely entrained by all light dark cycles tested periodic changes in the power of the theta and gamma frequency ranges during wakefulness gradually disappeared under num and num h long light dark cycles this was associated with a significant increase in the theta gamma phase amplitude coupling during wakefulness our results thus provide deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the impairment of learning and memory retention which is associated with disturbed circadian regulation
Sleep_Wakefulness	balanced sleep wakefulness classification method based on actigraphic data in adolescents several research groups have developed automated sleep wakefulness classifiers for night wrist actigraphic data these classifiers tend to be unbalanced with a tendency to overestimate the detection of sleep at the expense of poorer detection of wakefulness the reason for this is that the measure of success in previous works was the maximization of the overall accuracy disregarding the balance between sensitivity and specificity the databases were usually sleep recordings hence the over representation of sleep samples in this work an artificial neural network sleep wakefulness classifier is presented data was collected every minute an num min moving window was used as observing frame for data analysis as applied in previous sleep studies however our feature set adds new variables such as the time of the day the median and the median absolute deviation sleep and wakefulness data were balanced to improve the system training comparison with previous studies can still be done by choosing the point in the curve associated with the corresponding data balance our results are compared with a polysomnogram based hypnogram as golden standard rendering an accuracy of num num a sensitivity of num num and a specificity of num num geometric mean between sensitivity and specificity is num num

Sustained_Threat	the error related negativity transdiagnostic marker of sustained threat the creation of the national institute of mental health research domain criteria rdoc project has been the driving force behind the reconceptualization of the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders in this commentary explore whether the error related negativity can be considered as a transdiagnostic marker of sustained threat based on findings from weinberg meyer et al s num study in relation to current findings in the literature potential alternative study designs use of a multimodal approach to the assessment of a specific phenotype of clinical phenomenon and the importance of integrating a neurodevelopmental perspective are also discussed
Sustained_Threat	human bed nucleus of the stria terminalis indexes hypervigilant threat monitoring though a key symptom underlying many anxiety disorders is hypervigilant threat monitoring its biological bases in humans remain poorly understood animal models suggest that anxious processes such as hypervigilant threat monitoring are distinct from cued fear like responses and mediated by the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis here we applied psychophysiological and neuroimaging methodologies sensitive to sustained arousal based responses to test the role of the human in mediating environmental threat monitoring a potential experimental model for sustained anxiety symptoms healthy participants n num with varying trait anxiety performed an environmental threat monitoring task during functional magnetic resonance imaging where a stimulus line continuously fluctuated in height providing information relevant to subsequent risk for electric shocks skin conductance was collected in a separate cohort n num to validate task evoked modulation of physiological arousal forebrain region consistent with the showed greater overall recruitment and exaggerated tracking of threat proximity in individuals with greater anxiety the insular cortex tracked threat proximity across all participants showed exaggerated threat proximity responding with greater anxiety and showed enhanced recruitment when threat proximity was ostensibly controllable activity in the and insula continuously monitored changes in environmental threat level and also subserved hypervigilant threat monitoring processes in more highly trait anxious individuals these findings bridge human and animal research informing the role of the in anxious related processes in addition these findings suggest that continuous functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigms offer promise in further elucidating the neural circuitries supporting sustained anticipatory features of anxiety
Sustained_Threat	spider or no spider neural correlates of sustained and phasic fear in spider phobia processes of phasic fear responses to threatening stimuli are thought to be distinct from sustained anticipatory anxiety toward an unpredicted potential threat there is evidence for dissociable neural correlates of phasic fear and sustained anxiety whereas increased amygdala activity has been associated with phasic fear sustained anxiety has been linked with activation of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis anterior cingulate cortex and the insula so far only a few studies have focused on the dissociation of neural processes related to both phasic and sustained fear in specific phobia we suggested that first conditions of phasic and sustained fear would involve different neural networks and second that overall neural activity would be enhanced in a sample of phobic compared to nonphobic participants pictures of spiders and neutral stimuli under conditions of either predicted phasic or unpredicted sustained fear were presented to num subjects with spider phobia and num nonphobic control subjects during functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri scanning phobic patients revealed significantly higher amygdala activation than controls under conditions of phasic fear sustained fear processing was significantly related to activation in the insula and and phobic patients showed a stronger activation than controls of the and the right under conditions of sustained fear functional connectivity analysis revealed enhanced connectivity of the and the amygdala in phobic subjects our findings support the idea of distinct neural correlates of phasic and sustained fear processes increased neural activity and functional connectivity in these networks might be crucial for the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders
Sustained_Threat	initial and sustained brain responses to contextual conditioned anxiety in humans contextual fear conditioning takes place if the occurrence of threat cannot be predicted by specific cues as a consequence the context becomes the best predictor of the threat and later induces anxiety sustained fear response previous studies suggest that both the amygdala and the hippocampus are crucial for contextual fear conditioning first we wanted to further elucidate the neuronal correlates of long lasting contextual threat within a highly ecologically setting created in virtual reality second we wanted to distinguish between initial and sustained components of the anxiety response to a threatening situation twenty four participants were guided through two virtual offices for s each they received unpredictable electric stimuli unconditioned stimulus in one office anxiety context but never in the second office safety context successful contextual fear conditioning was indexed by higher anxiety and enhanced expectancy ratings for versus initial neural activity was assessed by modeling the onsets of both contexts and sustained neural activity by considering the entire context duration contrasts amygdala and hippocampus revealed sustained activity initial and sustained activities were found in the middle temporal gyrus and primary motor cortex additional initial activity was obvious in orbitofrontal dorsomedial dmpfc and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dlpfc these results suggest that entering a threatening context initially induces conditioned fear reactions recall of contingency awareness dlpfc and explicit threat appraisal dmpfc while remaining in the threatening context might involve anxiety like conditioned responses amygdala and the generation of a spatial map to predict where and when a threatening event may occur hippocampus we conclude that in humans initial versus sustained anxiety responses triggered by a threat associated context are associated with distinguishable brain activation patterns involving a fear network and a contingency cognitive network respectively
