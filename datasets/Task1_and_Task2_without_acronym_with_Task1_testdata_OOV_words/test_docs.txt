Acute_Threat_Fear	acute cancer cognitive therapy the utility of cognitive therapy for ambulatory cancer patients is clear but the acute cancer setting significantly shapes the therapeutic interaction parameters and delivery of in this article we describe how to apply to acute cancer settings focusing on how this approach differs from traditionally taught ambulatory we highlight the importance of a tailored history and formulation how the cognitive model is applied within an acute cancer context to promote coping and adaptation reframing must consider the grain of truth to many so called distorted cognitions such as cancer means death fear of recurrence is an example of a common reframing challenge another is the tyranny of positive thinking here there is avoidance of considering negative outcomes such as death patients are told to think positive leaving them alone at a time of life threatening crisis instead acute cancer utilizes a stance of realistic optimism empathy plays a vital role in turning off the bracing reaction to threat and facilitating problem solving successfully combining with medications is integral to this model we also discuss how can be applied to discussing prognosis the desire for hastened death and suicidality as well as death and dying in general because of the ubiquitous nature of cancer most cognitive therapists will encounter patients with cancer in their practices acute cancer is a skill set that should be widely taught to cognitive therapists and flagged as a priority for academic programs and professional organizations
Acute_Threat_Fear	threat response system parallel brain processes in pain vis a vis fear and anxiety pain is essential for avoidance of tissue damage and for promotion of healing notwithstanding the survival value pain brings about emotional suffering reflected in fear and anxiety which in turn augment pain thus giving rise to a self sustaining feedforward loop given such reciprocal relationships the present article uses neuroscientific conceptualizations of fear and anxiety as a theoretical framework for hitherto insufficiently understood pathophysiological mechanisms underlying chronic pain to that end searches of pubmed indexed journals were performed using the following medical subject headings terms pain and nociception plus amygdala anxiety cognitive fear sensory and unconscious recursive sets of scientific and clinical evidence extracted from this literature review were summarized within the following key areas num parallelism between acute pain and fear and between chronic pain and anxiety num all are related to the evasion of sensory perceived threats and are subserved by subcortical circuits mediating automatic threat induced physiologic responses and defensive actions in conjunction with higher order corticolimbic networks e g thalamocortical thalamo striato cortical and amygdalo cortical generating conscious representations and valuation based adaptive behaviors num some instances of chronic pain and anxiety conditions are driven by the failure to diminish or block respective nociceptive information or unconscious treats from reaching conscious awareness and num the neural correlates of pain related conscious states and cognitions may become autonomous i e dissociated from the subcortical activity function leading to the eventual chronicity identifying relative contributions of the diverse neuroanatomical sources thus offers prospects for the development of novel preventive diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in chronic pain patients
Acute_Threat_Fear	motivation as a crucial predictor of good compliance in adolescents with rheumatoid arthritis the purpose of this study was to identify the predictors of compliance shown by adolescents with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis three hundred individuals aged num num years were randomly selected from the finnish social insurance institution s register the questionnaires were sent to the adolescents selected from the register to be returned directly to the researcher in a self addressed envelope ninety one per cent n num returned the questionnaire logistic regression was used to find the factors that predicted compliance with health regimens the compliance of adolescents with was predicted on the basis of motivation fear of acute problems support from nurses energy and willpower and threat to social well being the most powerful predictor was motivation the likelihood of the adolescents who had good motivation to comply with health regimens was num num fold compared to the adolescents who did not have good motivation the next powerful predictor was fear of acute problems the adolescents who felt fear of acute problems complied with health regimens with a num num fold likelihood compared to the adolescents who did not have fears the third powerful predictor was support from nurses the likelihood of adolescents supported by nurse to comply with health regimens was num num fold compared to the adolescents who did not receive support from nurses the likelihood of adolescents who had energy and willpower to comply with health regimens was num num fold compared to the adolescents who did not have energy and willpower also the threat to social well being predicted good compliance

Acute_Threat_Fear	how acute stress may enhance subsequent memory for threat stimuli outside the focus of attention amygdala decoupling stress related disorders e g anxiety and depression are characterized by decreased top down control for distracting information as well as a memory bias for threatening information however it is unclear how acute stress biases mnemonic encoding and leads to prioritized storage of threat related information even if outside the focus of attention in the current study healthy adults num all male were randomly assigned to stress induction using the socially evaluated cold pressor test or a control condition participants performed a task in which they were required to identify a target letter within a string of letters that were either identical to the target and thereby facilitating detection low distractor load or mixed with other letters to complicate the search high load either a fearful or neutral face was presented on the background outside the focus of attention twenty four hours later participants were asked to perform a surprise recognition memory test for those background faces stress induction resulted in increased cortisol and negative subjective mood ratings stress did not affect visual search performance however participants in the stress group showed stronger memory compared to the control group for fearful faces in the low attentional load condition critically the stress induced memory bias was accompanied by decoupling between amygdala and during encoding which may represent a mechanism for decreased ability to filter task irrelevant threatening background information the current study provides a potential neural account for how stress can produce a negative memory bias for threatening information even if presented outside the focus of attention despite of an adaptive advantage for survival such tendencies may ultimately also lead to generalized fear a possibility requiring additional investigation
Acute_Threat_Fear	pain catastrophizing threat and the informational value of mood task persistence during a painful finger pressing task pain catastrophizing has shown to predict avoidance behavior in acute and chronic pain but the literature is inconsistent the present study tested the hypothesis that current mood and threat context moderate the relationship between pain catastrophizing and performance duration affective motivational models postulate that negative and positive moods provide information about whether an activity is respectively threatening or safe moreover it has been proposed that stable cognitive schemas about threat influence behavior particularly in threat relevant contexts the present study aimed to establish whether pain catastrophizing is related to less or greater performance duration when participants experience respectively negative or positive moods particularly in a high threatening pain context num mood x num threat context between subjects factorial design was applied in num healthy participants with pain catastrophizing as covariate and performance duration during a painful finger pressing task as dependent variables as predicted higher pain catastrophizing was associated with less performance duration when participants experienced negative moods the opposite was found when participants experienced positive moods moreover these relationships were most pronounced in a high threatening pain context this study suggests that the relationship between pain catastrophizing and performance duration during painful activities is moderated by situational factors such as current mood and threat context
Acute_Threat_Fear	threat and fear of pain induces attentional bias to pain words an eye tracking study this study aimed to investigate the effects of fear of pain and threat on attentional biases using eye tracking methods one hundred and seven undergraduate students were randomized to receive threatening or reassuring information about the cold pressor task and divided into high and low groups participants completed the dot probe task while their eye movements were tracked results showed that those who received threatening information were less likely to have their first fixation on pain words particularly affective pain words furthermore under conditions of high threat the high group who did fixate on affective pain words fixated more quickly than for sensory pain words whereas the opposite was the case under low threat in regression analyses initial vigilance towards affective pain words was a significant predictor of reporting pain more quickly on the cold pressor taken together these results suggest that initial vigilance of affective pain stimuli predicts actual hypervigilance to an acute experimental pain task however under conditions of high threat participants show evidence of avoidance of affective pain words even though when they do fixate on these stimuli the high group does so more quickly these results confirm that attentional processes characterized by vigilance avoidance appear important interventions that change attention towards pain to reduce vigilance and subsequent avoidance may be indicated to improve pain outcomes
Acute_Threat_Fear	the role of perceived threat in the emergence of and depression symptoms during warzone deployment numerous studies have shown that level of exposure to combat related stressors is a robust risk factor for posttraumatic stress disorder and depression among military personnel deployed to a warzone threat perception of warzone experiences assessed retrospectively has been consistently linked to increased risk for and depression months or even years after returning from deployment however little is known about concurrent relations between perceived threat deployment stress and stress related symptoms during deployment using a novel in theater web based assessment system we investigated the unique and joint contribution of threat perception and deployment stressors in predicting the emergence of and depression symptoms during deployment soldiers num completed assessments of deployment stressors perceived threat symptoms and depression symptoms throughout deployment to iraq results revealed that perceived threat potentiated the increase in symptoms as a result of increases in deployment stressors in contrast perceived threat but not warzone stressors uniquely predicted depression symptoms results highlight the important role of threat perception as a risk marker for the acute experience of depression and symptoms during deployment psycinfo database record
Acute_Threat_Fear	comparison of the effect of mindfulness and relaxation on responses to acute experimental pain this study aimed to investigate the efficacy of mindfulness training in comparison with relaxation training on pain threshold and tolerance during the cold pressor task undergraduate psychology students n num were randomly assigned to receive reassuring or threatening information about the cold pressor participants were then re randomized to receive mindfulness or a control intervention relaxation training analyses confirmed that the threat manipulation was effective in increasing worry fear of harm and expectations of pain and reducing coping efficacy interaction effects revealed that mindfulness was effective in increasing curiosity and reducing decentring under conditions of high threat but not low threat other interactions on cognitive variables attentional bias to pain and self focus confirmed that mindfulness and relaxation appeared to exert influences under different conditions i e mindfulness high threat and relaxation low threat despite these cognitive effects being discerned under different conditions there were no differences between mindfulness and relaxation on pain tolerance or threshold in either threat group these results show that a single brief session of mindfulness based on body scanning is not sufficient to change the way in which individuals approach an experimental pain task in comparison with relaxation which has previously been shown to be ineffective
Acute_Threat_Fear	trait mindfulness modulates neuroendocrine and affective responses to social evaluative threat individual differences in mindfulness have been associated with numerous self report indicators of stress but research has not examined how mindfulness may buffer neuroendocrine and psychological stress responses under controlled laboratory conditions the present study investigated the role of trait mindfulness in buffering cortisol and affective responses to a social evaluative stress challenge versus a control task participants completed measures of trait mindfulness perceived stress anxiety and fear of negative evaluation before being randomized to complete the trier social stress test kirschbaum et al num or a control task at points throughout the session participants provided five saliva samples to assess cortisol response patterns and completed four self report measures of anxiety and negative affect to assess psychological responses in accord with hypotheses higher trait mindfulness predicted lower cortisol responses to the relative to the control task as well as lower anxiety and negative affect these relations remained significant when controlling for the role of other variables that predicted cortisol and affective responses the findings suggest that trait mindfulness modulates cortisol and affective responses to an acute social stressor further research is needed to understand the neural pathways through which mindfulness impacts these responses
Acute_Threat_Fear	depression history as a moderator of relations between cortisol and shame responses to social evaluative threat in young adults changes in cortisol and shame are commonly elicited by psychosocial stressors involving social evaluative threat according to social self preservation theory this coordinated psychobiological response is adaptive individuals with a history of depression however may exhibit diminished cortisol reactivity to acute stressors which could interfere with coordinated cortisol and shame responses the present study examined temporal relations between cortisol and shame responses to a psychosocial stress task in young adults who varied in their history of depression num remitted depressed num never depressed lagged effects multilevel models revealed that depression history moderated relations between cortisol levels and shame ratings num min later the pattern of these interactions was similar whereas higher cortisol levels predicted increases in shame in never depressed individuals cortisol levels were unrelated to shame responses in remitted depressed individuals findings suggest a dissociation between cortisol and shame responses to stress in individuals with a history of depression
Acute_Threat_Fear	freeze flight fight fright faint adaptationist perspectives on the acute stress response spectrum this article reviews the existing evolutionary perspectives on the acute stress response habitual faintness and blood injection injury type specific phobia phobia in this article an alternative evolutionary perspective based on recent advances in evolutionary psychology is proposed specifically that fear induced faintness eg fainting following the sight of a syringe blood or following a trivial skin injury is a distinct homo sapiens specific extreme stress survival response to an inescapable threat the article suggests that faintness evolved in response to middle paleolithic intra group and inter group violence of con specifics rather than as a pan mammalian defense response as is presently assumed based on recent literature freeze flight fight fright faint provides a more complete description of the human acute stress response sequence than current descriptions faintness one of three primary physiological reactions involved in phobia is extremely rare in other phobias since heritability estimates are higher for faintness than for fears or phobias the author suggests that trait faintness may be a useful complement to trait anxiety as an endophenotype in research on the human fear circuitry some implications for the forthcoming diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders fifth edition as well as for clinical health services and transcriptomic research are briefly discussed
Acute_Threat_Fear	human brain evolution and the neuroevolutionary time depth principle implications for the reclassification of fear circuitry related traits in and for studying resilience to warzone related posttraumatic stress disorder the and num have judiciously minimized discussion of etiologies to distance clinical psychiatry from freudian psychoanalysis with this goal mostly achieved discussion of etiological factors should be reintroduced into the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders fifth edition research agenda for the advocated the development of a pathophysiologically based classification system the author critically reviews the neuroevolutionary literature on stress induced and fear circuitry disorders and related amygdala driven species atypical fear behaviors of clinical severity in adult humans over num empirically testable falsifiable predictions are presented it is noted that in and num the classification of stress and fear circuitry disorders is neither mode of acquisition based nor brain evolution based for example snake phobia innate and dog phobia overconsolidational are clustered together similarly research on blood

fear of the sight of one s blood or a sharp object penetrating one s skin genetic architecture charting of fear circuitry related traits has been challenging various non phenotype based architectures can serve as targets for research in this article the author will propose one such alternative genetic architecture this article was inspired by the following nesse s smoke detector principle the increasing suspicion that the smooth rather than lumpy distribution of complex psychiatric phenotypes including fear circuitry disorders may in some cases be accounted for by oligogenic and not necessarily polygenic transmission and insights from the initial sequence of the chimpanzee genome and comparison with the human genome by the chimpanzee sequencing and analysis consortium published in late num neuroevolutionary insights relevant to fear circuitry symptoms that primarily emerge overconsolidationally especially combat related posttraumatic stress disorder are presented also introduced is a human evolution based principle for clustering innate fear traits the neuroevolutionary time depth principle of innate fears proposed in this article may be useful in the development of a neuroevolution based taxonomic re clustering of stress triggered and fear circuitry disorders in four broad clusters of evolved fear circuits are proposed based on their time depths num mesozoic mammalian wide circuits hardwired by wild type alleles driven to fixation by mesozoic selective sweeps num cenozoic simian wide circuits relevant to many specific phobias num mid paleolithic and upper paleolithic homo sapiens specific circuits arguably resulting mostly from mate choice driven stabilizing selection num neolithic circuits arguably mostly related to stabilizing selection driven by gene culture co evolution more importantly the author presents evolutionary perspectives on warzone related combat stress reaction combat related stress operational stress and other deployment stress

bioevents amygdala driven and locus coeruleus driven epidemic pseudosomatic symptoms may be an order of magnitude more common than infection caused cytokine driven symptoms implications for the red cross and are discussed it is also argued that hospital phobia as well as dog phobia bird phobia and bat phobia require re taxonomization in in a new overconsolidational disorders category anchored around the overconsolidational spectrum category may be conceptualized as straddling the fear circuitry spectrum disorders and the affective spectrum disorders categories and may be a category for

Acute_Threat_Fear	the genetic and environmental structure of fear and anxiety in juvenile twins fear and anxiety are conceptualized as responses to acute or potential threat respectively adult twin studies found substantial interplay between genetic and environmental factors influencing fear disorders phobias and anxiety disorders research in children however has largely examined these factors independently thus there exists a substantial knowledge gap regarding the underlying etiologic structure of these closely related constructs during development symptom counts for five fear criticism the unknown death animal medical and four anxiety generalized panic separation social dimensions were obtained for num twin pairs ages num num multivariate twin modeling was performed to elucidate the genetic and environmental influences distributed amongst these dimensions the best fitting model contained one genetic two familial environmental and two unique environmental factors shared between fear and anxiety symptoms plus dimension specific genetic and unique environmental factors although several environmental factors were shared between fear and anxiety dimensions one latent factor accounted for genetic influences across both domains while adult studies find somewhat distinct etiological differences between anxiety and phobic disorders the current results suggest that their relative genetic and environmental influences are not as clearly demarcated in children these etiological distinctions are more nuanced likely contributing to the highly diffuse symptom patterns seen during development

Acute_Threat_Fear	the effect of attentional re training and threat expectancy in response to acute pain this study aimed to investigate the efficacy of implicit attention re training on pain ratings threshold and tolerance during the cold pressor task and to determine whether the effectiveness of was affected by threat expectancy one hundred and four undergraduate psychology students were randomly assigned to receive either threat alleviating or threat inducing information about the task participants were then re randomized to receive an that either trained them to implicitly attend to neutral and ignore pain related stimuli neutral training or to attend towards pain related stimuli pain training hence the present study had a num threat expectancy high vs low x num pain vs neutral design manipulation checks confirmed that the threat manipulation was effective in increasing threat expectancy and the training paradigm shifted attentional biases in predicted directions results showed that relative to neutral re training those in the pain re training group reported higher levels of pain s into the cold pressor task and registered pain more quickly there was no difference in tolerance between the groups nor pain at tolerance this was the same pattern of results found for the threat induction for initial pain ratings there was an interaction that closely approached significance p num num these results show that affects individual s perceptions of and their responses to pain during an experimental task in a similar way to increasing the threat expectancy of the task future research should trial in real life settings to determine whether these results can be generalized
Acute_Threat_Fear	acute administration of nicotine into the higher order auditory te cortex specifically decreases the fear related charge of remote emotional memories nicotine elicits several behavioural effects on mood as well as on stress and anxiety processes recently it was found that the higher order components of the sensory cortex such as the secondary auditory cortex te are essential for the long term storage of remote fear memories therefore in the present study we examined the effects of acute nicotine injection into the higher order auditory cortex te on the remote emotional memories of either threat or incentive experiences in rats we found that intra te nicotine injection decreased the fear evoked responses to a tone previously paired with footshock this effect was cue and dose specific and was not due to any interference with auditory stimuli processing innate anxiety and fear processes or with motor responses nicotine acts acutely in the presence of threat stimuli but it did not determine the permanent degradation of the fear memory trace since memories tested one week after nicotine injection were unaffected remarkably nicotine did not affect the memory of a similar tone that was paired to incentive stimuli we conclude from our results that nicotine when acting acutely in the auditory cortex relieves the fear charge embedded by learned stimuli
Acute_Threat_Fear	the coping process in adults with acute leukemia undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation the increasing numbers of leukemia cancer survivors treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation face numerous challenges after their transplant procedure little information has been published regarding the coping process of this population understanding how they cope with this life threatening disease can assist healthcare professionals to provide holistic care this study was designed to elicit the coping process of adults experiencing acute leukemia who underwent therapy this longitudinal qualitative study and grounded theory took place during num num ten adults with acute leukemia scheduled for were recruited from shariati hospital in tehran iran series of pretransplant and posttransplant interviews were held in the hospital s units final interviews took place num num months posttransplant in the hospital s outpatient clinic the five categories that emerged from the data included perceived threat suspension between fear and hope rebirth contextual factors and coping strategies although patients vacillated within the coping spectrum i e the buffer zone between fighting and acquiescing finding meaning was identified as the final outcome of their experience that indicated effective coping each patient perceives leukemia and therapy uniquely this life threatening disease can significantly affect patient perception and change patient lives both temporarily and permanently nurses can apply effective interventions to help patients cope with their unique situation find meaning and hope and allay fear and stress
Acute_Threat_Fear	attentional biases toward sensory pain words in acute and chronic pain patients attentional biases towards pain related words of chronic and acute low back pain patients were compared with healthy pain free controls specifically the aims were to determine num whether chronic patients demonstrate attentional biases compared to pain free controls num whether observed biases are also present in those with acute and num whether observed biases are associated with pain related fear among the pain groups four groups were recruited num acute patients num chronic patients from physiotherapy practices num chronic patients from a tertiary referral pain management center and num healthy pain free controls participants were assessed on the dot probe computer task for attentional bias to pain related words all num pain groups demonstrated biases compared to controls on sensory but not on affective disability or threat words among the pain groups those with low and moderate levels of fear of re injury demonstrated biases towards sensory pain words that were absent in those with high levels of fear which is counterintuitive to what the fear of re injury model suggests these results suggest that the experience of pain rather than duration is the primary indicator of the presence of pain related biases attentional biases are present in chronic and acute pain biases towards sensory pain stimuli were demonstrated regardless of pain duration however they were present in those with low and moderate levels of fear of re injury only and not those high in fear these findings are not consistent with the fear of re injury model
Acute_Threat_Fear	frontal cortex stimulation reduces vigilance to threat implications for the treatment of depression and anxiety the difficulty in treating mood disorders has brought about clinical interest in alternative treatments such as transcranial direct current stimulation tdcs of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex however the optimal parameters for stimulation and underlying mechanisms of action are unclear psychiatric treatments have acute effects on emotional processing that predict later therapeutic action such effects have been proposed as cognitive biomarkers for screening novel treatments for depression and anxiety this study assessed the effect of tdcs on a battery of emotional processing measures sensitive to antidepressant action to refine optimal stimulation parameters stimulation using two common electrode montages was compared with sham sixty healthy volunteers received num minutes of active or sham stimulation before completing computerized emotional processing tasks including a dot probe measure of vigilance to threat relative to sham stimulation participants receiving simultaneous anodal stimulation of left and cathodal stimulation of right bipolar balanced montage showed reduced vigilance to threatening stimuli there was no such significant effect when the cathode was placed on the supraorbital ridge bipolar unbalanced montage there were no effects of tdcs on other measures of emotional processing our findings provide the first experimental evidence that modulating activity in the reduces vigilance to threatening stimuli this significant reduction in fear vigilance is similar to that seen with anxiolytic treatments in the same cognitive paradigm the finding that tdcs acutely alters the processing of threatening information suggests a potential cognitive mechanism that could underwrite treatment effects in clinical populations
Acute_Threat_Fear	the effect of cognitive bias modification for interpretation on avoidance of pain during an acute experimental pain task research confirms that patients with chronic pain show a tendency to interpret ambiguous stimuli as pain related however whether modifying these interpretive pain biases impacts pain outcomes is unknown this study aimed to demonstrate that interpretation biases towards pain can be modified and that changing these biases influences pain outcomes in the cold pressor task one hundred and six undergraduate students were randomly allocated to receive either threatening or reassuring information regarding the cold pressor they also were randomly allocated to num of num conditions in the ambiguous scenarios task in which they were trained to have either a threatening interpretation of pain pain bias condition or a nonthreatening interpretation of pain no pain bias condition therefore the study had a num threat reassuring x pain bias no pain bias design analyses showed that a bias was induced contingent on condition and that the threat manipulation was effective participants in the pain bias condition hesitated more before doing the cold pressor task than those in the no pain bias condition as did those in the threat compared with the reassurance condition the major finding was that interpretive bias mediated the relationship between bias condition and hesitance time supporting the causal role of interpretive biases for avoidance behaviors in current chronic pain models no differences were found on other pain outcomes regarding bias or threat and the efficacy of the bias modification was not impacted by different levels of threat these results suggest that cognitive bias modification should be further explored as a potential intervention in pain
Acute_Threat_Fear	interpretation bias in the face of pain a discriminatory fear conditioning approach background and aims interpreting pain and illness related stimuli as health threatening is common among chronic pain patients but also occurs in the general population as interpretation bias may affect pain perception and might even play part in the development and maintenance of chronic pain it is important to improve our understanding of this concept several studies suggest an association between and pain related anxiety however those studies often rely on verbal and pictorial tasks that do not entail a threat of actual pain therefore lacking personal relevance for healthy participants the current study investigated whether healthy individuals show an towards ambiguous health related stimuli in a context of actual pain threat and explored whether this bias is associated to pain anxiety constructs methods thirty six healthy participants were conditioned to expect painful electrocutaneous shocks unconditioned stimulus after health threat words but not after neutral non health threat words in order to establish fear of pain subsequently they completed a verbal interpretation task that contained new and stimuli as well as ambiguous non reinforced health threat and non health threat words was assessed through shock expectancy ratings and startle responses to ambiguous and evident health threatening or neutral word stimuli pain related anxiety was measured with validated questionnaires results the results show a general towards ambiguous health related words on pain expectancies but not on startle response an exploratory analysis suggests that this effect exists irrespective of pain related anxiety levels which however may be due to a lack of power conclusion we present a novel experimental paradigm employing actual health threat that captures towards health related stimuli in healthy individuals taken together results provide evidence for the further consideration of as a latent vulnerability factor in the onset and maintenance of pain chronicity in contrast to previous studies employing a safe pain free context we found that healthy participants show an towards ambiguous health related stimuli when confronted with pain threat implications like chronic pain patients healthy individuals display an towards health threat stimuli when these stimuli become personally relevant by carrying information about pending health threat therefore the presented paradigm could be valuable for pain related cognitive bias research in healthy participants as it may have a higher ecological validity than previous study designs future studies will have to elucidate the influence of anxiety constructs on in larger samples

Acute_Threat_Fear	perceptual processing advantages for trauma related visual cues in post traumatic stress disorder intrusive re experiencing in post traumatic stress disorder comprises distressing sensory impressions from the trauma that seem to occur out of the blue key question is how intrusions are triggered one possibility is that is characterized by a processing advantage for stimuli that resemble those that accompanied the trauma which would lead to increased detection of such cues in the environment we used a blurred picture identification task in a cross sectional n num and a prospective study n num of trauma survivors participants with acute stress disorder or but not trauma survivors without these disorders identified trauma related pictures but not general threat pictures better than neutral pictures there were no group differences in the rate of trauma related answers to other picture categories the relative processing advantage for trauma related pictures correlated with re experiencing and dissociation and predicted at follow up perceptual processing bias for trauma related stimuli may contribute to the involuntary triggering of intrusive trauma memories in
Acute_Threat_Fear	defensive aggregation huddling in rattus norvegicus toward predator odor individual differences social buffering effects and neural correlates aggregation is a defensive strategy employed by many prey species in response to predatory threat our group has characterized defensive aggregation huddling in rattus norvegicus in response to a ball of cat fur in this situation some rats huddle less and approach the threatening cue more than others active vs passive responders the present study explored whether active responding is a stable phenotype associated with behaviors outside direct predatory encounters the neural substrates of active and passive responding under predatory threat were explored using c fos immunohistochemistry finally we examined whether the presence of conspecifics during predatory threat biases behavior towards active responding active and passive responding styles were found to be stable in individual rats across consecutive group exposures to cat fur and were predicted by anxiety like behavior in an open field emergence test active responders displayed less conditioned fear in an environment associated with predatory threat and had higher post exposure intake of a weak sucrose solution a test of anhedonia active responding was associated with greater cat fur induced activation of the accessory olfactory bulb reflecting greater olfactory stimulation in rats actively approaching the fur lowered activation of somatosensory cortex reflecting reduced huddling with conspecifics and reduced activation in the lateral septum social exposure to cat fur promoted active responding relative to individual exposure and lowered c fos expression in the dorsomedial periaqueductal grey medial caudate putamen and lateral habenula we conclude that individual differences in anti predator behavior appear stable traits with active responders having a more resilient phenotype social exposure to predatory threat has an acute buffering effect subtly changing the neural and behavioral response towards threat and encouraging active responding an association between active responding and lower c fos expression in the lateral septum is consistent with previous studies that highlight this region as an important neurobiological substrate of defensive aggregation
Acute_Threat_Fear	generalization of pain related fear based on conceptual knowledge increasing evidence suggests that pain related fear is key to the transition from acute to chronic pain previous research has shown that perceptual similarity with a pain associated movement fosters the generalization of fear to novel movements perceptual generalization of pain related fear is adaptive as it enables individuals to extrapolate the threat value of one movement to another without the necessity to learn anew however excessive spreading of fear to safe movements may become maladaptive and may lead to sustained anxiety dysfunctional avoidance behaviors and severe disability hallmark of human cognition is the ability to extract conceptual knowledge from a learning episode as well although this conceptual pathway may be important to understand fear generalization in chronic pain research on this topic is lacking we investigated acquisition and generalization of concept based pain related fear during acquisition unique exemplars of one action category e g opening boxes were followed by pain whereas exemplars of another action category e g closing boxes were not subsequently spreading of pain related fear to novel exemplars of both action categories was tested participants learned to expect the pain to occur and reported more pain related fear to the exemplars of the category compared with those of the category during generalization fear and expectancy generalized to novel exemplars of the category but not to the category this pattern was not corroborated in the eyeblink startle measures this is the first study that demonstrates that pain related fear can be acquired and generalized based on conceptual knowledge
Acute_Threat_Fear	the influence of acute stress on the regulation of conditioned fear fear learning and regulation is a prominent model for describing the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders and stress related psychopathology fear expression can be modulated using a number of regulatory strategies including extinction cognitive emotion regulation avoidance strategies and reconsolidation in this review we examine research investigating the effects of acute stress and stress hormones on these regulatory techniques we focus on what is known about the impact of stress on the ability to flexibly regulate fear responses that are acquired through pavlovian fear conditioning our primary aim is to explore the impact of stress on fear regulation in humans given this we focus on techniques where stress has been linked to alterations of fear regulation in humans extinction and emotion regulation and briefly discuss other techniques avoidance and reconsolidation where the impact of stress or stress hormones have been mainly explored in animal models these investigations reveal that acute stress may impair the persistent inhibition of fear presumably by altering prefrontal cortex function characterizing the effects of stress on fear regulation is critical for understanding the boundaries within which existing regulation strategies are viable in everyday life and can better inform treatment options for those who suffer from anxiety and stress related psychopathology

Acute_Threat_Fear	the unpredictive brain under threat neurocomputational account of anxious hypervigilance anxious hypervigilance is marked by sensitized sensory perceptual processes and attentional biases to potential danger cues in the environment how this is realized at the neurocomputational level is unknown but could clarify the brain mechanisms disrupted in psychiatric conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder predictive coding instantiated by dynamic causal models provides a promising framework to ground these state related changes in the dynamic interactions of reciprocally connected brain areas anxiety states were elicited in healthy participants n num by exposure to the threat of unpredictable aversive shocks while undergoing magnetoencephalography an auditory oddball sequence was presented to measure cortical responses related to deviance detection and dynamic causal models quantified deviance related changes in effective connectivity participants were also administered alprazolam double blinded placebo controlled crossover to determine whether the cortical effects of threat induced anxiety are reversed by acute anxiolytic treatment deviant tones elicited increased auditory cortical responses under threat bayesian analyses revealed that hypervigilant responding was best explained by increased postsynaptic gain in primary auditory cortex activity as well as modulation of feedforward but not feedback coupling within a temporofrontal cortical network increasing inhibitory gamma aminobutyric acidergic action with alprazolam reduced anxiety and restored feedback modulation within the network threat induced anxiety produced unbalanced feedforward signaling in response to deviations in predicable sensory input amplifying ascending sensory prediction error signals may optimize stimulus detection in the face of impending threats at the same time diminished descending sensory prediction signals impede perceptual learning and may therefore underpin some of the deleterious effects of anxiety on higher order cognition
Acute_Threat_Fear	the neural circuits of innate fear detection integration action and memorization how fear is represented in the brain has generated a lot of research attention not only because fear increases the chances for survival when appropriately expressed but also because it can lead to anxiety and stress related disorders when inadequately processed in this review we summarize recent progress in the understanding of the neural circuits processing innate fear in rodents we propose that these circuits are contained within three main functional units in the brain a detection unit responsible for gathering sensory information signaling the presence of a threat an integration unit responsible for incorporating the various sensory information and recruiting downstream effectors and an output unit in charge of initiating appropriate bodily and behavioral responses to the threatful stimulus in parallel the experience of innate fear also instructs a learning process leading to the memorization of the fearful event interestingly while the detection integration and output units processing acute fear responses to different threats tend to be harbored in distinct brain circuits memory encoding of these threats seems to rely on a shared learning system

Acute_Threat_Fear	panic comorbidity with bipolar disorder what is the manic panic connection bipolar panic comorbidity has been observed in clinical community and familial samples as both are episodic disorders of affect regulation the common pathophysiological mechanism is likely to involve deficits in amygdala mediated plasticity dependent emotional conditioning neuronal genesis and synaptic remodeling occur in the amygdala bipolar and panic disorders have both been associated with abnormality in the amygdala and related structures as well as in molecules that modulate plasticity such as serotonin norepinephrine brain derived neurotrophic factor and corticotrophin releasing factor these biological elements are involved in behavioral conditioning to threat and reward panic attacks resemble the normal acute fear response but are abnormally dissociated from any relevant threat abnormal reward seeking behavior is central to both manic and depressive syndromes appetites can be elevated or depressed satisfaction of a drive may fail to condition future behavior these dissociations may be the result of deficits in plasticity dependent processes of conditioning within different amygdala subregions this speculative model may be a useful framework with which to connect molecular cellular anatomic and behavioral processes in panic and bipolar disorders the primary clinical implication is that behavioral treatment may be critical to restore function in some bipolar patients who respond only partially to medications

public psychiatric institution if the court reaches the conclusion that this person poses a threat to public safety num individuals who have broken the law and deemed not guilty by reason of insanity are treated in psychiatric units of psychiatric hospitals according to the article num of the penal code in athens in the psychiatric hospital of athens and the dromokaiteion psychiatric hospital and in thessaloniki in the unit for not guilty by reason of insanity the person who is deemed not guilty by reason of insanity following a crime is facing double stigmatisation and marginalisation from both the legal and the health system he she is usually treated initially with fear and later since there is no therapeutic aim but only the court instruction for guardianship with indifference the patient who is committed by the courts in a psychiatric unit for being is facing a unique legal and psychiatric status num in this respect he she is disadvantaged when compared to either convicted criminals or psychiatric inpatients if the patient was not found ie innocent as far as sentencing is concerned he would have been punished with loss of liberty for a certain specific amount of time and like all individuals convicted in court he she would have the right to appeal and reduce his her sentence in a higher court and maybe released from prison earlier for good behaviour etc in this respect the individual found to be is disadvantaged when compared to a convicted felon since he she is kept for an undefined period of time additionally he she will be allowed to leave the psychiatric unit following a subjective assessment of a judge with no psychiatric knowledge who will decide that this certain individual has ceased to be dangerous these problems are accentuated by the difficulties that the greek justice system is facing on the other side from the psychiatric point of view the patient who is an inpatient is not receiving the holistic bio psycho social treatment and assessment of needs he she requires the psychiatric team looking after him once the acute symptomatology is controlled is just getting used to a patient who will not be discharged in the immediate future these patients form the new chronic asylum psychiatric inpatients for whom the treating psychiatrists are not allowed to discharge back into the community whilst it is unclear whether they can be transferred to supported rehabilitation units it is a medical but also legal paradox to assign to contemporary psychiatric units aiming mainly to treat patients in the community to keep and guard inpatients whilst these psychiatric units should focus on care and rehabilitation of the patients including the ngris num keeping patients like these in psychiatric units creates problems in the functioning of the units these patients are kept in acute beds for long periods of time num to num years minimum with patients treated voluntarily or against their will and cannot be discharged without a court s decision the problems are obvious if one realises that the average time of hospitalisation is not exceeding num months for the vast majority of psychiatric patients with the prolonged stay patients of the article num ngris they not only burden the already limited resources there is an established lack of psychiatric beds nationwide but also this prolonged hospitalisation increases their stigmatisation and marginalisation thus the prolonged hospitalisation for safety reasons according to the court decision leads to the absence of a therapeutic aim other than maintaining the patient on the ward greece has agreed that there is an urgent need in developing community psychiatry services and closure transformation of the big psychiatric hospitals asylums it is impossible to close hospitals where ngris are kept the decision to move them into the community is not a medical psychiatric but a legal one in this respect it is imperative to establish a forensic psychiatric unit for these patients in our country as the psychargos external evaluation highlighted there are great gaps in the provision of forensic psychiatric services num it must be emphasised that these gaps affect negatively psychiatric reform and social reintegration not only for the forensic psychiatric patients but for the whole of mentally ill individuals given that forensic psychiatric services are developed in athens and thessaloniki and that training in forensic psychiatry has moved forward it is imperative that the state should build upon the existing knowledge and experience and create specialist forensic units aiming to treat and rehabilitate this special and important group of patients num only when the patients found not guilty by reasons of insanity have their own safe for the society and them therapeutic and rehabilitative services the aim of de institutionalisation will be visible and realistic to implement

Acute_Threat_Fear	emotions and illness this paper discusses issues central to emotional expression in illness its aim is to challenge the psychopathological paradigm currently utilized within healthcare and propose an alternative model based on healthy emotions emotions are important to human survival it is argued that most patients will have an emotional response to their illness but anxiety and depression are unlikely to be representative of most patients experience the paper focuses on two important negative emotions fear and sadness and their psychopathological associates anxiety and depression problems of diagnosing anxiety and depression in practice are highlighted it is contended that emotional reaction to illness is normal and that emotions expressed are likely to hold clues to individual adaptation it is argued that in health care emotions should be assessed as healthy reactions to a survival threat and merit study from this perspective if we wish to understand individual patient illness reaction and adaptation better literature from cardiology is used to illustrate clinical problems given the present knowledge of emotions it should be possible to utilize emotion theory as a paradigm for studying human reaction to illness this in turn could help shape studies on adherence and adaptation the reaction and experience of patient illness is unlikely to be understood through the psychopathology paradigm better understanding of patient reaction to their illness is more likely to emerge through the study of basic emotions during acute life threatening episodes

Arousal	mood dimensions show distinct within subject associations with non exercise activity in adolescents an ambulatory assessment study physical activity is known to preserve both physical and mental health however the physical activity levels of a large proportion of adolescents are insufficient this is critical since physical activity levels in youth have been shown to translate into adulthood whereas in adult populations mood has been supposed to be one important psychological factor that drives physical activity in everyday life this issue has been poorly studied in adolescent populations ambulatory assessment is the state of the art approach to investigate how mood and non exercise activity fluctuate within persons in everyday life through assessments in real time and real life this method provides ecological validity bypassing several limitations of traditional assessment methods e g recall biases to investigate whether mood is associated with non exercise activity in adolescents we equipped a community based sample comprising num participants aged num num years with triggered e diaries querying for valence energetic arousal and calmness and with accelerometers continuously measuring physical activity in their everyday lives for num week we excluded all acceleration data due to participants exercise activities and thereafter we parameterized non exercise activity as the mean value across num min intervals of movement acceleration intensity following each e diary prompt we used multilevel analyses to compute the effects of the mood dimensions on non exercise activity within num min intervals directly following each e diary prompt additionally we conducted explorative analyses of the time course of the effects i e on different timeframes of non exercise activity up to num min following the mood assessment the results showed that valence p num num and energetic arousal p num num were positively associated with non exercise activity within the num min interval whereas calmness p num num was negatively associated with non exercise activity specifically adolescents who felt more content full of energy or less calm were more physically active in subsequent timeframes overall our results demonstrate significant associations of mood with non exercise activity in younger ages and converge with the previously observed association between mood and physical activity in adults this knowledge on distinct associations of mood dimensions with non exercise activity may help to foster physical activity levels in adolescents
Arousal	the effects of autobiographic sexual memory recall on the sexual response of sexually functional men in this experimental study we investigated how recalling positive negative and affectively neutral autobiographic sexual experiences in their personal history affected the current sexual response of sexually functional male volunteers based on an attentional capacity account of sexual arousal we predicted that affectively charged autobiographic sexual memory recall both with negative and positive valence would negatively impact genital arousal compared to recalling affectively neutral sexual experiences we expected that subjective sexual arousal would not be differentially affected by emotional memory valence we measured subjective and genital response to erotic video fragments in sexually functional volunteers num in a within subjects repeated measures design for the memory manipulation participants received instructions to visualize and mentally re experience positive negative and neutral sexual episodes from autobiographic memory memory instructions were found to result in the expected affective states as predicted compared to recalling neutral memory mean genital response was significantly lower during recalling positive and negative memory however contrary to prediction subjective sexual arousal was affected when multilevel analysis was performed including a time effect the implications of the findings were discussed with respect to the advancement of theory and therapeutic intervention
Arousal	is running away right the behavioral activation behavioral inhibition model of anterior asymmetry the measurement of anterior electroencephalograph asymmetries has become an important standard paradigm for the investigation of affective states and traits findings in this area are typically interpreted within the motivational direction model which suggests a lateralization of approach and withdrawal motivational systems to the left and right anterior region respectively however efforts to compare this widely adopted model with an alternative account which relates the left anterior region to behavioral activation independent of the direction of behavior approach or withdrawal and the right anterior region to goal conflict induced behavioral inhibition are rare and inconclusive therefore the authors measured the in a sample of num young men during emotional imagery designed to provide a critical test between the num models the results e g a correlation between left anterior activation and withdrawal motivation favor the alternative model on the basis of the concepts of behavioral activation and behavioral inhibition in addition the present study also supports an association of right parietal activation with physiological arousal and the conceptualization of parietal asymmetry as a mediator of emotion related physiological arousal
Arousal	emotional empathic responses to dynamic negative affective stimuli is gender dependent empathy entails the ability to recognize emotional states in others and feel for them since empathy does not take place in a static setting paradigms utilizing more naturalistic dynamic stimuli instead of static stimuli are perhaps more suited to grasp the origin of this highly complex social skill the study was set up to test the effect of stimulus dynamics and gender on empathic responses participants were num healthy volunteers num males aged num num years on average behavioral empathy was tested with the multifaceted empathy test including static emotional stimuli and the multidimensional movie empathy test including dynamic stimuli findings showed emotional empathy responses were higher to negative emotional stimuli in both tasks i e using static as well as dynamic stimuli interestingly a gender dependent response was only seen in the using dynamic stimuli it was shown that females felt more aroused and were more concerned with people in negative affective states it was concluded that the is suited to study gender differences in
Arousal	the pursuit of happiness measurement a psychometric model based on psychophysiological correlates everyone is interested in the pursuit of happiness but the real problem for the researchers is how to measure it our aim was to deeply investigate happiness measurement through biomedical signals using psychophysiological methods to objectify the happiness experiences measurements the classic valence arousal model of affective states to study happiness has been extensively used in psychophysiology however really few studies considered a real combination of these two dimensions and no study further investigated multidimensional models more most studies focused mainly on self report to measure happiness and a deeper psychophysiological investigation on the dimensions of such an experience is still missing multidimensional model of happiness is presented and both the dimensions and the measures extracted within each dimension are comprehensively explained this multidimensional model aims at being a milestone for future systematic study on psychophysiology of happiness and affective states
Arousal	does it matter how you ask self reported emotions to depictions of need of help and social context when humans observe other people s emotions they not only can relate but also experience similar affective states this capability is seen as a precondition for helping and other prosocial behaviors our study aims to quantify the influence of help related picture content on subjectively experienced affect it also assesses the impact of different scales on the way people rate their emotional state the participants num of this study were shown stimuli with help related content in the first subset half the drawings depicted a child or a bird needing help to reach a simple goal the other drawings depicted situations where the goal was achieved the second subset showed adults either actively helping a child or as passive bystanders we created control conditions by including pictures of the adults on their own participants were asked to report their affective responses to the stimuli using two types of num point scales for one half of the pictures scales of arousal calm to excited and of bipolar valence unhappy to happy were employed for the other half unipolar scales of pleasantness and unpleasantness strong to absent were used even non dramatic depictions of simple need of help situations were rated systematically lower in valence higher in arousal less pleasant and more unpleasant than corresponding pictures with the child or bird not needing help the presence of a child and adult together increased pleasantness ratings compared to pictures in which they were depicted alone arousal was lower for pictures showing only an adult than for those including a child depictions of active helping were rated similarly to pictures showing a passive adult bystander when the need of help was resolved aggregated unipolar pleasantness and unpleasantness ratings accounted well for arousal and even better for bipolar valence ratings and for content effects on them this is the first study to report upon the meaningful impact of harmless need of help content on self reported emotional experience it provides the basis for further investigating the links between subjective emotional experience and active prosocial behavior it also builds upon recent findings on the correspondence between emotional ratings on bipolar and unipolar scales
Arousal	please be logical am in a bad mood an electrophysiological study of mood effects on reasoning several behavioral studies have reported a detrimental effect of emotion on reasoning tasks either when the content of the reasoning and or the mood state of the individual are emotionally loaded however the neural mechanisms involved in this phenomena remain largely unexplored in an event related potentials erps study we examined the consequences of an induced mood over the electrophysiological signals obtained while processing logical and illogical categorical conclusions prior to performing a syllogism reading task we aimed to induce by using short film clips high arousal negative and positive moods and neutral affective states to participants in three separate recording sessions our mood induction procedure was only successful at inducing a highly arousing negative state behaviorally participants committed more errors overall while judging the invalidity versus the validity of illogical and logical conclusions respectively but no influences from mood state emerged at this logical validity task electrophysiologically and overall a negative going deflection was larger for illogical relative to logical conclusions in a parietal region between num and ms however further analysis revealed that the logical conclusions were only more expected smaller amplitudes in the negative relative to the neutral and the positive sessions providing support to theoretical views that posit that a more analytic reasoning style might be implemented under a negative mood state these results provide further electrophysiological evidence of the influence of mood on other cognitive processes particularly on the anticipation and processing of logical conclusions during online reasoning tasks
Arousal	post error brain activity correlates with incidental memory for negative words the present study had three main objectives first we aimed to evaluate whether short duration affective states induced by negative and positive words can lead to increased error monitoring activity relative to a neutral task condition second we intended to determine whether such an enhancement is limited to words of specific valence or is a general response to arousing material third we wanted to assess whether post error brain activity is associated with incidental memory for negative and or positive words participants performed an emotional stop signal task that required response inhibition to negative positive or neutral nouns while was recorded immediately after the completion of the task they were instructed to recall as many of the presented words as they could in an unexpected free recall test we observed significantly greater brain activity in the error positivity pe time window in both negative and positive trials the error related negativity amplitudes were comparable in both the neutral and emotional arousing trials regardless of their valence regarding behavior increased processing of emotional words was reflected in better incidental recall importantly the memory performance for negative words was positively correlated with the pe amplitude particularly in the negative condition the source localization analysis revealed that the subsequent memory recall for negative words was associated with widespread bilateral brain activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and in the medial frontal gyrus which was registered in the pe time window during negative trials the present study has several important conclusions first it indicates that the emotional enhancement of error monitoring as reflected by the pe amplitude may be induced by stimuli with symbolic ontogenetically learned emotional significance second it indicates that the emotion related enhancement of the pe occurs across both negative and positive conditions thus it is preferentially driven by the arousal content of an affective stimuli third our findings suggest that enhanced error monitoring and facilitated recall of negative words may both reflect responsivity to negative events more speculatively they can also indicate that post error activity of the medial prefrontal cortex may selectively support encoding for negative stimuli and contribute to their privileged access to memory
Arousal	improving emotion recognition systems by embedding cardiorespiratory coupling this work aims at showing improved performances of an emotion recognition system embedding information gathered from cardiorespiratory coupling here we propose a novel methodology able to robustly identify up to num regions of a two dimensional space model namely the well known circumplex model of affect the novelty of embedding coupling information in an autonomic nervous system based feature space better reveals the sympathetic activations upon emotional stimuli synchrogram analysis was used to quantify such a coupling in terms of number of heartbeats per respiratory period physiological data were gathered from num healthy subjects emotionally elicited by means of affective pictures of the international affective picture system database in this study we finely detected five levels of arousal and five levels of valence as well as the neutral state whose combinations were used for identifying num different affective states in the plane we show that the inclusion of the bivariate measures in a previously developed system based only on monovariate measures of heart rate variability respiration dynamics and electrodermal response dramatically increases the recognition accuracy of a quadratic discriminant classifier obtaining more than num of correct classification per class finally we propose a comprehensive description of the coupling during sympathetic elicitation adapting an existing theoretical nonlinear model with external driving the theoretical idea behind this model is that the system is comprised of weakly coupled self sustained oscillators that when exposed to an external perturbation i e sympathetic activity becomes synchronized and less sensible to input variations given the demonstrated role of the coupling this model can constitute a general tool which is easily embedded in other model based emotion recognition systems

Arousal	association of major depressive disorder with altered functional brain response during anticipation and processing of heat pain chronic pain and depression are highly comorbid conditions yet little is known about the neurobiological basis of pain processing in major depressive disorder to examine the neural substrates underlying anticipation and processing of heat pain in a group of unmedicated young adults with current functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging data were collected during an event related factorial experimental pain paradigm painful and nonpainful heat stimuli were applied to the left volar forearm while different color shapes explicitly signaled the intensity of the upcoming stimulus university brain imaging center patients fifteen num female young adults with current and num num female healthy subjects with no history of were recruited and matched for age and level of education the structured clinical interview for was administered to all participants by a board certified psychiatrist main outcome measure between group differences in blood oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging signal change to anticipation and processing of painful vs nonpainful temperature stimuli subjects with compared with healthy controls showed num increased activation in the right anterior insular region dorsal anterior cingulate and right amygdala during anticipation of painful relative to nonpainful stimuli num increased activation in the right amygdala and decreased activation in periaqueductal gray matter and the rostral anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices during painful stimulation relative to nonpainful stimulation and num greater activation in the right amygdala during anticipation of pain which was associated with greater levels of perceived helplessness these findings suggest that increased emotional reactivity during the anticipation of heat pain may lead to an impaired ability to modulate pain experience in future studies should examine the degree to which altered functional brain response during anticipatory processing affects the ability to modulate negative affective states in which is a core characteristic of this disorder
Arousal	increased sensitivity to heat pain after sad mood induction in female patients with major depression patients suffering from major depressive disorder have been shown to exhibit increased thresholds towards experimentally induced thermal pain applied to the skin in contrast the induction of sad mood can increase pain perception in healthy controls here we aimed to test the hypothesis that heat pain thresholds are further increased after sad mood induction in depressed patients thermal pain thresholds were obtained from num female depressed patients and num controls before and after sad mood induction applying a modified velten mood induction procedure valence and arousal ratings were obtained using the self assessment manikin the montgomery depression rating scale and the beck depression inventory were obtained at baseline from all participants pain thresholds at baseline did not significantly differ between groups pain thresholds and valence of mood significantly decreased both in patients and controls while arousal showed an inverse time course between groups therefore our hypothesis could not be confirmed from these data we propose that the depressed mood as seen in patients influences pain experience differently as compared to the shorter lasting mood change after differential interaction of both affective states with brain areas of the pain matrix might be assumed eventually the induction of sad mood might mirror the increased number of pain complaints in depressed patients and thus adds to the current concept of adjuvant antidepressant treatment both in depressed patients with pain complaints and in chronic pain patients
Arousal	affective computing in virtual reality emotion recognition from brain and heartbeat dynamics using wearable sensors affective computing has emerged as an important field of study that aims to develop systems that can automatically recognize emotions up to the present elicitation has been carried out with non immersive stimuli this study on the other hand aims to develop an emotion recognition system for affective states evoked through immersive virtual environments four alternative virtual rooms were designed to elicit four possible arousal valence combinations as described in each quadrant of the circumplex model of affects an experiment involving the recording of the electroencephalography and electrocardiography of sixty participants was carried out set of features was extracted from these signals using various state of the art metrics that quantify brain and cardiovascular linear and nonlinear dynamics which were input into a support vector machine classifier to predict the subject s arousal and valence perception the model s accuracy was num num along the arousal dimension and num num along the valence dimension our findings validate the use of immersive virtual environments to elicit and automatically recognize different emotional states from neural and cardiac dynamics this development could have novel applications in fields as diverse as architecture health education and videogames
Arousal	dog behavior but not frontal brain reaction changes in repeated positive interactions with a human a non invasive pilot study using functional near infrared spectroscopy fnirs this study was conducted as a pilot test case to investigate potential behavioral and neural indicators of positive emotional states in dogs these states were induced by subjecting each dog to three types of human interactions verbal contact only physical contact only or both each stimulus was repeated num times at num min intervals alternating with a baseline phase no interaction while behavior was observed and frontal cortical brain activation was recorded by functional near infrared spectroscopy fnirs dogs reacted similarly to all num stimuli with a consistent hemodynamic pattern regarding behavior dogs lay on their back explored the handler and performed lip licking more during exposure to the stimuli than during the baseline there was only weak evidence that the dogs behavioral reactions differed between the num stimuli but their behavior changed markedly with repetition for example the proportion of time a dog spent lying with its head resting on the floor increased whereas the probability of exploring the handler and the proportion of time spent lip licking decreased over time in contrast the hemodynamic reaction did not change with repetition the dogs reactions are consistent with the stimuli being positive the contrast between the changes in behavior with repetition and the consistency of the hemodynamic frontal cortical reaction would be in keeping with the assumption that there was a decrease in arousal as dogs habituated to the repetitions reflected by their change in behavior whereas because the valence of the stimuli remains constant there was no change in the frontal hemodynamic reaction
Arousal	oscillations of heart rate and respiration synchronize during affective visual stimulation the objective of this study is to investigate the synchronization between breathing patterns and heart rate during emotional visual elicitation that is using sets of images gathered from the international affective picture system having five levels of arousal and five levels of valence including a neutral reference level thirty five healthy volunteers were emotionally elicited in agreement with a bidimensional spatial localization of affective states i e arousal valence plane while two peripheral physiological signals and respiration activity were acquired simultaneously the synchronization was then quantified by applying the concept of phase synchronization of chaotic oscillators i e the cardio respiratory synchrogram this technique allowed us to estimate the synchronization ratio m n as the attendance of n heartbeats in each m respiratory cycle even for noisy and nonstationary data we found a stronger evidence of cardiorespiratory synchronization during arousal than during neutral states
Arousal	inducing somatic symptoms in functional syndrome patients effects of manipulating state negative affect induction of negative affective states can enhance bodily symptoms in high habitual symptom reporters among healthy persons and in patients with irritable bowel syndrome the aims of this study were to replicate this effect in patients with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome and to investigate the role of moderators focusing on alexithymia negative affectivity and absorption patients with fibromyalgia and or chronic fatigue syndrome n num and hcs n num viewed series of neutral positive and negative affective pictures after every picture series participants filled out a somatic symptom checklist and rated emotions experienced during the picture series on valence arousal and perceived control patients reported more somatic symptoms after viewing negative pictures least square mean num num standard error num num compared with neutral num num num num p num or positive num num num num p num pictures whereas somatic symptom ratings of hcs after viewing negative picture series num num num num did not differ from ratings after viewing neutral num num num num p num or positive num num num num p num pictures negative affectivity did not moderate the symptom enhancing effect of negative affective pictures whereas the alexithymia factor difficulty identifying feelings and absorption did p num and p num respectively negative affective states elicit elevated somatic symptom reports in patients experiencing fibromyalgia and or chronic fatigue syndrome this symptom enhancing effect is greater in patients having higher difficulty to identify feelings and higher absorption scores the results are discussed in a predictive coding framework of symptom perception
Arousal	in the mood for adaptation how affect regulates conflict driven control cognitive conflict plays an important role in tuning cognitive control to the situation at hand on the basis of earlier findings demonstrating emotional modulations of conflict processing we predicted that affective states may adaptively regulate goal directed behavior that is driven by conflict we tested this hypothesis by measuring conflict driven control adaptations following experimental induction of four different mood states that could be differentiated along the dimensions of arousal and pleasure after mood states were induced num subjects performed a flanker task which provided a measure of conflict adaptation as predicted pleasure level affected conflict adaptation less pleasure was associated with more conflict driven control arousal level did not influence conflict adaptation this study suggests that affect adaptively regulates cognitive control implications for future research and psychopathology are discussed
Arousal	considerations for emotion aware consumer products emotion aware consumer products require reliable short term emotion assessment i e unobtrusive robust and lacking calibration to explore the feasibility of this an experiment was conducted where the galvanic skin response and three electromyography signals frontalis corrugator supercilii and zygomaticus major were recorded on num participants who watched eight num min emotion inducing film fragments the unfiltered psychophysiological signals were processed and six statistical parameters i e mean absolute deviation standard deviation variance skewness and kurtosis were derived for each num s interval of the film fragment for each physiological signal skewness and kurtosis discriminated among affective states accompanied by other parameters depending on the signal the skewness parameter also showed to indicate mixed emotions moreover a mapping of events in the fragments on the signals showed the importance of short term emotion assessment hence this research identified generic features denoted important considerations and illustrated the feasibility of emotion aware consumer products
Arousal	physicians interactions with peers empathic accuracy during shift handovers on intensive care units we investigated how accurately physicians judge colleagues states during shift handovers on intensive care units the role of physician characteristics and how accuracy is related to handover partners satisfaction using mobile phones we assessed momentary judgements during num shift handovers by num physicians of five swiss clinics physicians rated their own and their partner s affective states we calculated the covariation of the perceiver s judgements of the partner s affect with the partner s self reported affect and the perceiver s own self reported affect we then examined the moderation of these covariations by physicians roles and experience overall resident physicians were moderately successful in taking their counterparts perspective perceiver s ratings of partner s affect and the latter s self ratings were significantly related associations between perceivers ratings of their own and their partner s affect were also evident none of the effects varied as a function of physicians roles there was an unexpected effect of job experience physicians with more experience were more likely to project their own affect into the rating of partner s affect physicians accuracy in judging the partner s tense arousal was related to the partner s satisfaction with the social interaction this effect may have been mainly driven by instances in which low tension was accurately judged however
Arousal	towards a more practical attention bias test to assess affective state in sheep tests for attention bias potentially offer more rapid assessment of affective state in animals than existing cognitive methods an attention bias test has previously been developed for sheep and validated as a measure of anxious states the num minute test assessed behavioural responses of sheep in an enclosed arena after brief exposure to the threat of a dog experiment num of the current study aimed to refine the previously developed method removing the need for a habituation period and shortening the test duration sheep were given either an anxiolytic drug an anxiogenic drug or a control treatment prior to testing to induce contrasting affective states differences in behaviour were found between the treatment groups within the first s of the test indicating the original test duration could be shortened from num s during testing num of num animals in the control and anxiolytic groups ate the novel feed offered in the test indicating it is not necessary to habituate animals to a feed container experiment num aimed to confirm the responses measured in the test were primarily towards the dog rather than other aspects of the test environment sheep exposed to an empty window at the beginning of the test behaved differently to those which were exposed to a dog indicating sheep behaviour in the test is at least partially a response to the dog third group of sheep were also tested with the dog immediately after having small data loggers attached to their necks behaviour of these sheep did not differ from the sheep tested without loggers indicating data logger attachment did not impact their behaviour in the test in both experiments treatments did not appear to modify activity zones crossed which we propose indicates the test was primarily detecting valence of the affective state rather than arousal

Arousal	alexithymia a general deficit of interoception alexithymia is a sub clinical construct traditionally characterized by difficulties identifying and describing one s own emotions despite the clear need for interoception interpreting physical signals from the body when identifying one s own emotions little research has focused on the selectivity of this impairment while it was originally assumed that the interoceptive deficit in alexithymia is specific to emotion recent evidence suggests that alexithymia may also be associated with difficulties perceiving some non affective interoceptive signals such as one s heart rate it is therefore possible that the impairment experienced by those with alexithymia is common to all aspects of interoception such as interpreting signals of hunger arousal proprioception tiredness and temperature in order to determine whether alexithymia is associated with selectively impaired affective interoception or general interoceptive impairment we investigated the association between alexithymia and self reported non affective interoceptive ability and the extent to which individuals perceive similarity between affective and non affective states both measured using questionnaires developed for the purpose of the current study in both typical individuals n num num female mean age num num years and individuals reporting a diagnosis of a psychiatric condition n num num female mean age num num years findings indicated that alexithymia was associated with poor non affective interoception and increased perceived similarity between affective and non affective states in both the typical and clinical populations we therefore suggest that rather than being specifically associated with affective impairment alexithymia is better characterized by a general failure of interoception
Arousal	effects of emotionally contagious films on changes in hemisphere specific cognitive performance in the framework of models on the lateralized involvement of the cortical hemispheres in affect and psychopathology the authors examined whether cognitive processes associated with the left and the right prefrontal cortex varied as a function of valence motivational direction or intensity of induced mood affective states cheerfulness anxiety sadness anger and neutral mood were experimentally induced by short emotionally contagious films findings confirmed that the newly developed films were suitable to effectively elicit the expected affective states and to differentially change the dimensions of interest changes in verbal versus figural fluency performance were examined as a function of positive versus negative valence approach versus withdrawal motivation and low versus high emotional arousal level of interest was evaluated as a control both the tendency to withdraw and emotional arousal seemed to produce relative advantages for cognitive processes that are more strongly represented in the right than left prefrontal cortex findings suggest that changes in cognitive performance might be best explained by an additive combination of motivational direction and arousal

Arousal	dynamical systems interpretation of a dimensional model of emotion the dimensional structure of emotion was investigated using self reports of induced mood and idiographic and nomothetic analyses subjects attended four experimental sessions during which an array of affective states was induced via auditory visual and imaginal channels for each of num stimulus events subjects self rated their response factor analysis yielded the predicted bipolar factors of valence and arousal these were obtained in group aggregated analysis and subsequently confirmed as change dimensions at the intraindividual level controversy over the fundamental dimensions of affective space was considered with respect to methodological issues such as factor rotation and sampling of data space valence and arousal are discussed as motivational driving parameters of affective experience and a dynamical systems conceptualization of emotion is proposed
Arousal	modulation of spinal reflexes by aversive and sexually appetitive stimuli in this study modulation of spinal tendinous reflexes by sexual stimulation was investigated reflexes are augmented in states of appetitive and defensive action and modified by differences in arousal intensity reflexes were expected to be facilitated by both pleasant sexual and unpleasant anxiety stimuli subjects were exposed to a sexual an anxiety inducing a sexually threatening and a neutral film excerpt genital arousal emotional experience subjective action tendencies and reflexes were monitored self report and genital data confirmed the affective states as intended reflex amplitude significantly increased during viewing of emotionally arousing film excerpts as compared with a neutral film excerpt reflexes were facilitated by the sex stimulus to the same extent as by the anxiety and sexual threat stimuli the results support the view of sexual arousal as an emotional state generating sex specific autonomic and general somatic motor system responses which prepare the organism for action
Arousal	affective and metabolic responses to hypnosis autogenic relaxation and quiet rest in the supine and seated positions this study examined the influence of hypnosis autogenic relaxation and quiet rest on selected affective states and metabolism the influence of body position seated vs supine on these same outcome measures was also investigated anxiety tension and overall mood were assessed before and num minutes after each treatment and oxygen uptake was measured continuously state anxiety tension and a general measure of mood were reduced significantly following each intervention but oxygen uptake did not change with the exception of small transient alterations during the physical challenges performed in the hypnosis condition it is concluded that administration of a routine hypnosis induction to healthy individuals results in a reduction of state anxiety and an improvement of mood commensurate with effects achieved by autogenic training and quiet rest and these effects occur in both the supine and seated position
Arousal	female sexual response patterns interactions of physiological affective and contextual cues this study examined physiological affective and contextual components of female sexual responsiveness and satisfaction fifty five women aged num to num num of whom were married participated in two psychophysiological laboratory sessions and completed a questionnaire during each laboratory session physiological and self reported sexual arousal were measured in response to an erotic tape film and self generated fantasies vaginal pulse amplitude responses showed married women to be less aroused to erotic materials during session num but not session num self reported sexual arousal was correlated with vaginal response only in the unmarried sample and only during the tape and film of session num subjectively reported sexual arousal was also correlated with a constellation of positive affective states generally negative correlations were found between vaginal response in the laboratory and reported sexual responsiveness at home the patterning of the affective physiological relationships suggests several interpretations with regard to female sexuality and models to human emotion
Arousal	affective and physiological sexual response patterns the effects of instructions on sexually functional and dysfunctional men to more clearly characterize the patterns of cognitive affective and physiological responses concomitant with male sexual dysfunction the present study compared num sexually dysfunctional and num sexually functional men all individuals listened to two sexually explicit tapes and engaged in a self generated fantasy while genital heart rate and scaled cognitive affective responses were recorded two types of instructions a performance demand set and a non demand sensate focus set preceded the erotic tapes in counterbalanced order as predicted dysfunctional men showed less genital tumescence to tapes preceded by the demand than the non demand instructions contrary to expectation functional men showed greater penile tumescence to the tapes preceded by demand instructions self reported sexual arousal did not follow the penile tumescence pattern but instead indicated that the dysfunctional sample was significantly less subjectively aroused to the tapes and fantasy there were other significant differences between the groups dysfunctional men showed greater general psychological distress as measured by the num including elevated somaticism anxiety and depression scores during the experimental session dysfunctional men also evidenced greater awareness of a variety of physiological responses as well as more negative and fewer positive cognitive affective states these data are discussed in terms of the interaction of affective and physiological responses differences in contextual meanings of instructional sets given the presence of a dysfunction and theoretical and clinical conceptualizations of male sexual functioning
Arousal	the multiple affect adjective check list subscale intercorrelations from two independent studies found the the anxiety depression and hostility subscales to be intercorrelated in two independent studies num thus raising doubts about their validity as measures of separate affective states it is suggested that the scores of the subscales may usefully be summed to produce a measure of general negative affect
Arousal	compulsive use of dopaminergic drug therapy in parkinson s disease reward and anti reward few parkinson patients develop a disabling pattern of compulsive dopaminergic drug use dopamine dysregulation syndrome patients commonly identify aversive dysphoric mood states as a primary motivation to compulsively use their drugs we compared motoric affective non motor symptoms and incentive arousal after overnight medication withdrawal and after levodopa in and control patients twenty patients were matched to num control patients for age gender and disease duration and underwent a standard levodopa challenge somatic symptomatology positive and negative affective states drug effects reward responsivity motor disability and dyskinesias were tested in the state after overnight withdrawal of medications and then after a challenge with a standard dose of levodopa after a full state was achieved in the state patients reported lower positive affect and more motor and non motor disability in the state patients had higher expressions of drug wanting reward responsivity and dyskinesias positive and negative affect non motor symptomatology and motor disability were comparable these findings suggest that affective motivational and motoric disturbances in are associated with the transition to compulsive drug use in individuals who inappropriately overuse their dopaminergic medication

Arousal	the usefulness of measuring glucocorticoids for assessing animal welfare glucocorticoids corticosterone in birds and rodents and cortisol in all other mammals are glucoregulatory hormones that are synthesized in response to a range of stimuli including stress and are regularly measured in the assessment of animal welfare glucocorticoids have many normal or non stress related functions and glucocorticoid synthesis can increase in response to pleasure excitement and arousal as well as fear anxiety and pain often when assessing animal welfare little consideration is given to normal non stress related glucocorticoid functions or the complex mechanisms that regulate the effects of glucocorticoids on physiology in addition it is rarely acknowledged that increased glucocorticoid synthesis can indicate positive welfare states or that a stress response can increase fitness and improve the welfare of an animal in this paper we review how and when glucocorticoid synthesis increases the actions mediated through type and type glucocorticoid receptors the importance of corticosteroid binding globulin the role of num beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and the key aspects of neurophysiology relevant to activating the hypothalamo pituitary adrenal axis this is discussed in the context of animal welfare assessment particularly under the biological functioning and affective states frameworks we contend that extending the assessment of animal welfare to key brain regions afferent to the hypothalamus and incorporating the aspects of glucocorticoid physiology that affect change in target tissue will advance animal welfare science and inspire more comprehensive assessment of the welfare of animals
Arousal	feasibility and effects of a brief compassion focused imagery intervention in psychotic patients with paranoid ideation randomized experimental pilot study paranoia is characterized by a lack of perceived social safeness and associated negative affect low self esteem negative self concepts and negative emotions have been shown to contribute to paranoid symptom formation thus interventions focusing on affiliation and positive affect might be particularly helpful for patients with paranoia the present study experimentally tested the effect of a one session brief compassion focused imagery derived from compassion focused therapy gilbert versus a control imagery condition in a repeated measures randomized design negative affective state was induced via in sensu exposure to a recent distressful social situation in order to provide a minimum level of threat related arousal to be down regulated by the interventions thereafter the sample consisted of psychotic patients with paranoid ideation num who were randomly assigned to one of the experimental conditions effects on postulated causal mechanisms i e self relating self reassurance self compassion self criticism and affect self reported affective states skin conductance levels as well as on state paranoia were tested subjective benefit and appraisals of the intervention were explored there were no specific intervention effects on negative self relating negative affect and skin conductance or on paranoia however compassion focused imagery had significant effects on self reassurance and happiness explorative analyses revealed that the majority of the participants appraised the intervention in a positive manner indicating good acceptance the intervention showed an effect on some of the postulated mechanisms but not on others which might have been because of its brevity further investigation of interventions targeting affiliation for people with paranoid experiences appears worthwhile copyright c num john wiley sons ltd affiliative imagery work is feasible and appraised positively in psychotic patients brief compassion focused imagery increased feelings of happiness and reassurance but did not improve negative self relating negative affect or paranoia further investigation is warranted to identify which patients benefit most from affiliative imagery
Arousal	identification of trichotillomania cue profiles to explore the usefulness of emotional and environmental cues in distinguishing different patterns and potential subtypes of hair pulling in trichotillomania we looked at the responses of num chronic hair pullers who had identified relevant cues for hair pulling from a num item list principal components analysis suggested two independent components which were important to hair pulling one distinguished by negative affective states and the other by sedentary activities and contemplative attitudes high scores were related to hair pulling which was the focus of the ss attention as well as with increased prevalence of lifetime obsessive compulsive disorder other anxiety disorders current and past depression and obsessive compulsive personality disorder high scores were related to a history of major depression only weighted scores on these components may be useful in further elaborating the phenomenology of trichotillomania and designing appropriate treatment interventions
Arousal	the affective beneficence of vigorous exercise revisited high exercise intensity may be associated with reduced adherence to exercise programmes possibly because it is perceived as aversive however several authors have suggested that an intensity as high as num or num of maximal aerobic capacity max is necessary for exercise to elicit positive affective changes to elucidate this discrepancy the affective responses to increasing levels of exercise intensity were examined in total num volunteers rated their affect every minute as they ran on a treadmill while the speed and grade were progressively increased the methodology was unique in three respects num affect was assessed in terms of the dimensions of the circumplex model instead of distinct affective states num affect was assessed repeatedly before during and after exercise not only before and after and num exercise intensity was standardized across participants in terms of metabolically comparable phases beginning ventilatory threshold max instead of percentages of maximal capacity pre to post exercise comparisons indicated affective benefits in the form of increased energetic arousal and decreased tense arousal during exercise however affective valence deteriorated beyond the ventilatory threshold and until max a trend that reversed itself instantaneously during cool down exercise intensity that requires a transition to anaerobic metabolism can have a transient but substantial negative impact on affect and this may in turn reduce adherence to exercise programmes
Arousal	cognitive organization of emotion differences between labels and descriptors of emotion in jealousy situations the purpose of this study was to ascertain whether the cognitive organization of labels of emotion differs from descriptions of affective states this was done in the context of determining whether the attributions of labels of emotion and descriptions of affective responses in jealousy situations differed according to the status of the interloper presence of an audience to the untoward behavior and sex of the respondent the subjects num male and female junior college students read vignettes which placed them at a party where their mates passionately kissed interlopers of varying status and whose transgressions were or were not observed by others the subjects were required to indicate the likelihood that they would experience anger disgust fear jealousy sadness and surprise and num cognitive and physiological descriptions of the affective states referred to by the aforementioned labels of emotion different findings were obtained with the labels and descriptors of affective states this was interpreted as support for the systems theory of schwartz the descriptions but not the labels indicated that men were most upset when the interloper was a best friend and least concerned when he was a stranger in contrast women were most upset when the interloper was someone of equal or lower status than themselves and least upset when the interloper was their best friend
Arousal	affective neuroscientific and neuropsychoanalytic approaches to two intractable psychiatric problems why depression feels so bad and what addicts really want the affective foundations of depression and addictions are discussed from a cross species animal to human perspective of translational psychiatric research depression is hypothesized to arise from an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to terminate protracted activation of separation distress systems of the brain a shutdown mechanism which may be in part mediated by down regulation of dopamine based reward resources this shutdown of the brain s core motivational machinery is organized by shifts in multiple peptide systems particularly increased dynorphin kappa opioids addictions are conceived to be primarily mediated by obsessive behaviors sustained by reward circuits in the case of psychostimulant abuse and also powerful consummatory responses in the case of opioid abuse which in turn capture circuits both forms of addiction as well as others eventually deplete reward resources leading to a state of dysphoria which can only temporarily be reversed by drugs of abuse thereby promoting a negative affect that sustains addictive cycles in other words the opponent affective process the dysphoria of diminished resources that can be aroused by sustained over arousal of separation distress as well as direct pharmacological over stimulation and depletion of resources may be a common denominator for the genesis of both depression and addiction envisioning the foundation of such psychiatric problems as being in imbalances of the basic mammalian emotional systems that engender prototype affective states may provide more robust translational research strategies coordinated with rather than simply focusing on the underlying molecular dynamics emotional vocalizations might be one of the best ways to monitor the underlying affective dynamics in commonly used rodent models of psychiatric disorders
Arousal	cardiovascular changes during induced emotion an application of lang s theory of emotional imagery studies of emotion have provided occasional support for physiological differentiation of affective states however the evidence has been inconsistent the aims of the present study were to investigate cardiovascular changes associated with relived experiences of happiness sadness anger fear and disgust and to examine the utility of methods designed to optimize the induction of emotional responses thirty four undergraduates who scored num num sd above the mean on larsen and diener s affect intensity measure described their most intense experiences of five emotions these descriptions were then used to induce those emotions while blood pressure and other hemodynamic measures were monitored systolic blood pressure diastolic blood pressure and stroke volume differentiated among emotions the results support the suggestion that cardiovascular activity differentiates emotional states and provide some insight into the physiological adjustments subserving such effects the study demonstrates a method that may be applied to studies of discrete emotions
Arousal	anxiety and depression in patients receiving implanted cardioverter defibrillators a longitudinal investigation the implantable cardioverter defibrillator has dramatically improved survival rates following sudden cardiac death episodes however researchers have devoted little attention to the psychosocial consequences of living with the device the current study used a longitudinal design to evaluate the impact of adaptation to the on incidence and severity of anxiety and depression recipients were administered standardized anxiety and depression questionnaires as well as questions evaluating quality of life related to the in two consecutive yearly assessments preliminary evaluation of potentially important theoretical variables such as the perceived predictability and controllability of shock onset was also conducted one third of the study population num had clinically significant levels of anxiety depressed mood and fear of symptoms of autonomic arousal these negative affective states persisted over time with num to num percent of subjects continuing to have ongoing difficulties over a one year time period anxiety about the firing was closely associated with the occurrence of depression while avoidance of activities was associated with anxiety worry about the and a belief that firing can be predicted were associated with anxiety sensitivity depressive and anxiety states in recipients may be frequent clinically significant and resistant to spontaneous resolution early signs of anxiety and depression in recipients should be evaluated implications for future research are discussed
Arousal	meclizine enhancement of sensorimotor gating in healthy male subjects with high startle responses and low prepulse inhibition histamine receptor systems have been shown in animal studies to have important roles in the reversal of sensorimotor gating deficits as measured by prepulse inhibition antagonist treatment attenuates the impairments caused by either blockade of glutamate receptors or facilitation of dopamine transmission the current experiment brought the investigation of effects on sensorimotor gating to human studies the effects of the histamine antagonist meclizine on the startle response and were investigated in healthy male subjects with high baseline startle responses and low levels meclizine was administered to participants n num using a within subjects design with each participant receiving num num num and num mg of meclizine in a counterbalanced order startle response heart rate response galvanic skin response and changes in self report ratings of alertness levels and affective states arousal and valence were assessed when compared with the control placebo condition the two doses of meclizine analyzed num num and num mg produced significant increases in without affecting the magnitude of the startle response or other physiological variables meclizine also caused a significant increase in overall self reported arousal levels which was not correlated with the observed increase in these results are in agreement with previous reports in the animal literature and suggest that antagonists may have beneficial effects in the treatment of subjects with compromised sensorimotor gating and enhanced motor responses to sensory stimuli
Arousal	emotional perception and neuroendocrine changes the present study was designed to investigate the neuroendocrine modifications during affective states in particular we investigate if the pleasantness of the stimuli has a different effect on neuroendocrine responses to address this issue we compared the effects of pleasant neutral and unpleasant pictures on catecholamine adrenocorticotrophic hormone cortisol and prolactin plasma levels ten male participants were submitted to three experimental sessions each on one of the three experimental days a week apart in a counterbalanced order although in the subjective arousal rating pleasant erotic pictures and unpleasant stimuli pictures of mutilated bodies receive the same high score a different neuroendocrine pattern was obtained unpleasant stimuli elicited a decrease in prolactin concentration and increases in noradrenaline cortisol and levels whereas pleasant slide set viewing induced an increase in prolactin levels the results suggest that the neuroendocrine system responds selectively to affective motivationally relevant pictures
Arousal	effects of induced hyperventilation on electrodermal response habituation to agoraphobia relevant stimuli the role of hyperventilation in the aetiology of anxiety disorders was investigated in an analogue study it was hypothesised that induced hyperventilation would alter subsequent subjective and physiological responses to visually presented agoraphobic material three groups num of students were used and each was divided into two sub groups which were presented with slides of either potentially agoraphobic or neutral content during the first phase of the experiment subjects were exposed to num slides whilst their breathing rate was manipulated group was instructed to hyperventilate by asking the subjects to breathe fast and deeply group was instructed to breathe at a slow rate and group breathed normally after a recovery phase subjects were re exposed to the same visual stimuli as used in the first phase of the experiment measures of skin conductance response amplitude were obtained for each stimulus in the series in addition heart rate and respiration were monitored and subjective measures of somatic and affective states were obtained subjects also rated the pleasantness of the stimuli the hyperventilation instructions resulted in delayed electrodermal habituation relative to the other groups this finding could not be accounted for in terms of group differences in either physiological or subjective arousal
Arousal	aging emotional states and memory this study compared the relation between negative mood states and memory in young and elderly subjects forty five normal healthy young volunteers ages num num years and num normal healthy elderly volunteers ages num num years were administered a verbal list learning task and self rated scales of affective states the elderly group but not the young group consistently exhibited significant correlations between their performance on verbal recall measures and their ratings of their anxiety depression and withdrawal i e within the elderly group higher levels of negative affective states were associated with poorer memory these findings indicate that aging modulates the relation between emotional state and memory functions and they are consistent with the hypothesis that the elderly are more vulnerable than the young to the adverse effects of negative emotional states on memory therefore even in normal elderly individuals without diagnosable psychopathology negative affective states such as anxiety and depression may interfere with memory functioning
Arousal	viewing facial expressions of pain engages cortical areas involved in the direct experience of pain recent neuroimaging and neuropsychological work has begun to shed light on how the brain responds to the viewing of facial expressions of emotion however one important category of facial expression that has not been studied on this level is the facial expression of pain we investigated the neural response to pain expressions by performing functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri as subjects viewed short video sequences showing faces expressing either moderate pain or for comparison no pain in alternate blocks the same subjects received both painful and non painful thermal stimulation facial expressions of pain were found to engage cortical areas also engaged by the first hand experience of pain including anterior cingulate cortex and insula the reported findings corroborate other work in which the neural response to witnessed pain has been examined from other perspectives in addition they lend support to the idea that common neural substrates are involved in representing one s own and others affective states
Arousal	affective and inflammatory responses among orchestra musicians in performance situation number of studies have shown that mental challenge under controlled experimental conditions is associated with elevations in inflammatory markers such as interleukin num num and reactive protein however relatively little work has been done on the effects of naturalistic stressors on acute changes in inflammatory markers the present study examined whether perceived arousal valence and dominance in musicians are associated with pro inflammatory and oxidative responses to a concert situation blood and salivary samples obtained from num members of a symphony orchestra on the day of rehearsal i e control situation and on the following day of premiere concert i e test situation were used to determine changes in salivary cortisol pro inflammatory markers plasma myeloperoxidase serum plasma num oxidative stress markers paraoxonase activity and malondialdehyde and homocysteine a risk factor for vascular disease results of regression analyses showed a significant trend to increased myeloperoxidase response in individuals with low valence score both affective states valence and arousal were identified as significant predictors of cortisol response during concert in addition control levels of plasma malondialdehyde were positively correlated with differences in num levels between premiere and rehearsal r num p num pointing to higher oxidative stress in individuals with pronounced num response our results indicate that stress of public performance leads to increased concentrations of plasma num num num and salivary cortisol num in musicians the decreasing effect of pleasantness on the response was highly pronounced in non smokers r num p num suggesting a significant role of emotional valence in stress induced secretion of additional studies are needed to assess the generalizability of these findings to other naturalistic stress situations
Arousal	the influence of state and trait affect on risk behaviors a daily diary study of to characterize the influence of state and trait affect on risk behaviors men who have sex with men num completed reports of trait affect and daily reports of affect and sexual behaviors each night for up to num days analyses focused on the role of state and trait positive activation negative activation anxious arousal and sexual activation on sexual risk taking operationalized as having a sex partner a partner related risk composite and an risk behavior composite state was positively associated with having a sex partner and risk behaviors trait was positively associated with partner related risk state was negatively associated with having a sex partner and positively associated with risk behaviors trait had a negative association with partner related risk and moderated the effects of state state was negatively associated with risk behaviors and trait had a main effect on having a sex partner had no significant trait or state effects these data suggest a role for multiple affective states in sexual risk taking models of risk taking behaviors should be extended to include affective processes

Arousal	momentary affect predicts bodily movement in daily life an ambulatory monitoring study there is converging evidence that physical activity influences affective states it has been found that aerobic exercise programs can significantly diminish negative affect moreover among healthy individuals moderate levels of physical activity seem to increase energetic arousal and positive affect however the predictive utility of affective states for bodily movement has rarely been investigated in this study we examined whether momentarily assessed affect is associated with bodily movement in everyday life using a previously published data set schwerdtfeger eberhardt chmitorz num we reanalyzed num hr ecological momentary assessment data from num healthy volunteers electronic momentary positive activated affect and negative affect were assessed via handheld computers and bodily movement was recorded via accelerosensors generalized linear mixed models were calculated results indicated that increases were accompanied by bodily movement increases of varying intensity was also positively associated with increases in certain kinds of bodily movement in light of previous research this finding suggests that affect and bodily movement may have circular effects on each other
Arousal	affective individual differences and startle reflex modulation potentiation of startle has been demonstrated in experimentally produced aversive emotional states and clinical reports suggest that potentiated startle may be associated with fear or anxiety to test the generalizability of startle potentiation across a variety of emotional states as well as its sensitivity to individual differences in fearfulness the acoustic startle response of num high and num low fear adult subjects was assessed during fear anger joy sadness pleasant relaxation and neutral imagery startle responses were larger in all aversive affective states than during pleasant imagery this effect was enhanced among high fear subjects although followup testing indicated that other affective individual differences depression and anger may also be related to increased potentiation of startle in negative affect startle latency was reduced during high rather than low arousal imagery but was unaffected by emotional valence

Arousal	selective breeding for num khz ultrasonic vocalization emission produces alterations in the ontogeny and regulation of rough and tumble play ultrasonic vocalizations usvs are emitted by rodents and can signal either negative or positive affective states in social and nonsocial contexts our recent work has utilized selective breeding based upon the emission of num khz usvs in response to standard cross species hand play namely experimenters tickling rats previous work has shown that high tickle responsive animals i e rats emitting abundant num khz usvs are gregarious and express enhanced positive emotional behaviors relative to animals exhibiting low num khz usvs the present study extends this work by examining the developmental profile of play behavior and the suppression of play behavior by predator cat odor in juvenile high line and low line animals results support dissociations in key play measures between these groups with high line animals emitting more dorsal contacts during play and low line animals emitting more pinning behavior for cat odor induced play suppression we found that high line animals exhibit elevated suppression of play for a prolonged period compared to low line rats in contrast low line animals returned to normal levels of play just num day post predator odor experience these findings support the idea that emotional arousal may differ between these selectively bred groups and extends previous work by demonstrating a possible influence of altered emotional learning and conditioning in these phenotypically different animals one possibility is that high line animals exhibit enhanced associative learning abilities leading to stronger negative contextual conditioning these findings suggest that selection for positive or negative social emotional phenotypes may also segregate genes that control emotional learning abilities in unanticipated ways
Arousal	human brain indices of emotions delineating responses to affective vocalizations by measuring frontal theta event related synchronization at present there is no direct brain measure of basic emotional dynamics from the human brain provides non invasive approaches for monitoring brain electrical activity to emotional stimuli event related desynchronization synchronization analysis based on power shifts in specific frequency bands has some potential as a method for differentiating responses to basic emotions as measured during brief presentations of affective stimuli although there appears to be fairly consistent theta in frontal regions of the brain during the earliest phases of processing affective auditory stimuli the patterns do not readily distinguish between specific emotions to date it has not been possible to consistently differentiate brain responses to emotion specific affective states or stimuli and some evidence to suggests the theta more likely measures general arousal processes rather than yielding veridical indices of specific emotional states perhaps cortical patterns will never be able to be used to distinguish discrete emotional states from the surface of the brain the implications and limitations of such approaches for understanding human emotions are discussed
Arousal	electromyographic activity over facial muscle regions can differentiate the valence and intensity of affective reactions physiological measures have traditionally been viewed in social psychology as useful only in assessing general arousal and therefore as incapable of distinguishing between positive and negative affective states this view is challenged in the present report sixteen subjects in a pilot study were exposed briefly to slides and tones that were mildly to moderately evocative of positive and negative affect facial electromyographic activity differentiated both the valence and intensity of the affective reaction moreover independent judges were unable to determine from viewing videotapes of the subjects facial displays whether a positive or negative stimulus had been presented or whether a mildly or moderately intense stimulus had been presented in the full experiment num subjects briefly viewed slides of scenes that were mildly to moderately evocative of positive and negative affect again activity over the brow corrugator supercilia eye orbicularis oculi and cheek zygomatic major muscle regions differentiated the pleasantness and intensity of individuals affective reactions to the visual stimuli even though visual inspection of the videotapes again indicated that expressions of emotion were not apparent these results suggest that gradients of activity over the muscles of facial expression can provide objective and continuous probes of affective processes that are too subtle or fleeting to evoke expressions observable under normal conditions of social interaction
Arousal	verbal coercive sexual behavior among college students coercive sexual behavior exists at alarming rates on college campuses researchers attempting to identify factors related to sexual coercion have primarily investigated either the coercing college male or the coerced college female independent of relationship factors the present study investigated the prevalence of verbal sexual coercion the beliefs and attitudes of sexually coercive and noncoercive men and the differences in affective states between groups and at different stages of relationship development undergraduate students were grouped on the basis of their self reported sexual experience history as being sexually inexperienced having had consensual sexual relationships only or having had coercive sexual relationships also subjects who reported having been sexually experienced were asked to rate the nature of their relationship to their sexual partner subjects completed measures referring to sexual attitudes sexual arousal patterns and the emotional components of a sexual encounter analyses indicated that num of the males in the sample had engaged in verbal sexual coercion differences on the measures were found between the sexual experience groups and the relationship type subgroups results are discussed in the context of the situational model in which the coercive male plays an active role in shaping his environment

Arousal	recognition of affect based on gait patterns to provide a means for recognition of affect from a distance this paper analyzes the capability of gait to reveal a person s affective state we address interindividual versus person dependent recognition recognition based on discrete affective states versus recognition based on affective dimensions and efficient feature extraction with respect to affect principal component analysis kernel linear discriminant analysis and general discriminant analysis are compared to either reduce temporal information in gait or extract relevant features for classification although expression of affect in gait is covered by the primary task of locomotion person dependent recognition of motion capture data reaches num accuracy based on the observation of a single stride in particular different levels of arousal and dominance are suitable for being recognized in gait it is concluded that gait can be used as an additional modality for the recognition of affect application scenarios include monitoring in high security areas human robot interaction and cognitive home environments
Arousal	affect modulated startle in adults with childhood onset depression relations to bipolar course and number of lifetime depressive episodes to study affect regulation in adults with unipolar n num and bipolar n num forms of childhood onset depression as compared with adults with no history of psychiatric illness n num we examined affective modulation of the startle eyeblink reflex participants were subjected to binaural bursts of white noise while viewing pictures designed to elicit pleasant neutral or unpleasant affective states the blink response was recorded from surface electrodes over the orbicularis oculi muscle during and following pictures participants rated the valence and arousal of their responses unlike control or bipolar groups the unipolar group displayed a greater startle during the neutral condition than during the pleasant condition and failed to display an increase in startle during the unpleasant condition the bipolar group unlike the unipolar and control groups displayed a similar startle response after pleasant and unpleasant pictures participants with a high number of lifetime depressive episodes displayed a blunted startle response across affective conditions groups reported similar subjective responses to affective stimuli current affective symptoms and comorbid diagnoses did not influence startle modulation in unipolar and bipolar forms of unusual affective modulation or maintenance of the startle response respectively may reflect underlying deficits in affect regulation
Arousal	the neural basis of romantic love the neural correlates of many emotional states have been studied most recently through the technique of fmri however nothing is known about the neural substrates involved in evoking one of the most overwhelming of all affective states that of romantic love about which we report here the activity in the brains of num subjects who were deeply in love was scanned using fmri while they viewed pictures of their partners and compared with the activity produced by viewing pictures of three friends of similar age sex and duration of friendship as their partners the activity was restricted to foci in the medial insula and the anterior cingulate cortex and subcortically in the caudate nucleus and the putamen all bilaterally deactivations were observed in the posterior cingulate gyrus and in the amygdala and were right lateralized in the prefrontal parietal and middle temporal cortices the combination of these sites differs from those in previous studies of emotion suggesting that a unique network of areas is responsible for evoking this affective state this leads us to postulate that the principle of functional specialization in the cortex applies to affective states as well
Arousal	remembering can cause forgetting but not in negative moods repeated retrieval of a subset of previously observed events can cause forgetting of the non retrieved events we examined how affective states experienced during retrieval modulate such retrieval induced forgetting by inducing positive negative and neutral moods in subjects immediately before they attempted to retrieve studied items on the basis of recent work we hypothesized that positive moods encourage relational processing which should increase interference from related events and thus enhance retrieval induced forgetting by contrast negative moods should encourage item specific processing which should reduce interference and thus reduce such forgetting our results are consistent with these predictions when subjects were in negative moods repeated retrieval did not cause forgetting of the non retrieved material whereas when subjects were in positive and neutral moods they showed reliable retrieval induced forgetting our findings suggest that the emotions involved during interrogation of a witness can affect the result of repeated interrogations
Arousal	histories of childhood trauma and complex post traumatic sequelae in women with eating disorders the profound self destructiveness and tenacity of eating disorders found among women abused and neglected in childhood become comprehensible when understood within a complex posttraumatic conceptualization as desperate attempts to regulate overwhelming affective states and construct a coherent sense of self and system of meaning trauma leads to the predictable consequences of dysregulation of the arousal system avoidance and constriction of affect coherence of self and world are shattered abused patients childhood experiences teach them that to need is to expose oneself to the pain of abandonment and betrayal at the hands of individuals responsible for their care consequently needs psychological physical and spiritual come to be perceived as dangerous and human relationships are simultaneously yearned for and feared robbed of the opportunity to develop a cohesive self and a coherent system of meaning and faith to sustain from within the traumatized eating disorder patient turns to the culture to tell her who to be and how to live she learns that to conquer rather than satisfy needs and to be in control an internal state of equanimity manifested externally in a thin body will bring meaning and purpose binge eating purging and starving become apt metaphors for the boundless hunger the wish to fulfill needs together with the wish to rid oneself forever of need the desire to purify the damaged psychic and physical self and the hope of restoring meaning the treatment of the traumatized eating disorder patient is complex individual therapy provides the opportunity for intensive relational work that begins to restore faith in human connection and that provides a safe base from which to examine the trauma and separate past from present therapy groups for eating disordered women and trauma survivors provide relief from isolation valuable perspectives from others who have been there and the opportunity to contribute to others healing as one heals ultimately these patients must be willing to leave the world of obsession with food and weight which guarantees safety from interpersonal hurt while it simultaneously guarantees that hope will not be restored though reconnecting with humanity carries the risk of further pain it opens up the opportunity for connection healing and growth
Arousal	positive mood broadens visual attention to positive stimuli in an attempt to investigate the impact of positive emotions on visual attention within the context of fredrickson s num broaden and build model eye tracking was used in two studies to measure visual attentional preferences of college students n num n num to emotional pictures half of each sample experienced induced positive mood immediately before viewing slides of three similarly valenced images in varying central peripheral arrays attentional breadth was determined by measuring the percentage viewing time to peripheral images as well as by the number of visual saccades participants made per slide consistent with fredrickson s theory the first study showed that individuals induced into positive mood fixated more on peripheral stimuli than did control participants however this only held true for highly valenced positive stimuli participants under induced positive mood also made more frequent saccades for slides of neutral and positive valence second study showed that these effects were not simply due to differences in emotional arousal between stimuli selective attentional broadening to positive stimuli may act both to facilitate later building of resources as well as to maintain current positive affective states
Arousal	periodic motor impairments in a case of num hour bipolar ultrarapid cycling before and under treatment with valproate motor impairments of psychiatric patients can be assessed with digital recordings of handwriting tasks the investigation of patients with bipolar affective disorders differentiates intraindividual changes related to the patient s fluctuating affective states an unmedicated num year old male with num hour bipolar ultrarapid cycling was investigated during num consecutive days of ultrarapid cycling and num weeks later after remission under treatment with valproate the handwriting skills of the patient followed the same rhythmic changes of the psychopathology in the first part of the study and a steady pattern in the second phase after remission therefore it can be assumed that the handwriting skills reflect a state marker of the disease poorer handwriting skills on the manic days as compared to the depressive ones support the hypothesis of a low arousal in manic patients
Arousal	nonclinical hair pulling affective correlates and comparison with clinical samples the purposes of the current study were to examine the affective states associated with hair pulling in a nonclinical sample and to compare levels of general psychopathology in nonclinical hair pullers and clinic patients with trichotillomania or obsessive compulsive disorder subjects included num college undergraduates who engaged in hair pulling unrelated to grooming num patients with and num patients with dimensional but not categorical ratings of affective experiences in the nonclinical sample indicated that hair pulling was associated with decreases in tension boredom anger and sadness further the relationship between emotional experiences before and after hair pulling was more salient than the pre during relationship conceptualized as central in current diagnostic criteria for comparisons of psychopathology in nonclinical and clinical samples failed to support a continuum notion of increasing symptomatology in nonclinical pullers patients and individuals with some evidence of increased pathology in nonclinical pullers relative to patients was obtained as was further support for a distinction between and implications of this investigation for conceptualization of are discussed
Arousal	cybernetics activation and drug effects patients present unique combinations of familial relationships developmental idiosyncrasies social aberrations affective states cognitive abilities symptoms defects and maladaptations psychopharmacological treatments form a useful approach to cutting through this complexity to the core pathophysiology focusing on disorders that can be brought to complete remission by medication suggests that retarded and agitated depressions manic and angry hyperactive paranoid states panic disorder emotionally unstable character disorders and schizophrenias are governed by the degree of derangement of an affective activation control system defects in this control system are best conceptualized in cybernetic terms rather than in terms of the current rheostat models conceptualization of cybernetic defects allows for understanding of psychopathological developments as well as give a framework for pharmacological benefits one aspect of the activation affective disorders are disorders of two types of pleasure regulatory mechanism here referred to as appetitive and consummatory the relationship of disorders of these hedonic control mechanisms to affective states and those of drug abuse are considered this schema also affirms a close relationship between the bipolar affective disorders and the schizophrenias
Arousal	ultrasonic vocalizations of rats rattus norvegicus during mating play and aggression behavioral concomitants relationship to reward and self administration of playback rats rattus norvegicus emit a variety of ultrasonic vocalizations throughout their lifespan that reflect different forms of emotional arousal and accompanying affective states in this study high frequency recordings of ultrasonic vocalizations were made during mating aggression and both conspecific and heterospecific dubbed tickling rough and tumble play behavior we found that frequency modulated num khz calls trills and step calls were positively correlated with positively valenced appetitive behavior during mating play and aggression these calls were also positively correlated with the reward value of these social encounters however constant frequency i e flat num khz calls were not related to appetitive behaviors or reward in contrast num khz calls were positively related to aversive withdrawal behaviors during mating play and aggression finally we found that rats self administered playback of frequency modulated num khz trill calls and avoided playback of num khz calls playback of flat num khz calls or tape hiss was neutral these results suggest that frequency modulated num khz calls index a positively valenced appetitive social emotional state in rats
Arousal	biobehavioral reactivity to social evaluative stress in women with borderline personality disorder several clinical theories propose that borderline personality disorder is characterized by a biologically based affective vulnerability to intense affective experiences and impaired modulation of affective states which might manifest in high emotional intensity hyperreactivity and impaired recovery to baseline however few studies have tested these theories based on emotional and biological responses of participants in response to psychosocial stressors this study examined cortisol alpha amylase and subjective emotional reactivity to social evaluative stress among women with compared with two healthy female control groups a trait matched group scoring similarly to the group on trait measures of negative affect and impulsivity and a non trait matched group results generally suggested high emotional intensity and high baseline psychobiological arousal among individuals with but not emotional hyperreactivity or impaired recovery specific to the stressor relative to both control groups participants had higher baseline and overall subjective negative affect higher baseline cortisol levels and attenuated stress related cortisol reactivity in addition both the and groups had attenuated alpha amylase reactivity in comparison to the group the differences between and groups on most of the dependent measures suggest that emotional dysregulation in is not merely an extreme variant of normative personality traits these results suggest that women with demonstrate intense and chronic negative affectivity along with high resting psychobiological arousal and attenuated psychobiological reactivity specific to laboratory stressors
Arousal	using smartphone survey data and machine learning to identify situational and contextual risk factors for risk behavior among men who have sex with men who are not on prep just in time interventions jits delivered via smartphones have considerable potential for reducing risk behavior by providing pivotal support at key times prior to sex however these programs depend on a thorough understanding of when risk behavior is likely to occur to inform the timing of jits it is also critical to understand the most important momentary risk factors that may precede risk behavior so that interventions can be designed to address them applying machine learning methods to ecological momentary assessment data on risk behaviors can help answer both questions eighty negative men who have sex with men who were not on prep completed a daily diary survey each morning and an experience sampling survey up to six times per day via a smartphone application for num days random forest models achieved the highest area under the curve values for classifying high risk condomless anal sex these models achieved num specificity at a sensitivity value of num unsurprisingly the most important contextual risk factors that aided in classification were participants plans and intentions for sex sexual arousal and positive affective states findings suggest that survey data collected throughout the day can be used to correctly classify about three of every four high risk events while incorrectly classifying one of every five non days as involving high risk unique set of risk factors also often emerge prior to high risk events that may be useful targets for jits
Arousal	the effect of exercise on affective and self efficacy responses in older and younger women this study examined the self efficacy and affective responses to an acute exercise bout in sedentary older and younger women to determine whether aging has an effect on affective states twenty five sedentary younger mean age num num yrs and num older mean age num num yrs women completed an acute bout of exercise affective responses were measured before during and immediately following exercise self efficacy responses were measured before and immediately following exercise positive engagement revitalization tranquility felt arousal and feeling scale responses and self efficacy were all higher immediately following compared with before or during exercise for both groups of women in addition older women experienced higher overall positive engagement and lower physical exhaustion compared with younger women as well as higher tranquility and feeling scale responses immediately following exercise this investigation found that an acute bout of moderate intensity exercise produced more positive and fewer negative affective states in both younger and older women
Arousal	afferents to the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus sleep is influenced by diverse factors such as circadian time affective states ambient temperature pain etc but pathways mediating these influences are unknown to identify pathways that may influence sleep we examined afferents to the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus an area critically implicated in promoting sleep injections of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit into the produced modest numbers of labeled monoaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus raphe nuclei and ventrolateral medulla as well as a few neurons in the locus coeruleus immunohistochemistry for monoaminergic markers showed dense innervation of the by histaminergic noradrenergic and serotonergic fibers along with previous findings these results suggest that the and monoaminergic nuclei may be reciprocally connected retrograde and anterograde tracing showed moderate or heavy inputs to the from hypothalamic regions including the median preoptic nucleus lateral hypothalamic area and dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus autonomic regions including the infralimbic cortex and parabrachial nucleus and limbic regions including the lateral septal nucleus and ventral subiculum light to moderate inputs arose from orexin and melanin concentrating hormone neurons but cholinergic or dopaminergic inputs were extremely sparse suprachiasmatic nucleus projections to the were sparse but the heavy input to the from the which receives direct and indirect inputs could provide an alternate pathway regulating the circadian timing of sleep these robust pathways suggest candidate mechanisms by which sleep may be influenced by brain systems regulating arousal autonomic limbic and circadian functions
Arousal	neural mechanisms of the influence of popularity on adolescent ratings of music it is well known that social influences affect consumption decisions we used functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri to elucidate the neural mechanisms associated with social influence with regard to a common consumer good music our study population was adolescents age num num music is a common purchase in this age group and it is widely believed that adolescent behavior is influenced by perceptions of popularity in their reference group using num s clips of songs from myspace com we obtained behavioral measures of preferences and neurobiological responses to the songs the data were gathered with and without the overall popularity of the song revealed song popularity had a significant effect on the participants likability ratings of the songs fmri results showed a strong correlation between the participants rating and activity in the caudate nucleus a region previously implicated in reward driven actions the tendency to change one s evaluation of a song was positively correlated with activation in the anterior insula and anterior cingulate two regions that are associated with physiological arousal and negative affective states sensitivity to popularity was linked to lower activation levels in the middle temporal gyrus suggesting a lower depth of musical semantic processing our results suggest that a principal mechanism whereby popularity ratings affect consumer choice is through the anxiety generated by the mismatch between one s own preferences and others this mismatch anxiety motivates people to switch their choices in the direction of the consensus our data suggest that this is a major force behind the conformity observed in music tastes in some teenagers
Arousal	life events and stress reactivity as predictors of cancer coronary heart disease and anxiety disorders the topic relative to the differential psychobiological mechanisms between cancer and coronary illness has been showing for the last years in this sense some theoretical models which have been formulated by relevant authors have suggested the possibility of differentiating cancer and cardiovascular disease both the onset and the progression from coping strategies personality variables and affective states as well as the different categories of psychosocial stress likewise the implication of psychological distress such as anxiety anger and depression for the occurrence of somatic disease has been reported frequently this research was designed to analyze the psychosocial patterns which could explain the incidence of heart disease cancer and anxiety based disorders measures of life events and stress reactivity were obtained from a total of num patients diagnosed as having breast cancer num infarct num and anxiety num and from num normal control subjects our data tend to show that the cancer group was strongly predicted by lost and illness events while the coronary group was more associated with work events the anxiety disorders group lacked a life events dimension but shared the same category of the infarct group we also found a strong relationship between depressive reactions and cancer in contrast to the anxiety anger variable that was more relevant in the infarct patients the interaction between internal and external stress factors in the etiology of disease is also discussed
Arousal	odor and color of cosmetic products correlations between subjective judgement and autonomous nervous system response the color and odor of cosmetics have been shown to be crucial for affective states and able to influence autonomic responses we report an original procedure to measure the effect on subjects of the color and odor of cosmetic products and to quantify the correlation between objective psychophysiological recording and subjective psychophysics responses several cosmetic products lipsticks and nail varnishes of different colors white brown red orange and pink and odors two per product were presented in a first step autonomous parameters skin conductance and heart rate were recorded and in the second step subjects rated their sensations on subjective scales overall appreciation pleasantness and emotional arousal results indicated that certain color and odor additives in cosmetics act on relaxation excitation perceived pleasantness and emotional arousal it was also found that certain colors perceived as pleasant decreased and that the perception of an arousing perfume significantly increased
Arousal	the circumplex model of affect an integrative approach to affective neuroscience cognitive development and psychopathology the circumplex model of affect proposes that all affective states arise from cognitive interpretations of core neural sensations that are the product of two independent neurophysiological systems this model stands in contrast to theories of basic emotions which posit that a discrete and independent neural system subserves every emotion we propose that basic emotion theories no longer explain adequately the vast number of empirical observations from studies in affective neuroscience and we suggest that a conceptual shift is needed in the empirical approaches taken to the study of emotion and affective psychopathologies the circumplex model of affect is more consistent with many recent findings from behavioral cognitive neuroscience neuroimaging and developmental studies of affect moreover the model offers new theoretical and empirical approaches to studying the development of affective disorders as well as the genetic and cognitive underpinnings of affective processing within the central nervous system
Arousal	the influence of emotions on cognitive control feelings and beliefs where do they meet the influence of emotion on higher order cognitive functions such as attention allocation planning and decision making is a growing area of research with important clinical applications in this review we provide a computational framework to conceptualize emotional influences on inhibitory control an important building block of executive functioning we first summarize current neuro cognitive models of inhibitory control and show how bayesian ideal observer models can help reframe inhibitory control as a dynamic decision making process finally we propose a bayesian framework to study emotional influences on inhibitory control providing several hypotheses that may be useful to conceptualize inhibitory control biases in mental illness such as depression and anxiety to do so we consider the neurocognitive literature pertaining to how affective states can bias inhibitory control with particular attention to how valence and arousal may independently impact inhibitory control by biasing probabilistic representations of information i e beliefs and valuation processes e g speed error tradeoffs
Arousal	investigating the effects of physical discomfort on laboratory induced mood states in order to investigate the effects of physical discomfort i e pain on the induction of mood num participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions sad sad with physical discomfort happy and happy with physical discomfort consistent with our hypotheses the addition of physical discomfort resulted in a significantly stronger induction of self reported depression with these findings showing temporal specificity and persisting even after statistically controlling for stable response biases however other self reported affective states as well as cognitive and behavioral measures were not significantly affected by physical discomfort findings are discussed with regard to making the laboratory induction of sad affect more consistent with the multifaceted experience of depression
Arousal	neuroendocrine responses to experimentally induced emotions among abstinent opioid dependent subjects the present study investigated neuroendocrine and cardiovascular changes during experimentally induced affective states in abstinent heroin dependent subjects and healthy controls the procedure for eliciting emotions in all subjects used pleasant and unpleasant stimuli that did not differ in subjective arousal properties we investigated whether the valence of the stimuli differentially affected neuroendocrine responses by comparing neutral pleasant and unpleasant pictures on heart rate systolic and diastolic blood pressure methyl phenyl glycol norepinephrine epinephrine adrenocorticotrophic hormone and cortisol plasma levels twelve abstinent heroin dependent subjects in comparison with num control subjects were submitted to three experimental sessions each on one of three experimental days a week apart in counterbalanced order day num unpleasant pictures day num pleasant pictures day num neutral pictures in the rating of subjective arousal pleasant and unpleasant stimuli received the same high score in comparison with neutral stimuli a different cardiovascular and neuroendocrine pattern was obtained in healthy subjects unpleasant stimuli elicited increases in whereas neutral and pleasant stimuli did not induce any significant response in hormonal levels in contrast in heroin addicts despite increased perceptions of unpleasantness and levels did not increase after disliked stimuli these subjects also reported increased arousal during exposure to neutral stimuli in comparison with controls addicted individuals showed higher and basal levels and a consequent lack of response to unpleasant stimuli the results indicate that neuroendocrine and cardiovascular systems respond selectively to affective motivationally relevant stimuli and that substance use disorders may be associated with dysregulation of emotion processing mechanisms
Arousal	prefrontal cortex activity sympatho vagal reaction and behaviour distinguish between situations of feed reward and frustration in dwarf goats recent concepts relating to animal welfare accept that animals experience affective states these are notoriously difficult to measure in non verbal species but it is generally agreed that emotional reactions consist of well coordinated reactions in behaviour autonomic and brain activation the aim of the study was to evaluate whether each or a combination of these aspects can differentiate between situations presumed to differ in emotional content to this end we repeatedly confronted dwarf goats at short intervals with a covered and an uncovered feed bowl i e presumably frustrating and rewarding situations respectively whilst simultaneously observing their behaviour measuring heart rate and heart rate variability and haemodynamic changes in the prefrontal cortex using functional near infrared spectroscopy when faced with a covered feed bowl goats occupied themselves at locations away from the bowl and showed increased locomotion while there was a general increase in prefrontal cortical activity there was little indication of autonomic changes in contrast when feed was accessible the goats reduced locomotion focused their behaviour on the feed bowl showed signs of sympathetically mediated arousal reflecting anticipation and if any cortical activity at all was present it was concentrated to the left hemisphere we thus observed patterns in behaviour sympathetic reaction and brain activity that distinguished between a situation of frustration and one of reward in dwarf goats these patterns consisted of a well coordinated set of reactions appropriate in respect of the emotional content of the stimuli used
Arousal	autonomic nervous system activity in emotion a review autonomic nervous system activity is viewed as a major component of the emotion response in many recent theories of emotion positions on the degree of specificity of activation in emotion however greatly diverge ranging from undifferentiated arousal over acknowledgment of strong response idiosyncrasies to highly specific predictions of autonomic response patterns for certain emotions review of num publications that report experimental investigations of emotional effects on peripheral physiological responding in healthy individuals suggests considerable response specificity in emotion when considering subtypes of distinct emotions the importance of sound terminology of investigated affective states as well as of choice of physiological measures in assessing reactivity is discussed
Arousal	coffee consumption in depressive disorders it s not one size fits all caffeine is considered the world s most popular psychoactive substance its actions on the central nervous system mainly mediated by antagonism of adenosine receptors and subsequent modulation of dopaminergic activity would be particularly sought by depressed patients as an attempt of self medication however published data suggested that coffee consumption may worsen psychopathological conditions in mood disorders thus we reviewed available evidence in the literature that investigated the effects of coffee consumption on clinical development of underlying psychopathology literature research was done by typing on medline pubmed and psychinfo the key words coffee major depression coffee dysthymia the research was limited to english language publications and to studies conducted exclusively on humans although literature data are conflicting extensive follow up studies indicate a significant caffeine effect on risk reduction of developing clinical depression symptoms clinical worsening was observed mainly in cases of postpartum depression and comorbid panic disorder taking in account the study limitations we observed a biphasic profile in caffeine psychostimulant effect low to moderate doses may correlate with a reduction in depressive risk in healthy subjects and an improvement of many clinical symptoms attention arousal psychomotor performance in depressed patients whereas the assumption of high doses may result in thymic dysregulation favor mixed affective states and worsen circadian profiles and anxiety symptoms
Arousal	psychology and psychobiology of childhood trauma exposure to overwhelming stress often determines how people subsequently organize their perceptions of themselves and of others traumatic experiences at different developmental levels have different effects on cognitive affective and biological self organization acute or chronic exposure to trauma may be expressed as post traumatic stress disorder dissociative disorders somatic disturbances and alterations in perception of self and others these disorders involve a the involuntary repetitive re living of the trauma in thoughts images somatic states or behaviors b attempts to avoid dealing with reminders of the past c problems with the modulation of physiological responses to subsequent stress and d a loss of capacity to engage in love and work with pleasure and satisfaction the display of extremes of emotional distress or of bizarre or disorganized behaviors easily obscures the fact that current problems may have their origins in past trauma the recognition that many psychiatric patients organize much of their lives around repetitive patterns of re living and warding off traumatic memories reminders and affective states may help clinicians understand their symptoms as misguided attempts to regain a sense of control and safety rather than as bizarre behaviors that need to be merely controlled since safe attachments appear to be the primary way in which children learn to regulate internal state changes the negotiation of interpersonal safety needs to be the first focus of treatment since the labeling and categorization of emotional states is one of the principal areas of functioning that is disrupted by developmental trauma treatment needs to include learning how to use words to understand and interpret feelings in general and stressful events in particular since distrust and lack of social safety are critical parts of developmental trauma structure and predictability are essential identifying specific trauma based perceptions and expectations and learning how to negotiate the fulfillment of one s emotional needs are critical aspects of effective treatment
Arousal	disgust enhances the recollection of negative emotional images memory is typically better for emotional relative to neutral images an effect generally considered to be mediated by arousal however this explanation cannot explain the full pattern of findings in the literature two experiments are reported that investigate the differential effects of categorical affective states upon emotional memory and the contributions of stimulus dimensions other than pleasantness and arousal to any memory advantage in experiment num disgusting images were better remembered than equally unpleasant frightening ones despite the disgusting images being less arousing in experiment num regression analyses identified affective impact a factor shown previously to influence the allocation of visual attention and amygdala response to negative emotional images as the strongest predictor of remembering these findings raise significant issues that the arousal account of emotional memory cannot readily address the term impact refers to an undifferentiated emotional response to a stimulus without requiring detailed consideration of specific dimensions of image content we argue that ratings of impact relate to how the self is affected the present data call for further consideration of the theoretical specifications of the mechanisms that lead to enhanced memory for emotional stimuli and their neural substrates
Arousal	local back massage with an automated massage chair general muscle and psychophysiologic relaxing properties the objective of the present study was to test massage applied with an automated massage chair on the back muscles with regard to the effects on the tension of other muscles or on the neurovegetative tone and to compare three different automated massage techniques ten healthy volunteers participated in the study the experiment consisted of an initial num minute period of relaxation without massage and num minute periods of three different massage programs roll stretch massage shiatsu massage and beat massage subjects were randomized as to the presentation order the following physiologic data were collected frontalis and gastrocnemius electromyogram activity skin conductance and peripheral skin temperature judgments of valence and arousal were registered using the pencil and paper version of the five point self assessment manikin roll stretch and shiatsu massage were rated by participants as more pleasant than the relaxation period without massage or the beat massage whereas the four conditions were similar with regard to the mean frontal values reflecting primarily affective states they differed regarding the gastrocnemius relating more to a general level of tension roll stretch massage and shiatsu massage resulting in less muscle tension than the control condition shiatsu massage was associated with significantly lower skin conductance than the control condition whereas beat massage increased it significantly significant increase of skin temperature was found during the roll stretch massage compared to the no massage condition automated roll stretch massage and shiatsu massage applied on the back can rapidly induce measurable relaxation in distant muscles not directly massaged and is accompanied by signs of neurovegetative calming back massage applied by an automated massage chair may be an efficient and inexpensive general relaxation approach and is especially interesting for patients who dislike to be touched
Arousal	the autonomic differentiation of emotions revisited convergent and discriminant validation the convergent and discriminant validity of three models of physiological emotion specificity were compared forty two female students served as subjects in a num context of emotional inductions real life imagery num emotion fear anger control num happiness induced in real life context repeated measures design the dependent measures included self reports of emotion gottschalk gleser affect scores back and forearm extensor activity body movements heart period respiration period skin conductance skin temperatures pulse transit time pulse volume amplitude and blood volumes self report data confirmed the generation of affective states in both contexts as intended planned multivariate comparisons between physiological profiles established discriminant validity for fear and anger in the real life context whereas under imagery emotion profiles were essentially equal convergent validity could not be substantiated implications for models of physiological specificity of emotion were discussed
Arousal	role of serotonergic and noradrenergic systems in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety disorders there is abundant evidence for abnormalities of the norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmitter systems in depression and anxiety disorders the majority of evidence supports underactivation of serotonergic function and complex dysregulation of noradrenergic function most consistent with overactivation of this system treatment for these disorders requires perturbation of these systems reproducible increases in serotonergic function and decreases in noradrenergic function accompany treatment with antidepressants and these alterations may be necessary for antidepressant efficacy dysregulation of these systems clearly mediates many symptoms of depression and anxiety the underlying causes of these disorders however are less likely to be found within the and systems per se rather their dysfunction is likely due to their role in modulating and being modulated by other neurobiologic systems that together mediate the symptoms of affective illness clarification of noradrenergic and serotonergic modulation of various brain regions may yield a greater understanding of specific symptomatology as well as the underlying circuitry involved in euthymic and abnormal mood and anxiety states disrupted cortical regulation may mediate impaired concentration and memory together with uncontrollable worry hypothalamic abnormalities likely contribute to altered appetite libido and autonomic symptoms thalamic and brainstem dysregulation contributes to altered sleep and arousal states finally abnormal modulation of cortical hippocampal amygdala pathways may contribute to chronically hypersensitive stress and fear responses possibly mediating features of anxiety anhedonia aggression and affective dyscontrol the continued appreciation of the neural circuitry mediating affective states and their modulation by neurotransmitter systems should further the understanding of the pathophysiology of affective and anxiety disorders
Arousal	hand arm and facial actions of young infants to a social and nonsocial stimulus do num num week old infants produce differentially organized hand and arm actions in relation to affective states when presented with social and nonsocial stimuli this question was examined by observing num infants longitudinally they were observed when facing their active and passive mother and an active and passive doll during num visits at biweekly intervals videotapes were coded in real time using the following measures vocalization gaze and gaze avert for face smiling distressed and neutral for hands pointing open curled and closed and for arms extended and at side co occurrence and lag sequential analyses showed that hand actions were organized with other infant actions to form unique behavioral linkages in each of the num conditions the implications of these findings for the development of nonverbal communication are discussed
Arousal	pain and emotion effects of affective picture modulation two experiments examined the impact of viewing unpleasant pleasant and neutral photographic slides on cold pain perception in healthy men and women in each experiment participants viewed one of three slide shows experiment num fear disgust or neutral experiment num erotic nurturant or neutral immediately before a cold pressor task skin conductance and heart rate were recorded during the slide shows whereas visual analog scale ratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness thresholds and pain tolerance were recorded during the cold pressor task viewing fear and disgust slides decreased pain intensity and unpleasantness thresholds but only the fear slides decreased pain tolerance in contrast viewing erotic but not nurturant slides increased pain intensity and unpleasantness threshold ratings on the visual analog scale in men whereas neither nurturant nor erotic slides altered pain tolerance these results are consistent with a motivational priming model that predicts that unpleasant affective states should enhance pain and that pleasant affective states should attenuate it
Arousal	language origins viewed in spontaneous and interactive vocal rates of human and bonobo infants from the first months of life human infants produce protophones speech like non cry sounds presumed absent or only minimally present in other apes but there have been no direct quantitative comparisons to support this presumption in addition by num months human infants show sustained face to face interaction using protophones a pattern thought also absent or very limited in other apes but again without quantitative comparison such comparison should provide evidence relevant to determining foundations of language since substantially flexible vocalization the inclination to explore vocalization and the ability to interact socially by means of vocalization are foundations for language here we quantitatively compare data on vocalization rates in three captive bonobo pan paniscus mother infant pairs with various sources of data from our laboratories on human infant vocalization both humans and bonobos produced distress sounds cries screams and laughter the bonobo infants also produced sounds that were neither screams nor laughs and that showed acoustic similarities to the human protophones these protophone like sounds confirm that bonobo infants share with humans the capacity to produce vocalizations that appear foundational for language still there were dramatic differences between the species in both quantity and function of the protophone and protophone like sounds the bonobo protophone like sounds were far less frequent than the human protophones and the human protophones were far less likely to be interpreted as complaints and more likely as vocal play moreover we found extensive vocal interaction between human infants and mothers but no vocal interaction in the bonobo mother infant pairs while bonobo mothers were physically responsive to their infants we observed no case of a bonobo mother vocalization directed to her infant our cross species comparison focuses on low and moderate arousal circumstances because we reason the roots of language entail vocalization not triggered by excitement for example during fighting or intense play language appears to be founded in flexible vocalization used to regulate comfortable social interaction to share variable affective states at various levels of arousal and to explore vocalization itself

Arousal	the imbalanced brain from normal behavior to schizophrenia an outstanding problem in psychiatry concerns how to link discoveries about the pharmacological neurophysiological and neuroanatomical substrates of mental disorders to the abnormal behaviors that they control related problem concerns how to understand abnormal behaviors on a continuum with normal behaviors during the past few decades neural models have been developed of how normal cognitive and emotional processes learn from the environment focus attention and act upon motivationally important events and cope with unexpected events when arousal or volitional signals in these models are suitably altered they give rise to symptoms that strikingly resemble negative and positive symptoms of schizophrenia including flat affect impoverishment of will attentional problems loss of a theory of mind thought derailment hallucinations and delusions this article models how emotional centers of the brain such as the amygdala interact with sensory and prefrontal cortices notably ventral or orbital prefrontal cortex to generate affective states attend to motivationally salient sensory events and elicit motivated behaviors closing this feedback loop between cognitive and emotional centers is predicted to generate a cognitive emotional resonance that can support conscious awareness when such emotional centers become depressed negative symptoms of schizophrenia emerge in the model such emotional centers are modeled as opponent affective processes such as fear and relief whose response amplitude and sensitivity are calibrated by an arousal level and chemical transmitters that slowly inactivate or habituate in an activity dependent way these opponent processes exhibit an inverted whereby behavior becomes depressed if the arousal level is chosen too large or too small the negative symptoms are owing to the way in which the depressed opponent process interacts with other circuits throughout the brain

Circadian_Rhythms	circadian rhythms identified in caenorhabditis elegans by in vivo long term monitoring of a bioluminescent reporter circadian rhythms are based on endogenous clocks that allow organisms to adjust their physiology and behavior by entrainment to the solar day and in turn to select the optimal times for most biological variables diverse model systems including mice flies fungi plants and bacteria have provided important insights into the mechanisms of circadian rhythmicity however the general principles that govern the circadian clock of caenorhabditis elegans have remained largely elusive here we report robust molecular circadian rhythms in elegans recorded with a bioluminescence assay in vivo and demonstrate the main features of the circadian system of the nematode by constructing a luciferase based reporter coupled to the promoter of the suppressor of activated let num ras sur num gene we show in both population and single nematode assays that elegans expresses approximately num h rhythms that can be entrained by light dark and temperature cycles we provide evidence that these rhythms are temperature compensated and can be re entrained after phase changes of the synchronizing agents in addition we demonstrate that light and temperature sensing requires the photoreceptors and num and the cyclic nucleotide gated channel subunit num our results shed light on elegans circadian biology and demonstrate evolutionarily conserved features in the circadian system of the nematode

Circadian_Rhythms	the colony environment but not direct contact with conspecifics influences the development of circadian rhythms in honey bees honey bee apis mellifera workers emerge from the pupae with no circadian rhythms in behavior or brain clock gene expression but show strong rhythms later in life this postembryonic development of circadian rhythms is reminiscent of that of infants of humans and other primates but contrasts with most insects which typically emerge from the pupae with strong circadian rhythms very little is known about the internal and external factors regulating the ontogeny of circadian rhythms in bees or in other animals we tested the hypothesis that the environment during early life influences the later expression of circadian rhythms in locomotor activity in young honey bees we reared newly emerged bees in various social environments transferred them to individual cages in constant laboratory conditions and monitored their locomotor activity we found that the percentage of rhythmic individuals among bees that experienced the colony environment for their first num h of adult life was similar to that of older sister foragers but their rhythms were weaker sister bees isolated individually in the laboratory for the same period were significantly less likely to show circadian rhythms in locomotor activity bees experiencing the colony environment for only num h or staying for num h with num same age sister bees in the laboratory were similar to bees individually isolated in the laboratory by contrast bees that were caged individually or in groups in single or double mesh enclosures inside a field colony were as likely to exhibit circadian rhythms as their sisters that were freely moving in the same colony these findings suggest that the development of the circadian system in young adult honey bees is faster in the colony than in isolation direct contact with the queen workers or the brood contact pheromones and trophallaxis which are all important means of communication in honey bees cannot account for the influence of the colony environment since they were all withheld from the bees in the double mesh enclosures our results suggest that volatile pheromones the colony microenvironment or both influence the ontogeny of circadian rhythms in honey bees

Circadian_Rhythms	vasoactive intestinal polypeptide mediates circadian rhythms in mammalian olfactory bulb and olfaction accumulating evidence suggests that the olfactory bulbs obs function as an independent circadian system regulating daily rhythms in olfactory performance however the cells and signals in the olfactory system that generate and coordinate these circadian rhythms are unknown using real time imaging of gene expression we found that the isolated olfactory epithelium and but not the piriform cortex express similar sustained circadian rhythms in in vivo expression in the of mice is circadian approximately doubling with a peak around subjective dusk furthermore mice exhibit circadian rhythms in odor detection performance with a peak at approximately subjective dusk we also found that circadian rhythms in gene expression and odor detection performance require vasoactive intestinal polypeptide or its receptor is expressed in a circadian manner in interneurons in the external plexiform and periglomerular layers whereas is expressed in mitral and external tufted cells in the together these results indicate that signaling modulates the output from the to maintain circadian rhythms in the mammalian olfactory system
Circadian_Rhythms	circadian rhythms protein fold switch joins the circadian oscillator to clock output in cyanobacteria organisms are adapted to the relentless cycles of day and night because they evolved timekeeping systems called circadian clocks which regulate biological activities with num hour rhythms the clock of cyanobacteria is driven by a three protein oscillator composed of kaia kaib and kaic which together generate a circadian rhythm of kaic phosphorylation we show that kaib flips between two distinct three dimensional folds and its rare transition to an active state provides a time delay that is required to match the timing of the oscillator to that of earth s rotation once kaib switches folds it binds phosphorylated kaic and captures kaia which initiates a phase transition of the circadian cycle and it regulates components of the clock output pathway which provides the link that joins the timekeeping and signaling functions of the oscillator

Circadian_Rhythms	depression like behaviour in mice is associated with disrupted circadian rhythms in nucleus accumbens and periaqueductal grey an association between circadian rhythms and mood regulation is well established and disturbed circadian clocks are believed to contribute to the development of mood disorders including major depressive disorder the circadian system is coordinated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus the master pacemaker in the hypothalamus that receives light input from the retina and synchronizes circadian oscillators in other brain regions and peripheral tissues lacking the tight neuronal network that couples single cell oscillators in the circadian clocks outside the may be less stable and more susceptible to disturbances for example by clock gene mutations or uncontrollable stress however non circadian clocks have not been studied extensively in rodent models of mood disorders in the present study it was hypothesized that disturbances of local circadian clocks in mood regulating brain areas are associated with depression like behaviour in mice using the learned helplessness procedure depression like behaviour was evoked in mice bearing the circadian reporter and then circadian rhythms of expression were examined in brain slices from these mice using luminometry and bioluminescence imaging it was found that helplessness is associated with absence of circadian rhythms in the nucleus accumbens and the periaqueductal grey two of the most critical brain regions within the reward circuit the current study provides evidence that susceptibility of mice to depression like behaviour is associated with disturbed local circadian clocks in a subset of mood regulating brain areas but the direction of causality remains to be determined

Circadian_Rhythms	hyperuricaemia is associated with renal damage independently of hypertension and intrarenal renin angiotensin system activation as well as their circadian rhythms both hyperuricaemia and activation of the intrarenal renin angiotensin system play an important role in the development of hypertension and renal damage however it has not been clear whether hyperuricaemia is associated with renal damage due to hypertension or intrarenal activation as well as their circadian rhythms we recruited num chronic kidney disease patients who did not receive blockers and antihyperuricaemic drugs and investigated the relationship among serum uric acid sua levels the circadian rhythm of urinary angiotensinogen excretion levels and the levels of albuminuria and proteinuria cr sua levels were significantly associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate egfr num num systolic blood pressure daytime num num and daytime num num and nighttime num num and cr daytime num num and nighttime num num however there were no significant differences between sua levels and in nighttime and excretion levels in both time periods multiple regression analyses for sua levels were performed using age sex egfr and each parameter cr or cr sua levels were not associated with or cr in both time periods sua levels tended to correlate with cr levels in nighttime and were significantly associated with cr in daytime num num and in daytime num num and nighttime num num moreover no significant differences were found between sua levels and night to day ratios of some parameters these data suggest that hyperuricaemia is associated with renal damage independently of hypertension and intrarenal activation as well as their circadian rhythms
Circadian_Rhythms	molecular circadian rhythm shift due to bright light exposure before bedtime is related to subthreshold bipolarity this study examined the link between circadian rhythm changes due to bright light exposure and subthreshold bipolarity molecular circadian rhythms polysomnography and actigraphy data were studied in num young healthy male subjects divided into high and low mood disorder questionnaire score groups during the first num days of the study the subjects were exposed to daily living light num lux for num hours before bedtime saliva and buccal cells were collected num times a day for num consecutive days during the subsequent num days the subjects were exposed to bright light num num lux and saliva and buccal cell samples were collected in the same way molecular circadian rhythms were analyzed using sine regression circadian rhythms of cortisol num num p num num and relative gene expression num num p num num showed a delayed acrophase in both groups after bright light exposure the high score group showed a significant delay in acrophase compared to the low score group only in salivary cortisol num num p num num the high score group showed hypersensitivity in cortisol rhythm shift after bright light exposure suggesting characteristic molecular circadian rhythm changes in the high score group may be related to biological processes downstream from core circadian clock gene expression
Circadian_Rhythms	clinical and psychopathological characteristics of the autoagressive behavior in patients with the first psychotic episode with considering circadian rhythms the high rate of autoagressive action in patients with psychotic symptoms manifested during the beginning of active psychopharmatherapy and they are often the reason for psychiatric help the continuous growth of autoagressive behavior indicates the number of unsolved problems in clinical suicidology the aim of this research was to explore the clinical and psychopathological characteristics of the autoagressive behavior in patients with the first psychotic episode with considering circadian rhythms there was a research in regional clinical psychiatric hospital and num patients were involved in the research with autoagressive behavior during the first psychotic episodes clinical and psychopathological psychodiagnostic and statistical methods were used characteristic clinical manifestations of first psychotic episode is determined by num and num level of suicidal risk is determined by lyuban plotstsa s scale num characteristics of biological rhythms is established by estberg s questionnaire num certain psychiatric symptoms were associated with the level of suicide risk in the first episode of psychosis such as tension hostility mannerisms and posturing excitement suspiciousness somatic concern anxiety depression guilt circadian rhythms include the level of risk occurrence and severity autoagressive behavior such as clearly and dimly expressed evening types of daily activity therefore further research of autoagression during the first psychotic episode with considering the influence of biological rhythms is a given area of current research in psychiatry aimed to improve the prevention treatment and rehabilitation
Circadian_Rhythms	on the role of histamine receptors in the regulation of circadian rhythms several lines of evidence suggest a regulatory role of histamine in circadian rhythms but little is known about signaling pathways that would be involved in such a putative role the aim of this study was to examine whether histamine mediates its effects on the circadian system through hrh or hrh receptors we assessed both diurnal and free running locomotor activity rhythms of hrh and hrh mice we also determined the expression of per per and bmal genes in the suprachiasmatic nuclei several areas of the cerebral cortex and striatum under symmetric num h light dark cycle at zeitgeber times num and num by using radioactive in situ hybridization we found no differences between hrh and wild type mice in the length amplitude and mesor of diurnal and free running activity rhythms as well as in expression of per per and bmal genes in any of the examined brain structures the amplitude of free running activity rhythm of the hrh mice was significantly flattened whereas the expression of the clock genes in hrh mice was similar to the wild type animals in all of the assessed brain structures therefore the knockout of hrh receptor had no effects on the circadian rhythm of spontaneous locomotion and a knockout of hrh receptor caused a substantial reduction of free running activity rhythm amplitude but none of these knockout models affected the expression patterns of the core clock genes in any of the studied brain structures
Circadian_Rhythms	light entrainment of the murine intraocular pressure circadian rhythm utilizes non local mechanisms intraocular pressure is known to have a strong circadian rhythm yet how light dark cycles entrain this rhythm is unknown the purpose of this study was to assess whether like the retina the mammalian ciliary body and clocks have an intrinsic ability to entrain to light dark cycles iris ciliary body complexes were obtained from period luciferase mice and cultured to measure bioluminescence rhythmicity pairs of the iris ciliary body complex were exposed to antiphasic num num h light dark cycle in vitro after num days of exposure to light dark cycles bioluminescence was recorded to establish their circadian phases in addition pairs of the iris ciliary body complex co cultured with the retinas or corneas of wild type mice were also investigated the circadian changes of free running opn rd rd mice whose behavior was antiphasic to wild type were measured by a rebound tonometry and compared with wild type mice opn opn and opn mrna expression in the iris ciliary body were analyzed using the iris ciliary body complex expressed opn opn and opn mrna however unlike in retina and cornea neither the iris complex nor the co cultured complex was directly entrained by light dark cycle in vitro the diurnal change of opn rd rd mice showed an antiphasic pattern to wild type mice and their rhythms followed the whole animal behavioral rhythm despite expressing mrna for several non visual opsins circadian rhythms of the iris ciliary body complex of mice do not entrain directly to light dark cycles ex vivo unlike retina the iris ciliary body clocks of blind mice remain synchronized to the organismal behavioral rhythm rather than local light dark cycles these results suggest that rhythm entrainment is mediated by a systemic rather than local signal in mice
Circadian_Rhythms	studying circadian rhythms in drosophila melanogaster circadian rhythms have a profound influence on most bodily functions from metabolism to complex behaviors they ensure that all these biological processes are optimized with the time of day they are generated by endogenous molecular oscillators that have a period that closely but not exactly matches day length these molecular clocks are synchronized by environmental cycles such as light intensity and temperature drosophila melanogaster has been a model organism of choice to understand genetically molecularly and at the level of neural circuits how circadian rhythms are generated how they are synchronized by environmental cues and how they drive behavioral cycles such as locomotor rhythms this review will cover a wide range of techniques that have been instrumental to our understanding of drosophila circadian rhythms and that are essential for current and future research
Circadian_Rhythms	circadian rhythms in glucose and lipid metabolism in nocturnal and diurnal mammals most aspects of energy metabolism display clear variations during day and night this daily rhythmicity of metabolic functions including hormone release is governed by a circadian system that consists of the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus and many secondary clocks in the brain and peripheral organs the control peripheral timing via the autonomic and neuroendocrine system as well as via behavioral outputs the sleep wake cycle the feeding fasting rhythm and most hormonal rhythms including that of leptin ghrelin and glucocorticoids usually show an opposite phase relative to the light dark cycle in diurnal and nocturnal species by contrast the clock is most active at the same astronomical times in these two categories of mammals moreover in both species pineal melatonin is secreted only at night in this review we describe the current knowledge on the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism by central and peripheral clock mechanisms most experimental knowledge comes from studies in nocturnal laboratory rodents nevertheless we will also mention some relevant findings in diurnal mammals including humans it will become clear that as a consequence of the tight connections between the circadian clock system and energy metabolism circadian clock impairments e g mutations or knock out of clock genes and circadian clock misalignments such as during shift work and chronic jet lag have an adverse effect on energy metabolism that may trigger or enhancing obese and diabetic symptoms
Circadian_Rhythms	new perspective for parkinson s disease circadian rhythm circadian rhythm is manifested by the behavioral and physiological changes from day to night which is controlled by the pacemaker and its regulator the former is located at the suprachiasmatic nuclei in the anterior hypothalamus while the latter is composed of clock genes present in all tissues circadian desynchronization influences normal patterns of day night rhythms such as sleep and alertness cycles rest and activity cycles parkinson s disease exhibits diurnal fluctuations circadian dysfunction has been observed in patients and animal models which may result in negative consequences to the homeostasis and even exacerbate the disease progression therefore circadian therapies including light stimulation physical activity dietary and social schedules may be helpful for patients however the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the circadian dysfunction in remain elusive further research on circadian patterns is needed this article summarizes the existing research on the circadian rhythms in focusing on the clinical symptom variations molecular changes as well as the available treatment options
Circadian_Rhythms	circadian rhythms time restricted feeding and healthy aging circadian rhythms optimize physiology and health by temporally coordinating cellular function tissue function and behavior these endogenous rhythms dampen with age and thus compromise temporal coordination feeding fasting patterns are an external cue that profoundly influence the robustness of daily biological rhythms erratic eating patterns can disrupt the temporal coordination of metabolism and physiology leading to chronic diseases that are also characteristic of aging however sustaining a robust feeding fasting cycle even without altering nutrition quality or quantity can prevent or reverse these chronic diseases in experimental models in humans epidemiological studies have shown erratic eating patterns increase the risk of disease whereas sustained feeding fasting cycles or prolonged overnight fasting is correlated with protection from breast cancer therefore optimizing the timing of external cues with defined eating patterns can sustain a robust circadian clock which may prevent disease and improve prognosis
Circadian_Rhythms	the physiological significance of the circadian dynamics of the axis interplay between circadian rhythms allostasis and stress resilience circadian time keeping mechanisms preserve homeostasis by synchronizing internal physiology with predictable variations in the environment and temporally organize the activation of physiological signaling mechanisms to promote survival and optimize the allocation of energetic resources in this paper we highlight the importance of the robust circadian dynamics of allostatic mediators with a focus on the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis for the optimal regulation of host physiology and in enabling organisms to adequately respond and adapt to physiological stressors we review studies showing how the chronic disruption of circadian rhythms can result in the accumulation of allostatic load which impacts the appropriate functioning of physiological systems and diminishes the resilience of internal systems to adequately respond to subsequent stressors careful consideration of circadian rhythm dynamics leads to a more comprehensive characterization of individual variability in allostatic load and stress resilience finally we suggest that the restoration of circadian rhythms after pathological disruption can enable the re engagement of allostatic mechanisms and re establish stress resilience
Circadian_Rhythms	an individual num h shift of the light dark cycle alters the pancreatic and duodenal circadian rhythm and digestive function in mammals behavioral and physiological rhythms are controlled by circadian clocks which are entrained by environmental light and food signals however how the environmental cues affect digestive tract s circadian clock remains poorly understood therefore in order to elucidate the effect of light cue on the resetting of the peripheral clocks we investigated the expressions of clock genes bmal cry rev erbalpha per and per and digestive function genes cck cck r sct sctr and ctrb in the pancreas and duodenum of rats after the light dark cycle reversal for num days we found that both the clock genes and digestive function genes exhibited a clear and similar daily rhythmicity in the pancreas and duodenum of rats after reversal of the cycle for num days the expressions of clock genes in pancreas including bmal cry and rev erbalpha were affected whereas the expression of per gene failed to fit the cosine wave however in the duodenum the shifted genes were bmal rev erbalpha and per in parallel the per gene expression also lost its circadian rhythm by reversal of the cycle therefore the acrophases of the clock genes were shifted in a tissue and gene specific manner furthermore the profiles of the digestive function genes including sctr and ctrb were also affected by changes in cycle these observations suggest that the mechanisms underlying the pancreatic and duodenal clocks are distinct and there may be a potential linkage between the circadian clock system and the digestive system

Circadian_Rhythms	involvement of the clock gene period in the circadian rhythm of the silkmoth bombyx mori in lepidoptera the roles of period per and the negative feedback involving this gene in circadian rhythm are controversial in the present study we established a per knockout strain using in bombyx mori and compared eclosion and hatching rhythms between the per knockout and wild type strains to examine whether per is actually involved in these rhythms the generated per knockout allele was considered null because it encoded an extensively truncated form of num aa due to a num bp deletion in exon num in contrast to num aa in the wild type protein in this per knockout strain circadian rhythms in eclosion and hatching were disrupted under cycles however a steep peak existed at num h after lights on in both eclosion and hatching and was considered to be produced by a masking effect a direct response to light in the per knockout strain temporal expression changes of per and timeless tim were also lost the expression levels of tim were continuously high probably due to the loss of negative feedback by per and tim in contrast the expression levels of per were much lower in the per knockout strain than in the wild type at every time point from these results we concluded that per is indispensable for circadian rhythms and we suggest that the negative feedback loop of the circadian rhythm involving per functions for the production of behavioral rhythms in mori

Circadian_Rhythms	vasculature on the clock circadian rhythm and vascular dysfunction the master mammalian circadian clock i e central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus orchestrates the synchronization of the daily behavioural and physiological rhythms to better adapt the organism to the external environment in an anticipatory manner this central clock is entrained by a variety of signals the best established being light and food however circadian cycles are not simply the consequences of these two cues but are generated by endogenous circadian clocks indeed clock machinery is found in mainly all tissues and cell types including cells of the vascular system such as endothelial cells fibroblasts smooth muscle cells and stem cells this machinery physiologically contributes to modulate the daily vascular function and its disturbance therefore plays a major role in the pathophysiology of vascular dysfunction therapies targeting the circadian rhythm may therefore be of benefit against vascular disease
Circadian_Rhythms	circadian rhythms in mitochondrial respiration many physiological processes are regulated with a num h periodicity to anticipate the environmental changes of daytime to nighttime and vice versa these num h regulations commonly termed circadian rhythms among others control the sleep wake cycle locomotor activity and preparation for food availability during the active phase daytime for humans and nighttime for nocturnal animals disturbing circadian rhythms at the organ or whole body level by social jetlag or shift work increases the risk to develop chronic metabolic diseases such as type num diabetes mellitus the molecular basis of this risk is a topic of increasing interest mitochondria are essential organelles that produce the majority of energy in eukaryotes by converting lipids and carbohydrates into through oxidative phosphorylation to adapt to the ever changing environment mitochondria are highly dynamic in form and function and a loss of this flexibility is linked to metabolic diseases interestingly recent studies have indicated that changes in mitochondrial morphology i e fusion and fission as well as generation of new mitochondria are dependent on a viable circadian clock in addition fission and fusion processes display diurnal changes that are aligned to the light darkness cycle besides morphological changes mitochondrial respiration also displays diurnal changes disturbing the molecular clock in animal models leads to abrogated mitochondrial rhythmicity and altered respiration moreover mitochondrial dependent production of reactive oxygen species which plays a role in cellular signaling has also been linked to the circadian clock in this review we will summarize recent advances in the study of circadian rhythms of mitochondria and how this is linked to the molecular circadian clock

Circadian_Rhythms	depression caused by long term stress regulates premature aging and is possibly associated with disruption of circadian rhythms in mice depression has been associated with circadian disruption and premature aging nevertheless mechanisms underlying the link between long term stress with premature aging and possible associations with circadian rhythms remain elusive here mice were exposed to chronic mild stress for weeks to induce depression like symptoms which were confirmed with the open field test tail suspension test and sucrose preference test then the circadian rhythms of age related indexes were compared between control and stressed mice long term stress resulted in decreased body weight gain and locomotor activities accompanied by losses of subcutaneous backside fat decreased amounts of thigh muscle fibers and shortened telomere length in hepatocytes stressed mice showed increased oxidative damage causing impaired mitochondrial function and inflammatory responses which may be mediated by the sirtuin num superoxide dismutase num signaling pathway these changes may be associated with partial disruption of circadian rhythms or shifting phase values of some age related indicators induced by long term stress these findings suggest that long term exposure to stress may increase the risk of depression and regulate age related phenotypes through associations with circadian rhythms
Circadian_Rhythms	circadian rhythms in visual responsiveness in the behaviorally arrhythmic drosophila clock mutant clk jrk an organism s biological day is characterized by a pattern of anticipatory physiological and behavioral changes that are governed by circadian clocks to align with the num h cycling environment here we used flash electroretinograms ergs and steady state visually evoked potentials ssveps to examine how visual responsiveness in wild type drosophila melanogaster and the circadian clock mutant clk jrk varies over circadian time we show that the parameters of wild type flies vary over the circadian day with a higher luminance response during the subjective night the response that assesses contrast sensitivity also showed a time of day dependence including num prominent peaks within a num h period and a maximal response at the end of the subjective day indicating a tradeoff between luminance and contrast sensitivity moreover the behaviorally arrhythmic clk jrk mutants maintained a circadian profile in both luminance and contrast sensitivity but unlike the wild types which show bimodal profiles in their visual response clk jrk flies show a weakening of the bimodal character with visual responsiveness tending to peak once a day we conclude that the clk jrk mutation mainly affects num of num functionally coupled oscillators and that the visual system is partially separated from the locomotor circadian circuits that drive bouts of morning and evening activity as light exposure is a major mechanism for entrainment our work suggests that a detailed temporal analysis of electrophysiological responses is warranted to better identify the time window at which circadian rhythms are most receptive to light induced phase shifting

Circadian_Rhythms	synchronizing effects of melatonin on diurnal and circadian rhythms in mammals the rhythmic secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland is driven by the circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus the robust nightly peak of melatonin secretion is an output signal of the circadian clock and is supposed to deliver the circadian message to the whole of the organism since the circadian system regulates many behavioral and physiological processes its disruption by external shift work jet lag or internal desynchronization blindness aging causes many different health problems externally applied melatonin is used in humans as a chronobiotic drug to treat desynchronization and circadian disorders and the success of these treatments does at first glance underline the supposed pivotal role of melatonin in the synchronization of the circadian system on the other hand pinealectomy in experimental animals and humans does not abolish their rhythms of rest and activity furthermore mice with deficient melatoninergic systems neither display overt defects in their rhythmic behavior nor do they show obvious signs of disease susceptibility let alone premature mortality during the last years our laboratory has investigated several mouse stains with intact or compromised internal melatonin signaling systems in order to better understand the physiological role of the melatoninergic system these and other investigations which will be reviewed in the present contribution confirm the synchronizing effect of endogenous melatonin and the melatoninergic system however these effects are subtle thus melatonin does not appear as the master of internal synchronization but as one component in a cocktail of synchronizing agents
Circadian_Rhythms	impairment of circadian rhythms in peripheral clocks by constant light is partially reversed by scheduled feeding or exercise in mammals circadian rhythms in peripheral organs are impaired when animals are maintained in abnormal environmental light dark cycles such as constant light this conclusion is based on averaged data from groups of experimental animals sacrificed at each time point to investigate the effect of housing on the peripheral clocks of individual mice an in vivo imaging system was used to observe the circadian bioluminescence rhythm in peripheral tissues of the liver kidney and submandibular salivary gland in knock in mice using this technique we demonstrated that the majority of individual peripheral tissues still had rhythmic oscillations of their circadian clocks in conditions however housing caused decreased amplitudes and a broad distribution of peak phases in oscillations irrespective of the state of the animals behavioral rhythmicity because both scheduled feeding and scheduled exercise are effective recovery stimuli for circadian clock deficits we examined whether scheduled feeding or scheduled exercise could reverse this impairment the results showed that scheduled feeding or exercise could not restore the amplitude of peripheral clocks in on the other hand the induced broad phase distribution was reversed and peak phases were entrained to a specific time point by scheduled feeding but only slightly by scheduled exercise the present results demonstrate that housing impairs peripheral circadian clock oscillations by altering both amplitude and phase in individual mice the broad distribution of clock phases was clearly reversed by scheduled feeding suggesting the importance of scheduled feeding as an entraining stimulus for impaired peripheral clocks

Loss	children exposed to a natural disaster psychological consequences eight years after num tsunami there is a need for studies that follow up children and adolescents for many years post disaster since earlier studies have shown that exposure during natural disasters constitutes a risk factor for poor psychological health the main aim was to examine whether there was an association between severity of exposures during a natural disaster experienced in childhood or adolescence and posttraumatic stress symptoms psychological distress self rated health diagnosis of depression anxiety or worry thoughts about or attempted suicide physical symptoms or daily functioning eight years later in young adulthood second aim was to compare psychological distress and self rated health of exposed young adults with a matched population based sample young adults who experienced the num tsunami as children between num and num years of age responded to a questionnaire eight years post disaster the results were compared to a matched population sample the results showed that the likelihood for negative psychological outcomes was higher for those who had been exposed to several types of exposures during this natural disaster the negative psychological impact on children and adolescents can still be present eight years post disaster and seems to have association with the type of exposure loss physical presence and subjective experience it is important for clinicians who meet young adults seeking help to be conscious about the impact as long as eight years post disaster and to be aware of possible clinical implications associated with severity of exposures
Loss	development assistance for health should policy makers worry about its macroeconomic impact many low income countries need to substantially increase expenditure to meet universal coverage goals for essential health services but because they have very low incomes most will be unable to raise adequate funds exclusively from domestic sources in the short to medium term increased aid for health will be required however there has long been a concern that the rapid arrival of large amounts of foreign exchange in a country could lead to an increase in inflation and loss of international competitiveness with an adverse impact on exports and economic growth an economic phenomenon termed dutch disease we review cross country and country level empirical studies and propose a simple framework to gauge the extent of macroeconomic risks of the num low income countries that are increasing aid financed health spending num have high macroeconomic risks that may constrain the sustained expansion of spending these conditions also apply in one quarter of the num countries not presently increasing spending health authorities should be aware of the multiple risk factors at play including factors that are health sector specific and others that generally are not they should also realize that there are effective means for mitigating the risk of dutch disease associated with increasing development assistance for health international partners also have an important role to play since more sustainable and predictable flows of donor funding will allow more productivity enhancing investment in physical and human capital which will also contribute to ensuring there are few harmful macroeconomic effects of increases in aid

Loss	it is time to remove the benign from the essential tremor label in recent years studies of essential tremor have demonstrated that the disease is associated with functionally relevant cognitive abnormalities a mood disturbance and other psychiatric co morbidities a functionally significant gait disorder hearing deficits and a variety of types of tremor the tremor has been shown to be progressive in nature and quite disabling for a large number of sufferers also recent clinical epidemiological studies have linked prevalent to other neurodegenerative diseases and at least one study has demonstrated an increased risk of mortality in an cohort while many of these studies are derived from clinic based samples population based studies have also substantiated these findings suggesting that even in the general population the disease is associated with disability and with co morbidity based on these available studies it would seem inaccurate to append the word benign to not unlike the word essential itself the word benign is an antiquated and outdated term that reflects an era where little was understood about historically the general doctors who frequently encountered the disorder would educate patients that it was a benign non progressive condition not associated with any co morbidity or risk of long term worry this notion conceived by prior generations of physicians is now known to be inaccurate it is therefore our recommendation that the medical community open the dialog to consider formally discontinuing this nosology benign essential tremor and to adopt the use of the term essential tremor use of the word benign is a mischaracterization of the disease course and could be prove misleading especially in the evolving doctor patient relationship in those cases with currently mild tremor the nosology mild essential tremor would be a more accurate reflection of disease

Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	episodic foresight and anxiety proximate and ultimate perspectives in this paper we examine the relationship between episodic foresight and anxiety from an evolutionary perspective proposing that together they confer an advantage for modifying present moment decision making and behaviour in the light of potential future threats to fitness we review the body of literature on the role of episodic foresight in anxiety from both proximate and ultimate perspectives we propose that anxious feelings associated with episodic simulation of possible threat related future events serve to imbue these simulations with motivational currency episodic and semantic details of a future threat may be insufficient for motivating its avoidance but anxiety associated with a simulation can provoke adaptive threat management as such we detail how anxiety triggered by a self generated threat related future simulation prepares the individual to manage that threat in terms of its likelihood and or consequences over greater temporal distances than observed in other animals we then outline how anxiety subtypes may represent specific mechanisms for predicting and managing particular classes of fitness threats this approach offers an inroad for understanding the nature of characteristic future thinking patterns in anxiety disorders and serves to illustrate the adaptive function of the mechanism from which clinical anxiety deviates
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	the effects of safety behavior directed towards a safety cue on perceptions of threat safety behavior involves precautions to prevent or minimize a feared outcome and is involved in the maintenance of anxiety disorders earlier research has shown that safety behavior prevents the extinction of conditioned fear and maintains threat expectations this study tested whether safety behavior directed towards an objectively safe stimulus increases the perceived threat of that stimulus when it is subsequently experienced in the absence of the safety measure in a conditioning task participants first learned that one danger cue was followed by shock and two safety cues were not then they learned to apply safety behavior during trials which prevented the shock next the experimental group and not the control group was given the opportunity to display safety behavior to trials which had never been coupled with the shock in a subsequent test phase and were presented without the opportunity for participants to engage in safety behavior results showed that safety behavior increased shock expectancy to in the test phase and maintained a preexisting shock expectancy in the experimental group but not in the control group this is the first study to show that safety behavior can maintain threat appraisal to stimuli that only ever acquired threat indirectly this may be a possible mechanism for the origin of biased threat beliefs superstitious behaviors and irrational fears it is also practically relevant safety behavior reduces actual danger but in relatively safe situations its potential costs may outweigh the benefits

Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	anxiety potentiated amygdala medial frontal coupling and attentional control anxiety disorders can be treated both pharmacologically and psychologically but many individuals either fail to respond to treatment or relapse improving outcomes is difficult in part because we have incomplete understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying current treatments in a sequence of studies we have identified affective bias related amygdala medial cortical coupling as a candidate substrate underlying adaptive anxiety that is anxiety elicited by threat of shock in healthy individuals and shown that it is also chronically engaged in maladaptive anxiety disorders we have provided evidence that this circuit can be modulated pharmacologically but whether this mechanism can be shifted by simple psychological instruction is unknown in this functional magnetic resonance imaging study we extend a previously used translational anxiety induction threat of shock in healthy subjects num and cognitive task to include an element of instructed attentional control replicating our previous findings we show that induced anxiety engages affective bias related amygdala dorsal medial frontal coupling during the processing of emotional faces by contrast instructing subjects to attend to neutral shapes and ignore faces disengages this circuitry and increases putative attentional control related coupling between the amygdala and a more rostral prefrontal region these neural coupling changes are accompanied by corresponding modulation of behavioural performance taken together these findings serve to further highlight the potential role of amygdala medial frontal coupling in the pathogenesis of anxiety and highlight a mechanism by which it can be modulated via psychological instructions this in turn generates hypotheses for future work exploring the mechanisms underlying psychological therapeutic interventions for anxiety
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	cognitive bias modification for attention and interpretation reduces trait and state anxiety in anxious patients referred to an out patient service results from a pilot study it is well established that anxious individuals show biases in information processing such that they attend preferentially to threatening stimuli and interpret emotional ambiguity in a threatening way it has also been established that these biases in attention and interpretation can causally influence anxiety recent advances in experimental work have involved the development of a paradigm known as cognitive bias modification a constellation of procedures which directly modify bias using computerised tasks excitingly these procedures have been shown to reduce bias in attention to threat and to promote a positive interpretive bias in anxious populations furthermore these modifications are associated with reductions in anxiety we believe that these techniques have the potential to create a real clinical impact for people with anxiety initial studies involved volunteer participants who reached criteria for clinical diagnoses to be made but emerging evidence suggests that patients referred for therapy also benefit for the purposes of experimentation researchers have normally looked at one procedure at a time in order to try to maximise the potential clinical impact we wished to investigate whether the combination of the procedures would be more effective than either alone we also wished to investigate whether the procedures could be carried out in routine clinical settings with patients referred to an out patient psychological treatment service we therefore carried out a pilot study using a combined approach of and with a sample of num anxious patients referred to an out patient psychology service for cognitive therapy the results showed successful reductions in threat related attentional and interpretive bias as well as reductions in trait and state anxiety participant reports describe the procedures as acceptable with the attentional task experienced as boring but the interpretive one experienced as helpful while recognising the methodological problems of the pilot study we believe that these results give indications that the techniques could provide an effective intervention for anxiety and that further study is well justified
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	future oriented thought patterns associated with anxiety and depression in later life the intriguing prospects of prospection anxiety and mood disorders in later life are the focus of an increasing amount of intervention research however basic mechanisms and paradigms explaining etiology and maintenance warrant further exploration research on future oriented thought patterns associated with anxiety and depression in this age group may prove useful as these disorders are both characterized by a tendency to generate and fixate on threat related future scenarios that may or may not materialize additionally depression is associated with a reduced expectancy of positive future events in this paper we review the literature relevant to future thinking in anxiety and depression in older adults we focus on the mental construction and anticipation of negative future events and their underlying neurocognitive mechanisms we then consider clinical and research implications of anxious and depressive future oriented thought patterns for older adults we believe that more research investigating future oriented thought patterns associated with emotional disorders in later life could improve conceptualization measurement and perhaps potential treatments for late life anxiety and depression
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	when threat is near get out of here dynamics of defensive behavior during freezing and active avoidance when detecting a threat humans and other animals engage in defensive behaviors and supporting physiological adjustments that vary with threat imminence and potential response options in the present study we shed light on the dynamics of defensive behaviors and associated physiological adjustments in humans using multiple psychophysiological and brain measures when participants were exposed to a dynamically approaching uncontrollable threat attentive freezing was augmented as indicated by an increase in skin conductance fear bradycardia and potentiation of the startle reflex in contrast when participants had the opportunity to actively avoid the approaching threat attention switched to response preparation as indicated by an inhibition of the startle magnitude and by a sharp drop of the probe elicited component of the evoked brain potentials these new findings on the dynamics of defensive behaviors form an important intersection between animal and human research and have important implications for understanding fear and anxiety related disorders
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	do controlling maternal behaviours increase state anxiety in children s responses to a social threat pilot study past research has demonstrated a link between controlling parenting and child anxiety however the causal nature of this association has not yet been established since most previous studies have utilised cross sectional designs the aim of the current study was to implement an experimental design to examine the impact of maternal control on children s state anxiety when faced with a social threat mothers of num children aged num num years were randomly allocated to conditions in which they were either required to be overly controlling or minimally controlling during preparation of a practice speech by their child in a subsequent speech that children were required to prepare alone children whose mothers had previously been overly controlling during the practice showed greater anxiety than did children whose mothers had previously been minimally controlling this pilot study describes a novel paradigm that has the potential to address issues related to the causal role of specific parenting behaviours in the experience of negative emotions

Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	specific trait and state anxiety s roles in emergence and maintenance of attentional biases associated with anxiety inventories and investigation tracks during these two last decades much research has shown that anxiety can be characterised by an attentional bias favouring threat stimuli processing this bias plays a central role in the development and maintenance of pathological states associated with anxiety the first part of this article concerns numerous variables that elucidate parts of the appearance and maintenance conditions of attentional bias associated with anxiety thus clinical versus non clinical states of individuals play an important role in attentional behaviour of anxiety at an early stage of information processing which involves mainly automatic processes the attentional bias appears whatever the status of anxious individuals at a later stage which involves controlled processes non clinical anxious subjects would be able to use defensive strategies which allow them to counterbalance the bias that appeared before while clinical anxious subjects would not be able to ignore this threat because of the major rooting of their anxiety vigilance attentional bias would be shown in clinical individuals throughout a continuum of information processing in addition a near unanimous observation highlights the importance of the material specificity in obtaining attentional bias however this observation appears less obvious for the subliminal condition in which anxious individuals can perfect a surface analysis of the material identifying the emotional valence of a word and not its specificity literature findings on anxiety impact in order to release more clarity and in an attempt to explain empirical results that sometimes remain contradictory the second part of this article is particularly focused on another research track rarely used but very promising it concerns differentiating the specific roles of anxiety state and anxiety trait in the attentional patterns the anxiety trait is defined as an acquired behavioural disposition which predisposes an individual to perceive a whole of circumstances objectively and not as dangerous or threatening on the other hand anxiety state reflects variable component and is defined as an emotive state characterized by subjective and conscious feelings of apprehension and tension associated with an activation of the autonomous nervous system for a long time researchers have mainly focused on this first variable while occulting the second however various theoretical models underline that the anxiety trait variable alone is certainly a condition necessary but insufficient in the appearance and maintenance of attentional bias thus some empirical research highlighting the potential role of the anxiety state was born although they have for the moment a limited range due to the heterogeneity of their results these studies open a new route of considerable research thus on the preattentive level the dominant role of the interaction between anxiety state and anxiety trait in the release of bias was highlighted in a near consensual way it is not the same at a later stage of information processing which is a stage where two tracks of results are confronted a part of research suggests that maintenance of bias is due to as at the preattentive level an interactive effect of state and trait anxieties whereas other research shows a central role of anxiety state in maintenance of attentional bias recent studies using different paradigms confirm the idea of a central role of anxiety state further research separating the specific roles of state and trait anxiety will be necessary to decide clearly various explanatory tracks were suggested to try to clear up these data thus it s possible that the time course of the stressor may be an important variable in addition the review highlights that state anxiety averages are too often far from the norms established by spielberger et al in short if the state anxiety level is not sufficiently high in a number of searches it then appears difficult to highlight the attentional biases which are associated with it among them the resort to a methodology combining physiological measurements salivary index ocular movements recording and cognitive measurements questionnaires dot probe paradigm stroop task seems to warrant a better understanding of attentional processes

Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	neuromarker of clinical outcome in attention bias modification therapy for social anxiety disorder attention bias modification therapy aims to modify threat related attention patterns via computerized tasks despite showing medium clinical effect sizes for anxiety disorders underlying neural cognitive mechanisms of change remain unclear we used visual mismatch negativity vmmn an event related potential sensitive to violations of learned statistical contingencies to assess therapy related contingency extraction processes in healthy participants and in patients with social anxiety disorder we then assessed whether vmmn amplitude predicts treatment outcome modified version of the dot probe task was used to elicit vmmn in which num of trials were standard and num were deviant in study num num healthy adults were randomly assigned to one of two conditions one in which threat congruent targets were deviant trials and threat incongruent targets were standard trials and another in which the contingency was reversed electroencephalography was continuously measured and vmmn analyzed in study num num patients with underwent six sessions of therapy we tested whether rule extraction in the task indicated by vmmn amplitude predicts treatment outcome vmmn clearly emerged over prespecified scalp locations indicating contingency extraction during study num vmmn amplitude predicted clinical improvement after therapy uniquely accounting for num and num num of the variance in clinician rated and self reported posttreatment symptoms respectively vmmn emerges as a neural marker for contingency learning in suggesting a significant role for contingency extraction processes in the clinical efficacy of this therapy
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	functional connectivity under anticipation of shock correlates of trait anxious affect versus induced anxiety sustained anxiety about potential future negative events is an important feature of anxiety disorders in this study we used a novel anticipation of shock paradigm to investigate individual differences in functional connectivity during prolonged threat of shock we examined the correlates of between participant differences in trait anxious affect and induced anxiety where the latter reflects changes in self reported anxiety resulting from the shock manipulation dissociable effects of trait anxious affect and induced anxiety were observed participants with high scores on a latent dimension of anxious affect showed less increase in ventromedial pfc amygdala connectivity between periods of safety and shock anticipation meanwhile lower levels of induced anxiety were linked to greater augmentation of dorsolateral pfc anterior insula connectivity during shock anticipation these findings suggest that ventromedial pfc amygdala and dorsolateral pfc insula networks might both contribute to regulation of sustained fear responses with their recruitment varying independently across participants the former might reflect an evolutionarily old mechanism for reducing fear or anxiety whereas the latter might reflect a complementary mechanism by which cognitive control can be implemented to diminish fear responses generated due to anticipation of aversive stimuli or events these two circuits might provide complementary alternate targets for exploration in future pharmacological and cognitive intervention studies
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	threat detection behavioral practices in animals and humans in contrast to a perceptible threat that releases freezing fleeing and fighting abstract potential threat elicits anxiety and vigilance the prevalent view is that the larger the animal groups the lower the individual vigilance vigilance is a reflection of anxiety and here we show that anxiety is contagious in grouped social animals in humans anxiety frequently results in rituals that confer a sense of controllability and thereby a means to cope with anxiety accordingly in mental disorders with sustained anxiety rituals predominate the behavior and consequently reduce functionality finally the adaptive value of precautionary behavior including rituals lies in providing individuals with the opportunity to practice defensive means safely and thus to prepare for the eventuality of real danger accordingly the prevalence of anxiety in human and animal behavior accords with the better safe than sorry principle
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	stimulation of the nigrotectal pathway at the level of the superior colliculus reduces threat recognition and causes a shift from avoidance to approach behavior defensive behavioral responses are essential for survival in threating situations the superior colliculus has been implicated in the generation of defensive behaviors elicited by visual tactile and auditory stimuli furthermore substantia nigra pars reticulata snr neurons are known to exert a modulatory effect on midbrain tectum neural substrates however the functional role of this nigrotectal pathway in threating situations is still poorly understood using optogenetics in freely behaving mice we activated snr projections at the level of the and assessed consequences on behavioral performance in an open field test and the beetle mania task the latter confronts a mouse with an erratic moving robo beetle and allows to measure active and passive defensive responses upon frequent encounter of the threatening object channelrhodopsin num chr mediated activation of the inhibitory nigrotectal pathway did not affect anxiety like and exploratory behavior in the but increased the number of contacts between robo beetle and test mouse in the depending on the size of the arena active avoidance responses were reduced whereas tolerance and close following of the robo beetle were significantly increased we conclude from the data that the nigrotectal pathway plays holds the potential to modulate innate fear by attenuating threat recognition and causing a shift from defensive to approach behavior
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	efficacy of attention bias training for child anxiety disorders randomized controlled trial growing evidence base supports attention bias modification as a novel intervention for anxiety however research has been largely conducted with adults and analogue samples leaving the impact of for child anxiety be fully elucidated thus we conducted a double blind randomized controlled trial testing efficacy versus an attention control condition in num children diagnosed with anxiety disorder youth were assigned to num weeks of where attention was trained away from threat or a sham in which no bias training occurred findings indicate that significantly more youth in the versus group were considered treatment responders post training the versus group also demonstrated a greater decrease in anxiety severity with this difference being marginally significant findings lend support for the potential of in reducing youth anxiety further work regarding mechanisms of action is warranted to advance research
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	phasic and sustained brain responses in the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis during threat anticipation several lines of evidence suggest that the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis are differentially involved in phasic and sustained fear even though results from neuroimaging studies support this distinction a specific effect of a temporal dissociation with phasic responses to onset versus sustained responses during prolonged states of threat anticipation has not been shown yet to explore this issue we investigated brain activation during anticipation of threat in num healthy participants by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging participants were presented different visual cues indicated the temporally unpredictable occurrence of a subsequent aversive or neutral stimulus during the onset of aversive versus neutral anticipatory cues results showed a differential phasic activation of amygdala anterior cingulate cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in contrast activation in the and other brain regions including insula dorsolateral cuneus posterior cingulate cortex and periaqueductal grey was characterized by a sustained response during the threat versus neutral anticipation period analyses of functional connectivity showed phasic amygdala response as positively associated with activation mainly in sensory cortex areas whereas sustained activation was negatively associated with activation in visual cortex and positively correlated with activation in the insula and thalamus these findings suggest that the amygdala is responsive to the onset of cues signaling the unpredictable occurrence of a potential threat while the in concert with other areas is involved in sustained anxiety furthermore the amygdala and are characterized by distinctive connectivity patterns during threat anticipation
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	uncertainty and anticipation in anxiety an integrated neurobiological and psychological perspective uncertainty about a possible future threat disrupts our ability to avoid it or to mitigate its negative impact and thus results in anxiety here we focus the broad literature on the neurobiology of anxiety through the lens of uncertainty we identify five processes that are essential for adaptive anticipatory responses to future threat uncertainty and propose that alterations in the neural instantiation of these processes result in maladaptive responses to uncertainty in pathological anxiety this framework has the potential to advance the classification diagnosis and treatment of clinical anxiety
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	impact of induced anxiety on neural responses to monetary incentives previous research demonstrates that aversive stimuli can interrupt appetitive processing and that brain regions involved with the processing of potential rewards such as the ventral striatum also respond to threatening information potential losses can likewise activate the and thus the full extent to which threat can impact neural responses during incentive processing remains unclear here unpredictable threat of shock was used to induce anxiety while participants performed the monetary incentive delay task during functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri during anticipation anxiety impacted neural responses within the bilateral and distributed regions of the occipital cortex anxiety enhanced activity within the to both gain and loss trials furthermore anxiety enhanced activity to both gain and loss trials within dorsal areas of however anxiety only enhanced activity during gain but not loss trials within ventral areas of these results suggest that during anticipation induced anxiety enhanced activity to incentives generally which might reflect changes in the subjective salience of gains and losses collectively these results suggest that the impact of induced anxiety on responses to monetary incentives depend on the neural region type of incentive and stage of processing

Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	anxiety and attentional bias for threat an event related potential study we investigated the attentional bias for threat in selected high and low trait anxious participants using an event related potential technique modified cue target paradigm was adopted with threatening and nonthreatening pictures as uninformative location cues in high anxious individuals reactions were speeded up and the occipitoparietal amplitude was enhanced when targets appeared at the same location as threatening pictures relative to nonthreatening ones whereas in low anxious individuals the amplitude tended to be enhanced when the targets appeared at the opposite location to threatening pictures these results suggest that the attentional bias caused by peripheral threatening stimuli is able to modulate the visual inputs in early processing stages and this mechanism is markedly influenced by an individual s anxiety level
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	is there room for development in developmental models of information processing biases to threat in children and adolescents clinical and experimental theories assume that processing biases in attention and interpretation are a causal mechanism through which anxiety develops despite growing evidence that these processing biases are present in children and therefore develop long before adulthood these theories ignore the potential role of child development this review attempts to place information processing biases within a theoretical developmental framework we consider whether child development has no impact on information processing biases to threat integral bias model or whether child development influences information processing biases and if so whether it does so by moderating the expression of an existing bias moderation model or by affecting the acquisition of a bias acquisition model we examine the extent to which these models fit with existing theory and research evidence and outline some methodological issues that need to be considered when drawing conclusions about the potential role of child development in the information processing of threat stimuli finally we speculate about the developmental processes that might be important to consider in future research
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	threat related attention bias variability and posttraumatic stress threat monitoring facilitates survival by allowing one to efficiently and accurately detect potential threats traumatic events can disrupt healthy threat monitoring inducing biased and unstable threat related attention deployment recent research suggests that greater attention bias variability that is attention fluctuations alternating toward and away from threat occurs in participants with relative to healthy comparison subjects who were either exposed or not exposed to traumatic events the current study extends findings on attention bias variability in previous measurement of attention bias variability was refined by employing a moving average technique analyses were conducted across seven independent data sets in each data on attention bias variability were collected by using variants of the dot probe task trauma related and anxiety symptoms were evaluated across samples by using structured psychiatric interviews and widely used self report questionnaires as specified for each sample analyses revealed consistent evidence of greater attention bias variability in patients with following various types of traumatic events than in healthy participants participants with social anxiety disorder and participants with acute stress disorder moreover threat related and not positive attention bias variability was correlated with severity these findings carry possibilities for using attention bias variability as a specific cognitive marker of and for tailoring protocols for attention bias modification for this disorder

Sleep_Wakefulness	excitation of gabaergic neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis triggers immediate transition from non rapid eye movement sleep to wakefulness in mice emotionally salient situations usually trigger arousal along with autonomic and neuroendocrine reactions to determine whether the extended amygdala plays a role in sleep wakefulness regulation we examined the effects of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic excitation of gabaergic neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis neurons acute optogenetic excitation of these cells during nonrapid eye movement sleep resulted in an immediate state transition to wakefulness whereas stimulation during sleep showed no effect on sleep wakefulness states in male mice an anterograde tracing study suggested neurons send axonal projections to several brain regions implicated in arousal including the preoptic area lateral hypothalamus periaqueductal gray deep mesencephalic nucleus and parabrachial nucleus dual orexin receptor antagonist num did not affect the optogenetic transition from sleep to wakefulness chemogenetic excitation of neurons evoked a sustained wakefulness state but this arousal effect was markedly attenuated by num these observations suggest that neurons play an important role in transition from sleep to wakefulness without the function of orexin neurons but prolonged excitation of these cells mobilizes the orexin system to sustain wakefulness we examined the role of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis in the regulation of wakefulness optogenetic excitation of gabaergic neurons in the neurons during nonrapid eye movement sleep in mice resulted in immediate transition to a wakefulness state without function of orexins prolonged excitation of neurons by a chemogenetic method evoked a longer lasting sustained wakefulness state which was abolished by preadministration of a dual orexin receptor antagonist num this study revealed a role of the gabaergic system in sleep wakefulness control especially in shifting animals behavioral states from sleep to wakefulness and provides an important insight into the pathophysiology of insomnia and the role of orexin in arousal regulation
Sleep_Wakefulness	descriptive analysis of sleep and wakefulness states during maternal behaviors in postpartum rats mother rats spend most of their time nursing their litter during the early stages of the postpartum period only occasionally leaving the nest the suckling stimulus from the pups elicits the adoption of nursing postures during which milk ejection occurs an event associated with the occurrence of non sleep in the rat despite this evidence the characteristics of sleep during different nursing postures along the postpartum period remain unknown the present study aims to describe the sleep pattern of mother rats while nursing hovering over their pups and when being away from the pups for this purpose lactating females were implanted with electrodes for chronic polysomnographic recording simultaneous recordings of sleep wakefulness cycle and maternal behaviors were performed in both the light and dark phases of the first and second postpartum weeks results indicate that while mothers were most of the time awake when hovering over pups and when staying away from pups they mainly remained in sleep when adopting low kyphosis posture the most common nursing posture the sleep wake pattern during most maternal behaviors was quite stable between the light and dark phases of the first and second postpartum weeks in addition the sleep fragmentation was higher during the nursing bouts compared to that observed when mother rats slept without the pups but sleep depth did not differ between these behaviors our results provide an original description of how mother rats synchronize their own sleep wakefulness cycle with the maternal care of the pups during the postpartum period
Sleep_Wakefulness	changes in sleep wakefulness in the medial preoptic area lesioned rats role of thermal preference changes in sleep wakefulness were studied in adult male wistar rats along with body temperature b locomotor activity and thermal preference after the lesion of the medial preoptic area mpoa with methyl aspartic acid the sleep was decreased after the lesion of the mpoa but there was recovery when the rats were given freedom to stay in an ambient temperature amb which they preferred when given a choice between three amb num num and num degrees the rats preferred num degrees before the mpoa lesion and num degrees during the initial days after the lesion there was a shift in the thermal preference to num degrees on the fourth week after the lesion which coincided with the considerable recovery of sleep the preference for higher amb probably helped to improve sleep as amb of num degrees is known to promote sleep when the lesioned rats were not given the freedom to select the amb there was no recovery in sleep the mpoa seems to be essential for increasing the durations of slow wave sleep episodes especially the light as they remained shorter than the pre lesion value even when the rats were given freedom to stay in a preferred amb the homeostatic recovery of sleep especially the night time sleep resulted in the disruption of circadian sleep rhythm but the b and thermal preference maintained their diurnal variation b and were elevated after the mpoa lesion and they remained so till the end of the study

Sleep_Wakefulness	medial preoptic area affects sleep wakefulness independent of associated body temperature change in free moving rats sleep wakefulness and body temperature may modulate each other though both the functions are influenced by the medial preoptic area the mechanism of action was not clear this study was aimed at finding out whether the tonic influence of the medial preoptic area on sleep wakefulness was independent of or secondary to simultaneous change in body temperature the effects of inactivation of the area by a long acting local anaesthetic marcain on those physiological functions were investigated during the night and the day in freely moving rats though medial preoptic area influenced sleep wakefulness and body temperature simultaneously the effect on the latter was prolonged the results suggest that the influence on sleep wakefulness is unlikely to be associated with simultaneously changing body temperature however this study fails to differentiate whether the observed effects were due to inactivation of the cell body or the fibers passing through the area
Sleep_Wakefulness	different types of norepinephrinergic receptors are involved in preoptic area mediated independent modulation of sleep wakefulness and body temperature the preoptic area is known to regulate sleep wakefulness and body temperature it was suggested earlier that though sleep wakefulness and body temperature may affect each other the preoptic area mediated influence on those two physiological phenomena is likely to be independent of alteration in each other since intrapreoptic area norepinephrine could modulate both those functions study of that system was undertaken it was hypothesized that since the preoptic area has different types of norepinephrinergic receptors viz alpha num alpha num and beta independent modulation of those two functions was probably due to activation or inactivation of separate receptors hence the effects of different agonist and antagonist of those receptors individually as well as in combination into the preoptic area were studied on those two functions in freely moving rats the results suggest that norepinephrine induced preoptic area mediated influence on the body temperature is primarily regulated by the alpha num receptors while the sleep and wakefulness are regulated by alpha num and beta receptors respectively the finding should help in explaining several poorly understood observations reported earlier and it suggests that similar phenomena may possibly exist in other system involving other neurotransmitters as well
Sleep_Wakefulness	evolutionary aspects of sleep and stress interaction phylo ontogenetic approach this work deals the comparative behavioral somatosensor and neurophysiological characteristics of these forms of passive defensive behavior included in amphibian s sleep wakefulness cycle and their developmental dynamics in the ascending vertebrates secale sleep formation in early postnatal ontogenesis of mature and immature born mammals from undifferent sleep to the mature sleep divided into two phases as well as stress formation are considered in parallel comparative phylo and ontogenetic analysis of several aspects of stress reactions sleep and immobility phenomenon of cataleptic type allows concluding that amphibians and reptilians catalepsy can be interpreted as preadaptive from of behavior underlying in the stress of homoeothermic animals another word the cataleptic state can be considered as the homologic state of stress reaction catalepsy is the genetically programmed state of poykilothermic animals characterized by comparatively high alertness of animal its freezing in immobile but active posture with a possibility of fast exit into waking state and alongside with other somatosensor and neurophysiological characteristics determines the entire subsequent complex of evolutionary morphofunctional neurophysiological and hormonal changes in nomoyptherms this in many aspects unspecific behavioral adaptive reaction in poykilotherms is realized on the corresponding hormonal and neurophysiological levels of development and promotes to fast mobilization and stabilization their homeostasis at the higher evolutionary scale after development of most brain neurotransmitter and hypothalamo pituitary adrenal systems the leading role in stress regulation begins to be predominent the hormonal reaction only in the alertness phase of stress reaction the elements of activation of extrapyramidal regulatory system of locomotion are observed this is manifested by the cateleptic immobility thus the stress as the general adaptational syndrome reflects the evolutionary regularities of development of specific functions supporting the total homeostasis the scheme of evolution of sleep wakefulness cycle in vertebrates is presented according to it the immobility state of cataleptic type on one hand may to considered as a part of wakefulness providing mainly specific elements of stress reaction while on other hand it is a certain step of inhibitory processes in for subsequent involvement of sleep regulatory systems for the compensation and maintenance of recovery reactions

Sleep_Wakefulness	psychosis in parkinson s disease without dementia common and comorbid with other non motor symptoms psychosis in parkinson s disease is common and associated with a range of negative outcomes dementia and psychosis are highly correlated in but the frequency and correlates of psychosis in patients without cognitive impairment are not well understood one hundred and ninety one non demented patients at two movement disorders centers participated in a study of neuropsychiatric complications in and completed a detailed neurological and neuropsychiatric assessment including the rater administered parkinson psychosis rating scale for hallucinations delusions and minor symptoms of psychosis illusions and misidentification of persons psychotic symptoms were present in num num of the sample visual hallucinations were most common num num followed by auditory hallucinations num num illusions or misidentification of people num num and paranoid ideation num num visual hallucinations and illusions or misidentification of people were the most common comorbid symptoms num num depression num num and rapid eye movement behavior disorder symptoms num num were associated with psychosis in a multivariable model the odds of experiencing psychotic symptoms were approximately five times higher in patients with comorbid disorders of depression and sleep wakefulness even in patients without global cognitive impairment psychosis in is common and most highly correlated with other non motor symptoms screening for psychosis should occur at all stages of as part of a broad non motor assessment in addition these findings suggest a common neural substrate for disturbances of perception mood sleep wakefulness and incipient cognitive decline in

Sleep_Wakefulness	receptors in mpoah simultaneously regulate sleep and body temperature in freely moving rats sleep wakefulness and body temperature are two circadian rhythmic biological phenomena the role of gabaergic inputs in the medial preoptico anterior hypothalamus mpoah on simultaneous regulation of those phenomena was investigated in freely moving normally behaving rats the receptors were blocked by microinjecting picrotoxin and the effects on electrophysiological parameters signifying sleep wakefulness rectal temperature and brain temperature were recorded simultaneously the results suggest that normally in the medial preoptic area acts through receptor that induces sleep and prevents an excessive rise in body temperature however the results do not allow us to comment on the cause and effect relationship if any between changes in sleep wakefulness and body temperature the changes in brain and rectal temperatures showed a positive correlation however the former varied within a narrower range than that of the latter
Sleep_Wakefulness	amino acid release from the rat oral pontine reticular nucleus across the sleep wakefulness cycle to elucidate a functional involvement of amino acids in the regulation of vigilance states we investigated time course changes of glycine gly glutamate glu and glutamine gln in the extracellular fluid of the oral pontine reticular nucleus pno in freely behaving rats by an in vivo microdialysis technique the average concentration of gly in dialysates collected during rapid eye movement sleep was significantly higher than that collected during wakefulness and non rapid eye movement sleep under perfusion with normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid acsf these state dependent changes in gly however failed to occur when the pno was perfused with ca free acsf in contrast the average concentration of neither glu nor gln exhibited state dependency under the perfusion with normal or ca free acsf however the concentrations of all three amino acids showed no consistent time sequential changes specifically in the first three minutes from the beginning of each vigilance state although it is suggested that in the pno the average concentration of gly was higher during than during and by a ca dependent mechanism however time course changes in the amino acids are complicated and other mechanisms may also be influential
Sleep_Wakefulness	some aspects of the polygraphic studies on sleep wakefulness cycle in rat the various phases characterizing the sleep wakefulness cycle were studied in rats electroencephalographic and electromyographic results were both analysed using classical visual methods and more sophisticated techniques such as spectral analysis and hjorth parameters the latter approach was very useful in obtaining a rapid characterization of regional and general brain activity and is applicable to the study of the and profiles of different pharmacological agents together with the conventional studies on the sleep wakefulness cycle the methodology reported here gives a powerful battery for the study of new centrally acting drugs
Sleep_Wakefulness	nitric oxide as a regulatory factor in sleep wakefulness mechanisms although several roles of neuronal nitric oxide have been suggested the capacity of on sleep wakefulness mechanisms is open to discussion we examined the effects of nitric oxide synthase inhibitors on rat sleep using a microdialysis technique when inhibitor was administrated at the central region of diencephalon paradoxical sleep significantly increased coinciding with decrease of wakefulness in the dose dependent manner the effect of on was completely reversed by arginine additionally administration of donor num at the action site of completely inhibited sleep our results suggest that could play a role in the continuation of vigilance around the midline thalamic nuclei
Sleep_Wakefulness	morphine effects in brainstem transected cats and sleep wakefulness in the isolated forebrain in order to examine the prosencephalic mechanisms that might sustain the effects of opiates on and sleep wakefulness the actions of morphine sulfate on the and the pupil size were examined in the chronically isolated forebrain of brainstem transected cats single morphine doses num num num num or num num mg kg i p administered to these animals produced a long lasting desynchronization in the isolated forebrain which was associated with pupil mydriasis the specificity of these morphine effects was shown by the fact that naloxone blocks both the and pupillary effects of the drug after morphine spontaneous synchronized with delta waves normally seen in the isolated forebrain preparation was suppressed for num num h followed by a strong rebound both the suppression and rebound in synchronization with delta waves occurred in a dose dependent manner the duration of these effects closely paralleled previously reported morphine effects on non rapid eye movement sleep in intact cats therefore in relation to the effects of morphine on and sleep wakefulness in intact animals this study suggests that num morphine suppression of sleep and the subsequent arousal state of the animal are mediated by prosencephalic structures num the generation of the typical neocortical slow burst activity produced by opiates depends on lower brainstem structures
Sleep_Wakefulness	dynamics of unit activity of the gigantocellular tegmental field in the sleep wakefulness cycle of rats computer analysis and statistical processing of the unit activity showed that the majority of neurons num num in the gigantocellular tegmental field were discharging with high frequency during active wakefulness and paradoxical sleep as compared to slow wave sleep in unrestrained rats num num of the neurons revealed an inverse pattern of activity they discharged more intensively during slow wave sleep their firing rate decreasing during active wakefulness and paradoxical sleep some neurons num num were found which fired intensively during active wakefulness their firing rate decreasing both in slow wave and paradoxical sleep involvement of the gigantocellular tegmental field in the neurophysiological mechanisms of phases and stages of the sleep wakefulness cycle is discussed
Sleep_Wakefulness	total calorimetric measurements in the rat influences of the sleep wakefulness cycle and of the environmental temperature rates of production as well as dry and evaporative heat loss during the sleep wakefulness cycle were studied in num male adult albino rats with chronically implanted electrodes and thermocouple re entrant tubes two groups of animals chronically acclimated to num or num degrees were acutely studied at num num num num and num degrees statistical analysis of the data shows that rates of heat production and dry heat loss differ with respect to acclimation and acute environmental temperatures and show significant differences depending on the states of the sleep wakefulness cycle rate of heat production was highest during wakefulness intermediate during synchronized sleep and lowest during paradoxical sleep rate of dry heat loss of num degrees was maximal during paradoxical sleep rate of evaporative heat loss apparently did not change with the states of the sleep wakefulness cycle heat storage estimated from difference in rates of heat production and heat loss was positive during wakefulness slightly negative during synchronized sleep and markedly negative during paradoxical sleep the data presented suggest a clear although partial suppression of thermoregulatory mechanisms during paradoxical sleep in the white rat
Sleep_Wakefulness	subchronic alpha ethinyl estradiol differentially affects subtypes of sleep and wakefulness in ovariectomized rats in ovariectomized sprague dawley rats estradiol benzoate has been reported to decrease rapid eye movement and non sleep during the dark phase for up to num days it is unknown however if estrogenic effects on sleep extend beyond num days or if other estrogens could induce the same changes furthermore it is unclear whether the increased wakefulness in the dark phase was due to changes in active or quiet wakefulness therefore we examined the effects of daily injections of alpha ethinyl estradiol for num days on sleep and wakefulness in the rat after num days of baseline recording using a telemetric system rats were administered sesame oil sc for num days followed by injection with num mug rat day sc for num days after treatment sleep was recorded during hormone withdrawal for an additional num days few sporadic but statistically significant increases in light phase sleep occurred during the last num days of treatment starting on day num of the study caused statistically significant decreases in dark phase sleep that were maintained throughout the treatment period and persisted until the rd day of hormone withdrawal during the dark phase statistically significant decreases in sleep and increases in active wakefulness started on the second day of treatment and abated by the end of treatment this study demonstrated that had similar effects on sleep wakefulness to and demonstrates the utility of telemetric polysomnographic recording of the female rat as a model for understanding the estrogen induced changes on sleep wakefulness
Sleep_Wakefulness	neurophysiological neurochemical autonomous and chronobiological basics of sleep medicine the review discusses various mechanisms of the rapidly growing problem of sleep medicine the sleep wakefulness cycle is a continuum of different functional states and the diseases that these states might prompt to manifest themselves in various ways in these cases we must say that change produces the conditions of disease manifestation rather than the disease itself the paper describes the dynamics of the autonomous parameters during sleep emphasizes the role and importance of chronobiological aspects of the sleep wakefulness cycle the holographic principle of the operation sleep cycle is described which persists even in the cerebral stroke from the standpoint of neurochemistry modern hypnotics and drugs of the nearest future can be divided into num groups pros pro sleep for sleeping and antiw anti wakefulness vs wakefulness
Sleep_Wakefulness	in vivo microdialysis measures of extracellular serotonin in the rat hippocampus during sleep wakefulness we investigated extracellular num hydroxytryptamine num levels in rat hippocampus during different stages of the sleep waking cycle using in vivo microdialysis the extracellular num level was highest in active waking and when compared to num level was progressively lower in quiet waking num quiet sleep num and which we termed active sleep num functional implications of related decreased num in the hippocampus are discussed
Sleep_Wakefulness	muscarinic receptors regulate gabaergic transmission in rat tuberomammillary nucleus neurons histaminergic neurons within the tuberomammillary nucleus play an important role in sleep wakefulness regulation here we report the muscarinic modulation of gabaergic spontaneous miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents mipscs in mechanically dissociated rat histaminergic neurons using a conventional whole cell patch clamp technique muscarine a nonselective muscarinic acetylcholine mach receptor agonist reversibly decreased mipsc frequency without affecting the current amplitude indicating that muscarine acts presynaptically to decrease the probability of spontaneous release the muscarine action on gabaergic mipsc frequency was completely blocked by atropine a nonselective mach receptor antagonist and tropicamide an num receptor antagonist the muscarine induced decrease in mipsc frequency was completely occluded in the presence of cd num a general voltage dependent ca num channel blocker or in a ca num free external solution however pharmacological agents affecting adenylyl cyclase or protein coupled inwardly rectifying channel activity did not prevent the inhibitory action of muscarine on gabaergic mipscs these results suggest that muscarine acts on num receptors on gabaergic nerve terminals projecting to histaminergic neurons to inhibit spontaneous release via the inhibition of ca num influx from the extracellular space muscarine also inhibited action potential dependent release by activating presynaptic num receptors in more physiological conditions the num receptor mediated modulation of gabaergic transmission onto neurons may contribute to the regulation of sleep wakefulness
Sleep_Wakefulness	drug effects on sleep wakefulness patterns in dogs sleep wakefulness patterns in dogs were studied using computerized on line analysis and off line sleep stage classification short description of the methods is given and the results of the analysis are discussed touching on the problem of similarities and dissimilarities with sleep wakefulness patterns in cats examples are given of species differences with respect to the effects of narcotic analgesics the predictability of results obtained in the dog with respect to humans is discussed using as an example the sedative effects of antihistamines and the absence of such effects in response to a specific antagonist astemizole the role of neurotransmitters in sleep is studied especially the role of dopamine by using dopamine antagonists pimozide domperidone and dopamine agonists apomorphine
Sleep_Wakefulness	sleep wake fluctuations and respiratory events during cheyne stokes respiration in patients with heart failure fluctuations in sleep wake state are thought to contribute to the respiratory instability of cheyne stokes respiration in patients with heart failure by promoting the rhythmic occurrence of central apnea and ventilatory overshoot there are no data however on the relationship between vigilance state and respiratory events in this study we used a novel method to detect the occurrence of state transitions time resolution num num s minimum duration of state changes num s and to assess their time relationship with apnoeic events we also evaluated whether end apnoeic arousals are associated with a ventilatory overshoot polysomnographic daytime laboratory recording num min was performed during cheyne stokes respiration in num patients with heart failure automatic state classification included wakefulness and non rapid eye movement sleep stages num num as a rule wakefulness occurred during hyperpnoeic phases and non rapid eye movement sleep occurred during apnoeic events ninety two percent of the observed central apneas num were associated with a concurrent wakefulness non rapid eye movement sleep wakefulness transition the delay between wakefulness non rapid eye movement sleep transitions and apnea onset was num num num num num num s median lower quartile upper quartile num num testing the null hypothesis median delay num and the delay between non rapid eye movement sleep wakefulness transitions and apnea termination was num num num num num num s num num positive negative delay indicates that the state transition occurred before after the onset or termination of apnea non rapid eye movement sleep wakefulness transitions synchronous with apnea termination were associated with a threefold increase in tidal volume and a twofold increase in ventilation all num num indicating ventilatory overshoot these findings highlight that wakefulness non rapid eye movement sleep wakefulness transitions parallel apnoeic events during cheyne stokes respiration in patients with heart failure the relationships between state changes and respiratory events are consistent with the notion that state fluctuations promote ventilatory instability
Sleep_Wakefulness	anatomic functional relationships between the motor systems and the sleep wakefulness systems the present paper deals with relationships between neural systems which control motor behaviour pyramidal and extrapyramidal and sleep wakefulness states in particular the reticular formation we examined successively their anatomical and neurochemical substrates electrophysiological and functional motor alterations depending on ascending and descending influences from brain stem during the sleep wakefulness cycle these data suggest that sleep wake states result from the modulation of excitability in neuronal pools and that each state results from the co ordinated working of several functionally different neuronal pools thus each state could be understood as a sum of behavioural events depending on a neural network we hypothesized that abnormal motor events occurring specifically during a sleep state could result from motor structures abnormally recruited in neural networks specifically involved in this sleep state
Sleep_Wakefulness	influence of inhibitory serotonergic inputs to orexin hypocretin neurons on the diurnal rhythm of sleep and wakefulness serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nuclei receive excitatory input from hypothalamic orexin hypocretin neurons and reciprocally inhibit orexin neurons through the receptor however the physiological significance of this negative feedback circuit for sleep wakefulness regulation is little understood receptor expression level was specifically and reversibly controlled in the orexin neurons using the tet off system the responsiveness of orexin neurons to in vitro and the sleep wakefulness patterns were compared between overexpressing and control mice when the receptor was overexpressed in orexin neurons of orexin orexin tta teto htra mice induced inhibition of orexin neurons was prolonged in the absence of doxycycline orexin tta teto htra mice exhibited severe fragmentation of sleep wakefulness during the first half of the dark period the time of maximal activity in nocturnal rodents without affecting sleep wakefulness during the light period when sleep time is maximal however when the receptor in orexin neurons was reduced to basal expression levels in the presence of doxycycline sleep wakefulness patterns in orexin tta teto htra mice during the early active period were indistinguishable from those of littermate teto htra mice these results strongly suggest that enhancement of inhibitory serotonergic input to orexin neurons caused fragmentation of wakefulness in contrast sleep wakefulness architecture in the light period was unaffected by receptor overexpression in the orexin neurons inhibitory serotonergic input likely functions as negative feedback to orexin neurons in the early dark period and helps stabilize wakefulness bouts thereby contributing to the diurnal rhythm of sleep and wakefulness
Sleep_Wakefulness	neuronal correlates of sleep wakefulness and arousal in a diurnal insect the discovery that various states of sleep rest wakefulness and arousal in man can be correlated with specific forms of the electroencephalogram has led to intensive studies of these states mostly in mammals num today it is generally accepted that circadian sleep wakefulness cycles occur in mammals and birds num num behavioural observations on sleep in moths have also been published many other invertebrates demonstrate rest activity cycles circadian sensitivity fluctuations in both central and peripheral num components of the visual system of various nocturnal arthropod species have been demonstrated we now report that long term extracellular single unit recordings from optomotor interneurones in the optic lobes of forager honey bees reveal an oscillation in their sensitivity to moving visual stimuli num the oscillation displays properties typical of a circadian rhythm num the sensitivity of the neurons is higher during the subjective day than during the subjective night the locomotor activity of individual fixed walking forager bees shows a similar circadian oscillation and is also higher during the subjective day visual and mechanical stimuli can act directly on the interneurones and restore their sensitivity during times of reduced neuronal responsiveness comparison with results available for mammals makes it likely that the neuronal phenomena presented here are correlates of the bee s circadian sleep wakefulness rhythm
Sleep_Wakefulness	neuronal firing in the pallidal region firing patterns during sleep wakefulness cycle in cats neuronal activity was investigated by extracellular microelectrodes in the pallidal region of freely moving cats during wakefulness slow wave sleep and paradoxical sleep the firing of num units from num points was examined on the basis of the modifications of firing rates and patterns during the sleep wakefulness cycle num groups of neurons were distinguished two of these groups were characterized by strong increase of firing rate in and and in one of them this increase preceded the cortical activation at the transition by an average of num sec the role played by the basal forebrain area in the regulation of the sleep wakefulness cycle is discussed
Sleep_Wakefulness	regulatory effect of ventral tegmental area on sleep wakefulness in rats experiments were performed on num male rats the results were as follows num the time of waking was increased during the second and third hours after microinjection of num num and num num nmol bromocriptine into bilateral num num but the num num nmol group was without significant effect num the time of waking was decreased during the second and third hours after microinjection of num and num nmol into num num and num num respectively while num num nmol sulpiride group was without effect num one week after administration of kainic acid num num microgram the rats presented less time of waking in the day num num while sleep wakefulness cycle at night showed no change the results suggest that bromocriptine could increase wakefulness by activating neurons via receptor and that the neurons might exert a tonic effect for maintaining the wakefulness at the daytime
Sleep_Wakefulness	centralis superior raphe reticularis pontis nuclei and sleep wakefulness cycle in cats this study examines the influence of lesions in the centralis superior raphe nucleus cesr and adjacent paramedial pontine tegmentum on the sleep wakefulness cycle in cats sixteen cats had electrodes implanted for electro oculogram electromyogram electroencephalogram and ponto geniculo occipital recordings there were num experimental animals seven animals received diathermocoagulation lesions destroying between num and num of the cesr the remaining three cats suffered bilateral lesions in the paramedial portion of the reticularis pontis oralis and caudalis nuclei six sham operated animals were used as controls recordings were taken of all animals in continuous num h sessions once a week for num weeks results indicated that the threshold for state changes increase of wakefulness and drowsiness and decrease of slow wave sleep after cesr lesion is approximately num num following volumetric destruction of the nucleus the amount of cesr damage cesr only correlated significantly with the amount of positive correlation and negative correlation during the first week post lesion the changes in over the course of the study were different in the two experimental groups in both groups total was increased with respect to the controls however these increases were observed earlier in the cesr group the return to near control values in state over days num num of the study does not represent a definitive recovery by the cesr cats all the states returned to control values by the tenth week in the cats with paramedial reticular pontine damage
Sleep_Wakefulness	intracerebral sites of action of estrogen on the sleep wakefulness circadian rhythm in female rats effects of estradiol on the sleep wakefulness circadian rhythm were studied in ovariectomized female rats under a num num light dark schedule in rats that were subcutaneously injected with num micrograms of estradiol benzoate or that had crystalline implanted into the third ventricle the total time of slow wave sleep and paradoxical sleep in the night time was significantly decreased on the third day after the administration the suppression of was more remarkable than that of slight increases were observed in the total time of and in the day time these effects of estrogen on the appearance patterns of and in the night and day time could be elicited in spayed rats after crystalline was implanted into the medial preoptic area or the medial amygdala mamyg but the implant into the latter proved less effective cholesterol implants into or mamyg produced no change in the sleep wakefulness circadian pattern implantations of crystalline into the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus or the dorsomedial thalamic nucleus were ineffective these results indicate that is probably the most effective site of estrogen on the sleep wakefulness circadian rhythm of female rats
Sleep_Wakefulness	long term changes in sleep and electroencephalographic activity by chronic vagus nerve stimulation in cats we previously reported the effect of vagus nerve electrical stimulation on sleep and behavior in cats the aim of the present study is to analyze the long term effects of on the electroencephalographic power spectrum and on the different stages of the sleep wakefulness cycle in the freely moving cat to achieve this six male cats were implanted with electrodes on the left vagal nerve and submitted to num rounds of num h continuous sleep recordings in three categories baseline and post stimulus recording the following parameters were analyzed power spectrum total time and number of sleep phases ponto geniculo occipital wave density of the rapid eye movement sleep and the number of times the narcoleptic reflex was present sudden transition from wakefulness to sleep significant changes were detected such as an enhancement of slow wave sleep stage a power increase in the bands corresponding to sleep spindles num num hz and delta waves num num hz with and an increase in the total time number of stages and density of wave in sleep with a decrease of wakefulness in and the eventual appearance of the narcoleptic reflex with the results show that the effect of the changes during different stages of the sleep wakefulness cycle in sleep the effect was present only during while the was affected beyond periods this suggests that ponto medullar and thalamic mechanisms of slow activity may be due to plastic changes elicited by vagal stimulation
Sleep_Wakefulness	changes in the levels of cyclic nucleotides in rat brain during the sleep wakefulness cycle changes in the levels of adenosine num num monophosphate camp and guanosine num num monophosphate cgmp in the discrete regions of rat brain during the sleep wakefulness cycle were studied using a microwave fixation method rats were restrained in a specially designed frame in which they could move their heads and extremities freely and take food and water ad libitum the rats were acclimatized to the microwave applicator for num h a day for num num days and then they were sacrificed by microwave irradiation of the heads under polygraphic monitoring this procedure made it possible to obtain tissue for the analysis of cyclic nucleotides at different times during the sleep wakefulness cycle the content of camp in the various regions of the brain except the cerebellum decreased during sleep in the hippocampus midbrain pons medulla and cerebellum the level of cgmp was highest during wakefulness whereas in the striatum it was highest during paradoxical sleep in the midbrain and pons medulla the level of cgmp was higher during paradoxical sleep than during slow wave sleep these changes of cyclic nucleotide contents may reflect the changes in the release of putative neurotransmitters during the sleep wakefulness cycle our findings suggest that cyclic nucleotides may play some roles in the regulation of the sleep wakefulness cycle
Sleep_Wakefulness	shift work and disturbed sleep wakefulness of the many health related effects of shift work disturbed sleep is the most common this review describes the main observed effects of the three principal shifts night morning and afternoon on patterns of sleep and wakefulness the mechanism of sleep disruption in relation to circadian rhythms and the specific impact of aspects of shift organization speed and direction of rotation are discussed the most troublesome acute symptoms are difficulty getting to sleep shortened sleep and somnolence during working hours that continues into successive days off these are only partially amenable to amelioration by manipulating shift patterns however there is no clear indication that chronic sleep problems result from long term shift work
Sleep_Wakefulness	sleep wakefulness patterns in the helpless rat sleep wakefulness patterns were analyzed during a num day period in the rat in relation to induction of helplessness after a session of inescapable electric footshocks rats did exhibit escape deficits in avoidance conditioning as classically described and their spontaneous sleep wakefulness patterns were not different from those of controls however reduced latency and increased amounts were observed in the helpless group after shuttle box sessions especially during the initial period after the induction of helplessness such modifications of latency and amounts are evocative of the sleep impairments classically observed in endogenous depression
Sleep_Wakefulness	medial preoptic alpha num adrenoceptors in the regulation of sleep wakefulness adrenergic alpha num agonist clonidine and its antagonist yohimbine were locally applied to the medial preoptic area mpoa to find out the role of alpha num receptors at this brain region in the regulation of sleep wakefulness clonidine produced arousal whereas yohimbine induced sleep in freely moving animals behavioural arousal produced by clonidine administration was accompanied by synchronization the alpha num receptor as the probable site of action of externally applied norepinephrine is discussed
Sleep_Wakefulness	sleep wake behaviors in mice during pregnancy and pregnancy associated hypertensive mice study objectives in humans and other mammals sleep is altered during pregnancy however no studies have been conducted on sleep wakefulness during pregnancy in mice in this study we examined sleep wakefulness in female num mice during pregnancy we also examined sleep wake behaviors in an animal model of preeclampsia pregnancy associated hypertensive mice in which increased angiotensin causes hypertension methods sleep wake behaviors of female num and mice were examined based on electroencephalogram or electromyogram recordings before during and after pregnancy to examine whether high blood pressure disrupts the integrity of the blood brain barrier in mice evans blue dye was injected intravenously angiotensin receptor blocker olmesartan administered mice and female tsukuba hypertensive mice were also examined results num mice showed a decreased total wake time and increased nonrapid eye movement sleep time during late pregnancy rapid eye movement sleep time did not change during the course of pregnancy mice exhibited a general slowing of during late pregnancy and subsequently returned to apparently normal sleep wakefulness after delivery all mice exhibited multiple focal leakages of evans blue dye in the brain spike and wave discharges were observed in num of mice olmesartan administered mice did not show general slowing of tsukuba hypertensive mice showed a normal time spent in wakefulness and sleep and a decreased total sleep time conclusions this study showed pregnant stage specific changes in sleep wakefulness in num mice furthermore mice may be useful as an animal model for eclampsia
Sleep_Wakefulness	effect of carbachol injection in the medial preoptic area on sleep wakefulness and body temperature in free moving rats the aim of the present study was to find out the changes in sleep wakefulness and body temperature brought about by application of cholinergic agonist carbachol in the medial preoptic area mpoa carbachol when injected bilaterally into the mpoa of male rats through chronically implanted cannulae produced a fall in rectal temperature and long lasting arousal there was temporal dissociation in the duration of changes produced in the two parameters it is suggested that the cholinergic system at the medial preoptic area brings about arousal response and fall in body temperature through different circuits
Sleep_Wakefulness	role of lateral preoptic area alpha num and alpha num adrenoceptors in sleep wakefulness and body temperature regulation the preoptic area is anatomically divided into medial and lateral portions and both are involved in the regulation of sleep wakefulness and body temperature we have recently reported the specific role of the adrenoceptors present in the medial preoptic area in the regulation of those functions in this study an attempt was made to investigate the specific participation and contribution of the lateral preoptic area alpha num and alpha num adrenoceptors in the regulation of sleep wakefulness and body temperature sleep wakefulness and rectal temperature were simultaneously recorded in freely moving rats both during day and night under normal condition and after bilateral local microinjection of either agonist or antagonist of alpha num and alpha num adrenoceptors into the lateral preoptic area the results suggest that the lateral preoptic area alpha num adrenoceptors are predominantly involved in the regulation of sleep wakefulness whereas alpha num adrenoceptors are more effective in thermoregulation
Sleep_Wakefulness	frontal alpha asymmetry and dream affect alpha oscillations over the right frontal cortex during sleep and presleep wakefulness predict anger in sleep dreams affective experiences are central not only to our waking life but also to rapid eye movement sleep dreams despite our increasing understanding of the neural correlates of dreaming we know little about the neural correlates of dream affect frontal alpha asymmetry is considered a marker of affective states and traits as well as affect regulation in the waking state here we explored whether during sleep and during evening resting wakefulness is related to affective experiences in sleep dreams recordings were obtained from num human participants num men who spent num nights in the sleep laboratory participants were awakened num min after the onset of every stage after which they provided a dream report and rated their dream affect two minute preawakening segments were analyzed additionally num min of evening presleep and morning postsleep were recorded during resting wakefulness mean spectral power in the alpha band num num hz and corresponding were calculated over the frontal sites results showed that during sleep and during evening resting wakefulness predicted ratings of dream anger this suggests that individuals with greater alpha power in the right frontal hemisphere may be less able to regulate i e inhibit strong affective states such as anger in dreams additionally was positively correlated across wakefulness and sleep together these findings imply that may serve as a neural correlate of affect regulation not only in the waking but also in the dreaming state we experience emotions not only during wakefulness but also during dreaming despite our increasing understanding of the neural correlates of dreaming we know little about the neural correlates of dream emotions here we used electroencephalography to explore how frontal alpha asymmetry the relative difference in alpha power between the right and left frontal cortical areas that is associated with emotional processing and emotion regulation in wakefulness is related to dream emotions we show that individuals with greater i e greater right sided alpha power during rapid eye movement sleep and during evening wakefulness experience more anger in dreams may thus reflect the ability to regulate emotions not only in the waking but also in the dreaming state
Sleep_Wakefulness	interrelationship of thermal and sleep wakefulness changes elicited from the medial preoptic area in rats the study investigated the possible interrelationship between changes in sleep wakefulness and body temperature primarily induced by manipulation of the noradrenergic system in the medial preoptic area saline norepinephrine and its alpha and beta blockers were injected in the medial preoptic area and in some control areas of rats during their sleeping and active periods num hydroxytryptamine was injected in the medial preoptic area in another group of animals simultaneous changes in sleep wakefulness and the body temperature were continuously recorded norepinephrine produced hypothermia and arousal whereas alpha adrenergic blockers induced hyperthermia and sleep these changes in body temperature and in sleep wakefulness did not follow an identical time course num hydroxytryptamine induced hyperthermia without affecting sleep wakefulness it is suggested that there are different neuronal mechanisms in the medial preoptic area that bring about the drug induced changes in temperature and sleep wakefulness
Sleep_Wakefulness	inter individual differences in the effects of acute stress on the sleep wakefulness cycle in the rat it has been described that an acute immobilization stress modifies subsequent paradoxical sleep however its effects are complex because some subjects remain unaffected this discrepancy might result from constitutive inter individual psychobiological differences in order to test this hypothesis an inter individual analysis of sleep patterns and their modifications after num min has been performed even though global analysis showed a increase after inter individual analysis evidenced different reactivity subjects which had the least during control recordings were those with the largest increase unlike global analysis an inter individual study evidenced different modifications of wakefulness and slow wave sleep according to individuals subjects presenting the highest amount of wakefulness in control conditions the lowest amount of slow wave sleep decreased their wakefulness amount while subjects with the lowest amount of wakefulness increased it thus individual characteristics of the sleep wakefulness cycle should be considered while studying its modifications induced by different treatments

Sleep_Wakefulness	influence of some monoamine oxidase inhibitors on the sleep wakefulness cycle of the cat the influence of some monoamine oxidase inhibitors phenelzine transamin tranylcypromine nialamide on the structure of the sleep wakefulness cycle of the cat was studied it was shown that these monoamine oxidase inhibitors elicit and increase in slow wave sleep in the sleep wakefulness cycle due to complete suppression of paradoxical sleep and significant decrease in wakefulness after the cessation of the action of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors a selective rebound of wakefulness is observed against the background of complete or partial absence of paradoxical sleep the gives grounds for the hypothesis that during partial deprivation of wakefulness under the influence of monoamine oxidase inhibitors an intensification occurs on the accumulation of specific need for this physiological state the satisfaction of which is accomplished as the result of its rebound in the post deprivational cycle i e after the termination of the of the synchronizing effect of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors
Sleep_Wakefulness	acute effects of toluene on circadian rhythms of sleep wakefulness and brain monoamine metabolism in rats acute effects of a single i p injection of toluene on circadian rhythms of sleep wakefulness were investigated in rats which were chronically implanted with and electrodes for polygraphic recordings the toluene injection produced an initial increase in wakefulness and a subsequent increase in slow wave sleep during the dark period in an attempt to clarify mechanisms of these biphasic effects of toluene on sleep wakefulness rhythms brain monoamines and their metabolites were determined at the times of the initial increase in and the increased the initial increase in was associated with an increase in cortical and num together with a decrease in cortical num hydroxyindoleacetic acid num while the increased during the dark period was associated with an increase in num and a concomitant decrease in num methoxy num hydroxyphenylglycol the toluene induced changes in sleep wakefulness seemed to be manifested at lower blood levels of toluene than the behavioral signs of central nervous system depression these biphasic effects of toluene on circadian sleep wakefulness rhythms are discussed in terms of the reciprocal interactions between central num and neurons

Sleep_Wakefulness	features of the sleep wakefulness cycle in long term isolation the sleep wakefulness cycle was the subject of polysomonographic and actographic studies in two experiments with isolation and confinement of six volunteer operators for num and num days the dynamics of sleep structure was the target parameter before during and after the experiments the sleep structure dynamics and changes in the motor activity differed in their directionality at all the stages of experiments the operators sleep structure had some unique peculiarities discussion is centered around the cases of shortened duration of delta sleep and altered latent periods of specific stages during the off nominal situation with num hour sleep deprivation polysomnographs recorded episodes of latent sleep which became more multiple during the second and were combined with signs of slow sleep and increases in the index of motor activity during night sleep post hence adaptation to changed physical and social environments is manifested by a specific functional restructurization of the sleep wakefulness cycle
Sleep_Wakefulness	effects of afloqualone a centrally acting muscle relaxant on the sleep wakefulness cycle in cats with chronically implanted electrodes author s transl the present study was carried out to elucidate whether or whether not afloqualone has a hypnotic action because of its similarity in chemical structure to methaqualone in the sleep wakefulness cycles during the num hour observation period num num num num afloqualone increased the percentages of resting and slow wave light sleep stages at a dose of num mg kg p o producing a moderate muscle relaxation even at a dose of num mg kg p o where a marked muscle relaxation was produced afloqualone had no influence on the percentage of slow wave deep sleep stage though it increased the percentages of and decreased the percentages of awake and fast wave sleep stages on the other hand tolperisone hcl chlormezanone methaqualone and pentobarbital na used as the reference drugs all increased the percentage of stage but either decreased or had no effect on the percentages of the other four stages at pharmacologically effective doses from these results it was concluded that afloqualone seems to be devoid of a hypnotic action and has different effects on the sleep wakefulness cycle than those of both the hypnotics and the other muscle relaxants used
Sleep_Wakefulness	tonic activity of alpha adrenergic receptors of the medial preoptic area contributes towards increased sleep in rats several studies have suggested that noradrenergic afferents to the medial preoptic area might be involved in hypnogenesis and in lowering the body temperature and that the alpha adrenergic receptors might be mediating these responses this study was undertaken to find out the changes in sleep wakefulness and body temperature in rats when these adrenergic receptors of the medial preoptic area are blocked by alpha selective antagonist prazosin adult male wistar rats were chronically implanted with electrooculogram electroencephalogram and electromyogram electrodes for sleep wakefulness assessment and a bilateral guide cannula for microinjection of prazosin at the medial preoptic area radio transmitter was implanted in the abdomen for telemetric measurement of body temperature in four groups of rats sleep wakefulness was also assessed telemetrically in four other groups of rats sleep wakefulness recordings from these rats were done in a specialized chamber where they could move about freely and select the ambient temperature which they prefer prazosin induced a dose dependent increase in wake period and in body temperature when microinjected into the medial preoptic area results suggest that preoptic alpha adrenergic receptors mediate hypnogenic and hypothermic responses it is proposed that the noradrenergic afferents to the medial preoptic area by tonic activation of alpha adrenergic receptors contribute towards increase in sleep especially during the daytime

Sustained_Threat	effect of attention control on sustained attention during induced anxiety anxiety has wide reaching and complex effects on cognitive performance although it can intrude on cognition and interfere with performance it can also facilitate information processing and behavioural responses in a previous study we showed that anxiety induced by threat of shock facilitates performance on the sustained attention to response task a vigilance test which probes response inhibition to infrequent nogo stimuli the present study sought to identify factors that may have contributed to such improved performance including on and off task thinking assessed with thought probes and individual differences in attention control as measured with the attention control scale replicating our prior finding we showed that shock threat significantly reduced errors of commission on the nogo trials however we extended this finding in demonstrating that this effect was driven by subjects with low attention control we therefore confirm that anxiety increases inhibitory control of prepotent responses a mechanism which is adaptive under threat and show that this effect is greater in those who rely more upon such prepotent responding i e those with low attentional control

Sustained_Threat	biomaterial surfaces self defensive against bacteria by contact transfer of antimicrobials despite extensive engineering of tissue contacting biomedical devices to control healing these devices remain susceptible to bacterial colonization biofilm formation and chronic infection the threat of selecting for resistance genes largely precludes sustained antimicrobial elution as a wide spread clinical solution in response self defensive surfaces have been developed where antimicrobial is released only when and where there is a bacterial challenge we explore a new self defensive approach using anionic microgels into which small molecule cationic antimicrobials are loaded by complexation we identify conditions where antimicrobial remains sequestered within the microgels for periods as long as weeks however bacterial contact triggers release and leads to local bacterial killing we speculate that the close proximity of bacteria alters the local thermodynamic environment and interferes with the microgel antimicrobial complexation the contact transfer approach does not require bacterial metabolism but instead appears to be driven by differences between the microgels and the bacterial cell envelope where there is a high concentration of negative charge and hydrophobicity contact with metabolizing macrophages or osteoblasts is however insufficient to trigger antimicrobial release indicating that contact transfer can be specific to bacteria and suggesting an avenue to biomedical device surfaces that can simultaneously promote healing and resist infection

Sustained_Threat	changes in bleaching susceptibility among corals subject to ocean warming and recurrent bleaching in moorea french polynesia climate induced coral bleaching poses a major threat to coral reef ecosystems mostly because of the sensitivities of key habitat forming corals to increasing temperature however susceptibility to bleaching varies greatly among coral genera and there are likely to be major changes in the relative abundance of different corals even if the wholesale loss of corals does not occur for several decades here we document variation in bleaching susceptibility among key genera of reef building corals in moorea french polynesia and compare bleaching incidence during mass bleaching events documented in num num num and num this study compared the proportion of colonies that bleached for four major genera of reef building corals acropora montipora pocillopora and porites during each of four well documented bleaching events from num to num acropora and montipora consistently bleached in far greater proportions up to num than pocillopora and porites however there was an apparent and sustained decline in the proportion of colonies that bleached during successive bleaching events especially for acropora and montipora in num only num of acropora colonies bleached compared with num in num temporal variation in the proportion of coral colonies bleached may be attributable to differences in environmental conditions among years alternately the sustained declines in bleaching incidence among highly susceptible corals may be indicative of acclimation or adaptation coral genera that are highly susceptible to coral bleaching and especially acropora and montipora exhibit temporal declines in their susceptibility to thermal anomalies at moorea french polynesia one possible explanation for these findings is that gradual removal of highly susceptible genotypes through selective mortality of individuals populations and or species is producing a coral assemblage that is more resistant to sustained and ongoing ocean warming
Sustained_Threat	strategies for serum chemokine cytokine assessment as biomarkers of therapeutic response in patients as a prototype to monitor immunotherapy of infectious diseases in this study strategies for serum biomarker assessment were developed for therapeutic monitoring of patients for this purpose serum chemokine cytokine levels were measured by cytometric bead array in patients categorized according to immunotherapy response as non responder relapser and sustained virologic responder the results demonstrated an overall increase of serum chemokine cytokine levels in patients in general therapeutic failure was associated with presence of a predominant baseline proinflammatory pattern with enhanced alpha gamma along with decreased num levels in and increased num and in displayed lower baseline proinflammatory status with decreased num num and num levels the inability to uphold alpha levels during immunotherapy was characteristic of serum chemokine cytokine signatures further support the deleterious effect of proinflammatory baseline status and the critical role of increased persistent alpha levels to guarantee the sustained virologic response the prominent baseline proinflammatory milieu observed in and yielded a restricted biomarker network with small number of neighborhood connections whereas displayed a network with integrated cytokine connectivity noteworthy was that presented a shift towards a proinflammatory pattern upon immunotherapy assuming a pattern similar to that observed in and at baseline moreover the immunotherapy guided towards a profile similar to at baseline analysis of baseline fold changes during treatment pointed out alpha and as high performance biomarkers to monitor immunotherapy outcome this knowledge may contribute for novel insights into the treatment and control of the continuous public health threat posed by infection worldwide
