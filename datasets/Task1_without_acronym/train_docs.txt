Sleep_Wakefulness	reflection of tolerance to alcohol in the structure of the sleep wakefulness cycle the purpose of the present work was to study the effects of tolerance to ethanol on the sleep wakefulness cycle structure experiments were carried out in chronic conditions on the adult cats n num the following methods were used the stereotaxic for implanting electrodes polysomnographic for registration of the structure alcoholisation num num num num g kg num ethanol solution was conducted by intraperitoneal injections that lasted for two weeks the obtained results were processed statistically and significance of the changes was determined by the student t test low single doses of ethanol num num num num g kg did not induce any significant changes in the structure of the while using doses of num num g kg it was noted only increasing of the latent period of the onset of sleep however the structure of the recovered within num num hours after injection increasing the dose to num g kg caused severe intoxication this was reflected in a behavioral anxiety tremor vocalizations and autonomic vomiting and frequent urination signs against the background of restless behavioral wakefulness synchronization of the characteristic of light slow wave sleep developed the volume of deep slow wave sleep was statistically significantly decreased and the latent period of the onset of paradoxical sleep was increased the structure of sleep was fragmented due to frequent awakenings for the fifth eighth day of alcoholization the structure of the restored behavioral and vegetative signs of intoxication disappeared which must indicate the development of tolerance to this dose of ethanol the obtained results signify that development of tolerance to ethanol can be reflected in the alteration of the structure of alcoholization disturbs the subtle mechanisms of the sleep due to destruction of brain homeostasis
Sleep_Wakefulness	patterns in sleep wakefulness in three month old infants exposed to methadone or buprenorphine infants exposed to opioides in utero frequently demonstrate withdrawal symptoms in the neonatal period and have difficulties with state regulation this study examines sleep wakefulness distress patterns as indicators of regulatory mechanisms at num months of age national infant cohort num born to women in high dose maintenance treatment during pregnancy and a comparison group num of low risk infants born in the same period distributions and frequencies of sleep wakefulness and distress measured in hours and episodes on sleep charts recorded by the mothers in the two groups women in maintenance treatment were monitored closely during pregnancy to avoid illicit drug use and to be prepared for motherhood they were also offered residential treatment before pregnancy and after the child was born there were no statistical differences between the two groups in any of the num measures reflecting diurnal and nocturnal rhythmicity at num months despite of neonatal abstinence syndrome in num of the exposed infants and significant differences in infant characteristics with respect to birth weight gestational age and maternal characteristics follow up procedures combining drug monitoring and counseling during pregnancy and in the first months after birth enhance the development of state regulation in terms of sleep wakefulness patterns
Sleep_Wakefulness	modulation by the hypocretinergic orexinergic neurotransmission system in sleep wakefulness cycle states the hypocretins orexins are neuropeptides synthesized by a small neuronal cell group located in the posterior and lateral hypothalamus these peptides have been considered modulators of the sleep wakefulness cycle since their discovery in num the hypocretinergic orexinergic system is very active during wakefulness in addition the absence of either these peptides or their receptors is associated to narcolepsy cataplexy a disease in which the sleep wakefulness cycle is completely disorganized hypocretinergic orexinergic neurons directly activate the cerebral cortex and neuronal cell groups of the reticular activating system containing noradrenaline serotonin dopamine acetylcholine and histamine through which they may also indirectly activate the cerebral cortex and enhance wakefulness as well these neurons inhibit sleep generation in the ventral pontine tegmentum the decrease in the activity of hypocretinergic orexinergic neurons during sleep inhibits the aminergic and cholinergic neurons of the reticular activating core decreasing cortical activation and renewing sleep generation in the ventral pontine tegmentum hypocretins orexins modulate wakefulness and activation in part through their actions on reticular core neurons projecting to the cortex and suppress sleep generation through inhibition of ventral pontine tegmentum neurons within the ventral oral pontine tegmentum the hypoactivity of this system supports the sleep cycle fragmentation and general disorganization appearing in narcolepsy as well as momentary interruption of wakefulness by sleep episodes
Loss	otitis media and child development should we worry persistent middle ear effusion in infancy and early childhood has been blamed for impairments of speech language cognition and psychosocial development later in life whether that blame is justified remains unresolved and a matter of controversy because studies of the relationships involved have been limited and often contradictory and because none was designed so as to address the issue of causality at issue in particular is the common practice of subjecting infants and young children with persistent otitis media with effusion to tympanostomy tube placement specifically to reduce the risk of developmental impairment currently children younger than age num years undergo an estimated num tympanostomy tube placement operations per year at a cost of about num million if a causal association between early life and later developmental impairment were to be established answers would also be needed to the questions whether the adverse effects of are linear or threshold whether they are permanent or transient and whether they are preventable by timely tube placement prospective study designed to address all of these questions is currently under way at children s hospital of pittsburgh the study involves enrolling a large demographically diverse sample of normal infants before num months of age monitoring them for the presence or absence of otitis media throughout the first num years of life identifying those in whom has persisted for specified minimum periods randomly assigning those subjects either to prompt tube placement or to delayed tube placement if persists and administering a battery of standardized developmental tests to those subjects and to a sample of the others at ages num num and num years details of the study design and procedures are described in this report

Sustained_Threat	attentional biases to emotional stimuli key components of the rdoc constructs of sustained threat and loss biased attention to emotional stimuli plays a key role in the rdoc constructs of sustained threat and loss in this article we review approaches to assessing these biases their links with psychopathology and the underlying neural influences we then review evidence from twin and candidate gene studies regarding genetic influences on attentional biases we also discuss the impact of developmental and environmental influences and end with a number of suggestions for future research in this area
Sustained_Threat	exaggerated neurobiological sensitivity to threat as a mechanism linking anxiety with increased risk for diseases of aging anxiety disorders increase risk for the early development of several diseases of aging elevated inflammation a common risk factor across diseases of aging may play a key role in the relationship between anxiety and physical disease however the neurobiological mechanisms linking anxiety with elevated inflammation remain unclear in this review we present a neurobiological model of the mechanisms by which anxiety promotes inflammation specifically we propose that exaggerated neurobiological sensitivity to threat in anxious individuals may lead to sustained threat perception which is accompanied by prolonged activation of threat related neural circuitry and threat responsive biological systems including the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis autonomic nervous system and inflammatory response over time this pattern of responding can promote chronic inflammation through structural and functional brain changes altered sensitivity of immune cell receptors dysregulation of the axis and and accelerated cellular aging chronic inflammation in turn increases risk for diseases of aging exaggerated neurobiological sensitivity to threat may thus be a treatment target for reducing disease risk in anxious individuals
Sleep_Wakefulness	arousal transitions in sleep wakefulness and anesthesia are characterized by an orderly sequence of cortical events many aspects of brain function are influenced by modulatory processes including arousal the most abrupt changes in arousal occur at the wake sleep transition and at the induction of anesthetic conditions they are accompanied by major electrophysiological changes including an emergence of low frequency sleep like activity and a loss of mid frequency wake like activity that has been linked to feedback processes of the brain nevertheless the causal relationship between these two types of electrophysiological changes as well as the cortical mechanisms underlying changes in arousal and consciousness remain poorly understood to address this we studied spontaneous electro cortical activity during arousal changes in macaques during sleep and at loss of consciousness induced by propofol anesthesia we identified a prototypical sequence of cortical events in which the loss of mid frequency activity preceded by seconds the increases in low frequency activity furthermore in visual areas an influence of mid frequency change onto high frequency activity was observed across visual hierarchy these results are consistent with the notion that drops in arousal and consciousness are facilitated by a release of feedback cortical inhibition
Circadian_Rhythms	circadian rhythm sleep wake disorders in older adults the timing duration and consolidation of sleep result from the interaction of the circadian timing system with a sleep wake homeostatic process when aligned and functioning optimally this allows wakefulness throughout the day and a long consolidated sleep episode at night mismatch between the desired timing of sleep and the ability to fall and remain asleep is a hallmark of the circadian rhythm sleep wake disorders this article discusses changes in circadian regulation of sleep with aging how age influences the prevalence diagnosis and treatment of circadian rhythm sleep wake disorders and how neurologic diseases in older patients affect circadian rhythms and sleep
Arousal	cultural differences in emotion differences in emotional arousal level between the east and the west whether emotion is universal or social is a recurrent issue in the history of emotion study among psychologists some researchers view emotion as a universal construct and that a large part of emotional experience is biologically based however emotion is not only biologically determined but is also influenced by the environment therefore cultural differences exist in some aspects of emotions one such important aspect of emotion being emotional arousal level all affective states are systematically represented as two bipolar dimensions valence and arousal arousal level of actual and ideal emotions has consistently been found to have cross cultural differences in western or individualist culture high arousal emotions are valued and promoted more than low arousal emotions moreover westerners experience high arousal emotions more than low arousal emotions by contrast in eastern or collectivist culture low arousal emotions are valued more than high arousal emotions moreover people in the east actually experience and prefer to experience low arousal emotions more than high arousal emotions mechanism of these cross cultural differences and implications are also discussed
Arousal	mathematical model captures the structure of subjective affect although it is possible to observe when another person is having an emotional moment we also derive information about the affective states of others from what they tell us they are feeling in an effort to distill the complexity of affective experience psychologists routinely focus on a simplified subset of subjective rating scales i e dimensions that capture considerable variability in reported affect reported valence i e how good or bad and reported arousal e g how strong is the emotion you are feeling still existing theoretical approaches address the basic organization and measurement of these affective dimensions differently some approaches organize affect around the dimensions of bipolar valence and arousal e g the circumplex model whereas alternative approaches organize affect around the dimensions of unipolar positivity and unipolar negativity e g the bivariate evaluative model in this report we a replicate the data structure observed when collected according to the two approaches described above and reinterpret these data to suggest that the relationship between each pair of affective dimensions is conditional on valence ambiguity and b formalize this structure with a mathematical model depicting a valence ambiguity dimension that decreases in range as arousal decreases a triangle this model captures variability in affective ratings better than alternative approaches increasing variance explained from num to over num without adding parameters
Sleep_Wakefulness	hypocretin orexin neuropeptides participation in the control of sleep wakefulness cycle and energy homeostasis hypocretins or orexins hcrt orx are hypothalamic neuropeptides that are synthesized by neurons located mainly in the perifornical area of the posterolateral hypothalamus these hypothalamic neurons are the origin of an extensive and divergent projection system innervating numerous structures of the central nervous system in recent years it has become clear that these neuropeptides are involved in the regulation of many organic functions such as feeding thermoregulation and neuroendocrine and cardiovascular control as well as in the control of the sleep wakefulness cycle in this respect hcrt orx activate two subtypes of protein coupled receptors hcrt orxr and hcrt orxr that show a partly segregated and prominent distribution in neural structures involved in sleep wakefulness regulation wakefulness enhancing and or sleep suppressing actions of hcrt orx have been reported in specific areas of the brainstem moreover presently there are animal models of human narcolepsy consisting in modifications of hcrt orx receptors or absence of these peptides this strongly suggests that narcolepsy is the direct consequence of a hypofunction of the hcrt orx system which is most likely due to hcrt orx neurons degeneration the main focus of this review is to update and illustrate the available data on the actions of hcrt orx neuropeptides with special interest in their participation in the control of the sleep wakefulness cycle and the regulation of energy homeostasis current pharmacological treatment of narcolepsy is also discussed
Sleep_Wakefulness	the physiological role of orexin hypocretin neurons in the regulation of sleep wakefulness and neuroendocrine functions the hypothalamus monitors body homeostasis and regulates various behaviors such as feeding thermogenesis and sleeping orexins also known as hypocretins were identified as endogenous ligands for two orphan protein coupled receptors in the lateral hypothalamic area they were initially recognized as regulators of feeding behavior but they are mainly regarded as key modulators of the sleep wakefulness cycle orexins activate orexin neurons monoaminergic and cholinergic neurons in the hypothalamus brainstem regions to maintain a long consolidated awake period anatomical studies of neural projections from to orexin neurons and phenotypic characterization of transgenic mice revealed various roles for orexin neurons in the coordination of emotion energy homeostasis reward system and arousal for example orexin neurons are regulated by peripheral metabolic cues including ghrelin leptin and glucose concentration this suggests that they may provide a link between energy homeostasis and arousal states link between the limbic system and orexin neurons might be important for increasing vigilance during emotional stimuli orexins are also involved in reward systems and the mechanisms of drug addiction these findings suggest that orexin neurons sense the outer and inner environment of the body and maintain the proper wakefulness level of animals for survival this review discusses the mechanism by which orexins maintain sleep wakefulness states and how this mechanism relates to other systems that regulate emotion reward and energy homeostasis

Acute_Threat_Fear	life threatening danger and suppression of attention bias to threat life threatening danger is assumed to produce in tandem increases in both vigilance toward threat and stress related symptoms but no data test the validity of this assumption the authors examined associations in real time among imminent life threatening danger stress related symptoms and vigilance symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder depression and anxiety were measured in a civilian population num as a function of war related stress operationalized as the time available for seeking cover from rocket attack computerized measure of threat related vigilance using a classic dot probe attention task was also collected symptoms depression and anxiety increased as a function of war related threat acute proximal threat was associated with avoidance of rather than vigilance toward negative valence information for participants within rocket range the magnitude of threat bias varied with the magnitude of distress symptoms such that as bias away from threat increased distress symptoms increased these data challenge current thinking about the role of attention in stress responding attentional threat avoidance may reduce the acute impact of imminent threat but this may come at a price in terms of an elevated risk for psychopathology
Circadian_Rhythms	adolescents at clinical high risk for psychosis circadian rhythm disturbances predict worsened prognosis at num year follow up individuals with psychotic disorders experience disruptions to both the sleep and circadian components of the sleep wake cycle recent evidence has supported a role of sleep disturbances in emerging psychosis however less is known about how circadian rhythm disruptions may relate to psychosis symptoms and prognosis for adolescents with clinical high risk syndromes the present study examines circadian rest activity rhythms in and healthy control youth to clarify the relationships among circadian rhythm disturbance psychosis symptoms psychosocial functioning and the longitudinal course of illness thirty four and num participants were administered a baseline evaluation which included clinical interviews days of actigraphy and a sleep activity diary n num participants were re administered clinical interviews at a num year follow up assessment relative to youth exhibited more fragmented circadian rhythms and later onset of nocturnal rest circadian disturbances fragmented rhythms low daily activity were associated with increased psychotic symptom severity among participants at baseline circadian disruptions lower daily activity rhythms that were more fragmented and or desynchronized with the light dark cycle also predicted severity of psychosis symptoms and psychosocial impairment at num year follow up among youth circadian rhythm disturbances may represent a potential vulnerability marker for emergence of psychosis and thus rest activity rhythm stabilization has promise to inform early identification and prevention intervention strategies for youth future studies with longer study designs are necessary to further examine circadian rhythms in the prodromal period and rates of conversion to psychosis among teens

Arousal	the neural representation of an individualized relational affective space humans experience emotions every day traditionally psychology has described emotions through discrete labels e g happy afraid or standardized affective dimensions e g valence arousal and neuroscience has more recently sought the neurobiological basis of emotions via functional neuroimaging however by treating emotions similarly among everyone we neglect that emotions are individualized thus the overall relational structure of an individual s emotion information may be vital in understanding how the brain represents emotions combining behavioral and functional experiments with similarity analyses we demonstrate that neural activity patterns in the left insula correspond to the multi dimensional arrangement of individuals affective spaces despite interindividual differences better than to a group averaged model of affective space a standardized valence arousal space a semantic category space and a visual similarity space this finding suggests that the insula may underlie individual level affective information processing that is specific to one s own affective states which offers new opportunities for functional neuroimaging to inform clinical approaches of disorders involving emotion dysregulation
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	alcohol s effects on emotionally motivated attention defensive reactivity and subjective anxiety during uncertain threats developing a better understanding of how and under what circumstances alcohol affects the emotions cognitions and neural functions that precede and contribute to dangerous behaviors during intoxication may help to reduce their occurrence alcohol intoxication has recently been shown to reduce defensive reactivity and anxiety more during uncertain vs certain threat however alcohol s effects on emotionally motivated attention to these threats are unknown alcohol may disrupt both affective response to and attentional processing of uncertain threats making intoxicated individuals less able to avoid dangerous and costly behaviors to test this possibility we examined the effects of a broad range of blood alcohol concentrations on num participants sub cortically mediated defensive reactivity startle potentiation retrospective subjective anxiety self report and cortically assessed emotionally motivated attention probe event related potential while they experienced visually cued uncertain and certain location electric shock threat as predicted alcohol decreased defensive reactivity and subjective anxiety more during uncertain vs certain threat in a novel finding alcohol dampened emotionally motivated attention during uncertain but not certain threat this effect appeared independent of alcohol s effects on defensive reactivity and subjective anxiety these results suggest that alcohol intoxication dampens processing of uncertain threats while leaving processing of certain threats intact
Sleep_Wakefulness	about evolution of sleep wakefulness cycle in vertebrates data about behavioral somato vegetative and neurophysiological parameters of sleep and wakefulness in insects cold and warm blooded vertebrates are provided hypotheses existing now about evolutionary formation of separate sleep phases and stages in vertebrates are considered in the review are shown the data about correlations of quantitative characteristics of sleep and wake in some mammals with basic metabolic rate lifestyle environmental habits the original experimental results at formation of neurophysiological characteristics of sleep and wake in vertebrates phylogeny and in ontogeny of mature and immature mammals are provided in detail on the basis of own concepts about evolutionary development of sleep wakefulness cycle in vertebrates the interactions of telencephalic diencephalic and rhombencepalic parts of brain in the processes of cycle wakefulness cycle integration are discussed
Loss	investigation of the experiences of mothers living through prenatal loss incidents qualitative study fetal death causes women to experience negative feelings after the loss these lived experiences influence the future pregnancies and maternal health of women negatively the aim of this study was to investigate the experiences of women whose pregnancies were terminated because of medical indications design for definitive status study type of qualitative research design was used ten women who were hospitalized between april and july num at the akdeniz university clinic of obstetrics and gynecology and had subsequently experienced pregnancy loss during their hospitalization were enrolled as participants thematic analysis was used to analyze the data the pregnancy loss experiences of participants were investigated under the five main themes of a lived experiences before the termination of pregnancy b lived experiences after pregnancy termination c willingness to see the baby after termination d posttermination care requirements and e physical condition of hospital rooms during hospitalization the participants expressed feelings of hope fear and worry over being unsuccessful before fetal death and feelings of loneliness disappointment blame and avoidance after fetal death in the aftermath of fetal death health professionals should use insightful and empathic communication skills to help mothers cope with their loss in addition some of the participants wanted to see their babies and some did not thus individualized care is very important for women who experience pregnancy loss
Sustained_Threat	distinct associations between low positive affect panic and neural responses to reward and threat during late stages of affective picture processing abnormal patterns of attention to threat and reward have been proposed as potential mechanisms of dysfunction in anxiety and mood disorders however research on this topic has been inconsistent perhaps because of both clinical heterogeneity in the samples assessed and measurement of attentional biases that is temporally imprecise the present study measured transdiagnostic symptoms of anxiety and depression in num young adults and recorded affect modulated event related potentials in response to task irrelevant pictures in a speeded response task low positive affect was uniquely associated with reduced modulation of later event related potentials i e the and the late positive potential by rewarding images suggesting deficits in sustained attention to reward low positive affect was also associated with a blunted threat elicited late positive potential symptoms of panic were associated with an increased to rewarding images as well as an increased late positive potential to all picture types these data suggest that dysfunction in neural markers of sustained attention to threat and reward relate in specific ways to transdiagnostic symptom dimensions of anxiety and depression moreover event related potentials are likely to be useful in investigations of the time course of attentional abnormalities associated with these symptom dimensions
Acute_Threat_Fear	effects of testosterone administration on threat and escape anticipation in the orbitofrontal cortex recent evidence suggests that the steroid hormone testosterone can decrease the functional coupling between orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala theoretically this decoupling has been linked to a testosterone driven increase of goal directed behaviour in case of threat but this has never been studied directly therefore we placed twenty two women in dynamically changing situations of escapable and inescapable threat after a within subject placebo controlled testosterone administration using functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri we provide evidence that testosterone activates the left lateral in preparation of active goal directed escape and decouples this area from a subcortical threat system including the central medial amygdala hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray this decoupling was specific to threatening situations a point that was further emphasized by an absence of such decoupling in a second experiment focused on resting state connectivity these results not only confirm that testosterone administration decouples the from the subcortical threat system but also show that this is specifically the case in response to acute threat and ultimately leads to an increase in activity when the participant prepares a goal directed action to escape together these results for the first time provide a detailed understanding of functional brain alterations induced by testosterone under threat conditions and corroborate and extend the view that testosterone prepares the brain for goal directed action in case of threat
Frustrative_Nonreward	physical and relational aggression in early adolescence associations with narcissism temperament and social goals this study examined adolescent narcissism temperament frustration and affiliation and social goals in association with peer reported physical and relational aggression num num num years narcissism was positively associated with dominance goals and negatively with closeness goals for peer interaction moreover narcissism was positively associated with physical aggression via dominance goals for boys and with relational aggression via dominance goals for both genders temperamental frustration and affiliation were both positively associated with relational aggression but also interacted in their associations with this variable affiliation was positively associated with relational aggression only at high levels of frustration supporting and extending existing research the present findings suggest that adolescent personality and social goals are meaningfully associated with physical and relational aggression in the peer context
Sleep_Wakefulness	ultradian rhythmicity in sleep wakefulness is related to color in nestling barn owls the possession of a rhythm is usually described as an important adaptation to regular changing environmental conditions such as the light dark cycle however recent studies have suggested plasticity in the expression of a rhythm depending on life history and environmental factors barn owl tyto alba nestlings show variations in behavior and physiology in relation to the size of black feather spots a trait associated with many behavioral and physiological phenotypes including the circadian expression of corticosterone and the regulation of body mass this raises the possibility that individual spottiness could be associated with rhythmicity in sleep wakefulness owlets showed ultradian rhythms in sleep wakefulness with a period length of num num to num num h the period length of wakefulness and non sleep was shorter in heavily compared to lightly spotted female nestlings whereas in males the opposite result was found furthermore male and female nestlings displaying small black spots showed strong rhythmicity levels in wakefulness and sleep this might be an advantage in a stable environment with predictable periodic changes in light temperature or social interactions heavily spotted nestlings displayed weak rhythms in wakefulness and sleep which might enable them to be more flexible in reactions to unexpected events such as predation or might be a mechanism to save energy these findings are consistent with previous findings showing that large spotted nestlings switch more frequently between wakefulness and sleep resulting in higher levels of vigilance compared to small spotted conspecifics thus nestlings with larger black feather spots might differently handle the trade off between wakefulness and sleep attention and social interactions compared to nestlings with smaller black spots
Acute_Threat_Fear	social threat learning transfers to decision making in humans in today s world mass media and online social networks present us with unprecedented exposure to second hand vicarious experiences and thereby the chance of forming associations between previously innocuous events e g being in a subway station and aversive outcomes e g footage or verbal reports from a violent terrorist attack without direct experience such social threat or fear learning can have dramatic consequences as manifested in acute stress symptoms and maladaptive fears however most research has so far focused on socially acquired threat responses that are expressed as increased arousal rather than active behavior in three experiments n num we examined the effect of indirect experiences on behaviors by establishing a link between social threat learning and instrumental decision making we contrasted learning from direct experience i e pavlovian conditioning experiment num against two common forms of social threat learning social observation experiment num and verbal instruction experiment num and how this learning transferred to subsequent instrumental decision making using behavioral experiments and computational modeling we found that both types of social threat learning transfer to decision making in a strong and surprisingly inflexible manner notably computational modeling indicated that the transfer of observational and instructed threat learning involved different computational mechanisms our results demonstrate the strong influence of others expressions of fear on one s own decisions and have important implications for understanding both healthy and pathological human behaviors resulting from the indirect exposure to threatening events
Circadian_Rhythms	chronotype and cellular circadian rhythms predict the clinical response to lithium maintenance treatment in patients with bipolar disorder bipolar disorder is a serious mood disorder associated with circadian rhythm abnormalities risk for is genetically encoded and overlaps with systems that maintain circadian rhythms lithium is an effective mood stabilizer treatment for but only a minority of patients fully respond to monotherapy presently we hypothesized that lithium responsive patients li would show characteristic differences in chronotype and cellular circadian rhythms compared to lithium non responders li selecting patients from a prospective multi center clinical trial of lithium monotherapy we examined morning vs evening preference chronotype as a dimension of circadian rhythm function in num li and li patients from a subset of num patient donors we measured circadian rhythms in skin fibroblasts longitudinally over num days using a bioluminescent reporter per luc we then estimated circadian rhythm parameters amplitude period phase and the pharmacological effects of lithium on rhythms in cells from li and li donors compared to li nrs li rs showed a difference in chronotype with higher levels of morningness evening chronotype was associated with increased mood symptoms at baseline including depression mania and insomnia cells from li rs were more likely to exhibit a short circadian period a linear relationship between period and phase and period shortening effects of lithium common genetic variation in the signaling pathway may account for some of the individual differences in the effects of lithium on cellular rhythms we conclude that circadian rhythms may influence response to lithium in maintenance treatment of

Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	the moderating effect of self reported state and trait anxiety on the late positive potential to emotional faces in num num year old children introduction the emergence of anxiety during childhood is accompanied by the development of attentional biases to threat however the neural mechanisms underlying these biases are poorly understood in addition previous research has not examined whether state and trait anxiety are independently associated with threat related biases methods we compared waveforms during the processing of emotional faces in a population sample of num num num year olds who completed self reported measures of trait and state anxiety and depression results the results showed that the was larger to angry than neutral faces in the left hemisphere though early components were not strongly associated with child anxiety or depression in contrast late positive potential amplitudes to angry vs neutral faces were significantly and positively associated with symptoms of anxiety depression in addition the difference between lpps for angry vs neutral faces was independently associated with state and trait anxiety symptoms discussion the results showed that neural responses to facial emotion in children with elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression were most evident at later processing stages characterized as evaluative and effortful the findings support cognitive models of threat perception in anxiety and indicate that trait elements of anxiety and more transitory fluctuations in anxious affect are important in understanding individual variation in the neural response to threat in late childhood
Sleep_Wakefulness	contribution of num receptor subtypes to sleep wakefulness and respiratory control and functional adaptations in knock out mice lacking num receptors serotonin num hydroxytryptamine num plays key roles in sleep wakefulness regulation evidence indicates that num receptors are involved mainly in non rapid eye movement sleep regulation and respiratory control here we investigated the relative contribution of num num and num receptor subtypes to and breathing during sleep using num subtype selective ligands in wild type num and knock out num mice that do not express num receptors acute blockade of num receptors induced an increase in in num mice but not num mutants which spontaneously expressed less than wild type animals in num mice num receptor blockade produced a reduction of whereas receptor activation induced an increase in this sleep stage these effects were less pronounced in num mice indicating a lower sensitivity of num receptors in mutants with no change in num mrna blockade of num receptors had no effect on in both strains in addition an increase in power density after sleep deprivation was observed in num mice but not in num mice whole body plethysmographic recordings indicated that num receptor blockade in num mice reduced apneas and bradypneas that occurred after sighs in contrast in num mutants apneas were not modified and bradypnea after sighs were more pronounced our results demonstrate that num exerts a num mediated facilitation of and an influence respectively inhibitory on and facilitatory on sleep apnea generation via num receptors moreover num gene knock out leads to functional compensations yielding adaptive changes opposite to those caused by pharmacological blockade of num receptors in num mice
Sustained_Threat	phasic and sustained brain responses in the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis during threat anticipation several lines of evidence suggest that the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis are differentially involved in phasic and sustained fear even though results from neuroimaging studies support this distinction a specific effect of a temporal dissociation with phasic responses to onset versus sustained responses during prolonged states of threat anticipation has not been shown yet to explore this issue we investigated brain activation during anticipation of threat in num healthy participants by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging participants were presented different visual cues indicated the temporally unpredictable occurrence of a subsequent aversive or neutral stimulus during the onset of aversive versus neutral anticipatory cues results showed a differential phasic activation of amygdala anterior cingulate cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in contrast activation in the and other brain regions including insula dorsolateral cuneus posterior cingulate cortex and periaqueductal grey was characterized by a sustained response during the threat versus neutral anticipation period analyses of functional connectivity showed phasic amygdala response as positively associated with activation mainly in sensory cortex areas whereas sustained activation was negatively associated with activation in visual cortex and positively correlated with activation in the insula and thalamus these findings suggest that the amygdala is responsive to the onset of cues signaling the unpredictable occurrence of a potential threat while the in concert with other areas is involved in sustained anxiety furthermore the amygdala and are characterized by distinctive connectivity patterns during threat anticipation
Arousal	recognition of intensive valence and arousal affective states via facial electromyographic activity in young and senior adults research suggests that interaction between humans and digital environments characterizes a form of companionship in addition to technical convenience to this effect humans have attempted to design computer systems able to demonstrably empathize with the human affective experience facial electromyography is one such technique enabling machines to access to human affective states numerous studies have investigated the effects of valence emotions on facial activity captured over the corrugator supercilii frowning muscle and zygomaticus major smiling muscle the arousal emotion specifically has not received much research attention however in the present study we sought to identify intensive valence and arousal affective states via facial activity ten blocks of affective pictures were separated into five categories neutral valence low arousal positive valence high arousal negative valence high arousal positive valence low arousal and negative valence low arousal and the ability of each to elicit corresponding valence and arousal affective states was investigated at length one hundred and thirteen participants were subjected to these stimuli and provided facial set of num features based on the amplitude frequency predictability and variability of signals was defined and classified using a support vector machine we observed highly accurate classification rates based on the combined corrugator and zygomaticus ranging from num num to num num for the baseline and five affective states and in all individuals there were significant differences in classification rate accuracy between senior and young adults but there was no significant difference between female and male participants our research provides robust evidences for recognition of intensive valence and arousal affective states in young and senior adults these findings contribute to the successful future application of facial for identifying user affective states in human machine interaction or companion robotic systems
Sleep_Wakefulness	roles of orexin hypocretin in regulation of sleep wakefulness and energy homeostasis the finding of orexin hypocretin deficiency in patients with narcolepsy suggests that this hypothalamic neuropeptide plays a crucial role in regulating and maintaining sleep wakefulness states and energy homeostasis orexin might be especially important for stabilization of behavioral states because the major symptom in narcolepsy is instability of each behavioral state which results in sleep wakefulness fragmentation the efferent and afferent systems of orexin neurons suggest interactions between these cells and arousal sleep wakefulness centers in the brainstem as well as important feeding centers in the hypothalamus electrophysiological studies have shown that orexin neurons are regulated by monoamines and acetylcholine as well as metabolic cues including leptin glucose and ghrelin thus orexin neurons have the requisite functional interactions with hypothalamic feeding pathways and monoaminergic cholinergic centers and provide a critical link between peripheral energy balance and the central mechanisms that coordinate sleep wakefulness and motivated behavior such as food seeking
Sleep_Wakefulness	functional anatomy of the sleep wakefulness cycle wakefulness sleep is a necessary diverse periodic and an active condition circadian and homeostatically regulated and precisely meshed with waking time into the sleep wakefulness cycle photic retinal stimulation modulates the suprachiasmatic nucleus which acts as the pacemaker for rhythmicity both the light period and social cues adjust the internal clock making the a circadian num h period in the adult human bioelectrical and behavioral parameters characterize the different phases of the for a long time lesions and electrical stimulation of brain structures as well as connection studies were the main methods used to decipher the foundations of the functional anatomy of the that is why the first section of this review presents these early historical studies to then discuss the current state of our knowledge based on our understanding of the functional anatomy of the structures underlying the supported by this description we then present a detailed review and update of the structures involved in the phase of wakefulness including their morphological functional and chemical characteristics as well as their anatomical connections the structures for generation are known as the ascending reticular activating system and they keep and maintain the thalamo cerebral cortex unit awake this system originates from the neuronal groups located within the brainstem hypothalamus and basal forebrain which use known neurotransmitters and whose neurons are more active during than during the other states thus synergies among several of these neurotransmitters are necessary to generate the cortical and thalamic activation that is characteristic of the state with all the plastic qualities and nuances present in its different behavioral circumstances each one of the neurotransmitters exerts powerful influences on the information and cognitive processes as well as attentional emotional motivational behavioral and arousal states the awake thalamo cerebral cortex unit controls and adjusts the activation pattern through a top down action on the subcortical cellular groups that are the origin of the ascending reticular activating system
Sleep_Wakefulness	on the influence of prenatal hypoxia on formation of the orexinergic system and sleep wakefulness cycle in early postnatal ontogenesis of rats the role of orexin in the organization of sleep wakefulness cycle is well known the aim of this study was to examine the terms of formation of the orexinergic system in the rat postnatal ontogenesis and to assess the role of orexin in organization under normal conditions and after prenatal hypoxia realized on days num and num of the embryogenesis was investigated in num day old rats with elect rodes implanted into the somatosensory and occipital cortex immunoreactivity in the orexinergic structures of the lateral hypothalamus was also studied it was shown that in the control num day old animals the orexinergic structures were at the formation stage whereas in the num day old ones they were already formed as in adults in the num day old rats prenatal hypoxia evoked retardation of the orexinergic system for mation terms in the num day old rats the orexinergic system activity after hypoxia was increased with hypoxia on day num activating this system stronger than hypoxia on day num of gestation these changes were reflected in the formation in the num day old rats as shortening of the slow wave phase of sleep increase in the fitful sleep and in the number of transitions from the slow wave to the fast wave phase of sleep the results obtained are discussed in the light of the adaptation compensatory role of the orexinergic system in the postnatal ontogenesis after prenatal damage affecting the central neural system
Sleep_Wakefulness	shift rotation and age interactions with sleep wakefulness and inflammation the interaction of age with shift rotation in relation to sleep wakefulness and inflammation were studied among male employees n num cross sectional analyses in day two shift and three shift work with different shift rotations as well as changes in leukocytes and hscrp among three shift workers who changed their shift system during the num num yr follow up were completed shift work was associated with problems to fall asleep p num num and feeling of the current working time being harmful to sleep and wakefulness p num num quickly forward rotation shift workers considered their working time less harmful compared with slower backward rotation shift workers age did not influence sleep in general but older workers in the quickly forward rotating three shift system had less sleep complaints than their younger colleagues the age differences in the inflammatory markers partly depended on the shift system the results give some support that rapidly forward rotating shift systems are more age friendly than backward rotating shift systems

Arousal	physical activity increases after an affectively arousing daily life event evidence that structured physical activity can help to regulate affective state has spurred interest in identifying associations between unstructured physical activity and affective states during daily life the present study examined whether stressful daily life situations that elicit affective arousal also elicit increased physical activity in the form of restless movement the study compared the physical activity of professors n num after presenting a classroom lecture to their physical activity at the same time of day on a non lecture workday the expectation was that lecturing would increase affective arousal leading to greater restless movement following the lecture compared to the non lecture control day the study assessed subjective arousal to confirm that arousal was higher during the lecture the primary outcome measures were actigraphy measured standing and stepping times and number of steps and posture transitions results indicate that energetic and tense arousal were higher during the lecture than during the control period mean up time standing and stepping for the st minute of the num minute post lecture period was double that of the last minute num num num num s to num num num num s while it remained low throughout the comparison period on the control day p num num subjects also took more steps p num num and engaged in more transitions between sitting and standing p num num after the lecture than after the control period these results support the conclusion that stressful daily life situations that elicit affective arousal also elicit increased physical activity in the form of restless movement and suggest that affective responses to stressful situations may be important determinants of physical activity during daily life
Arousal	using objective real time measures to investigate the effect of actual physical activity on affective states in everyday life differentiating the contexts of working and leisure time in a sample with students multiple studies suggest that physical activity causes positive affective reactions and reduces depressive mood however studies and interventions focused mostly on structured activity programs but rarely on actual physical activity apa in daily life furthermore they seldom account for the context in which the apa occur e g work leisure using a prospective real time assessment design ambulatory assessment we investigated the effects of apa on affective states valence energetic arousal calmness in real time during everyday life while controlling for the context eighty seven undergraduates students age num num num num females num participated in this study apa was assessed through accelerometers during num h palmtop devices prompted subjects approximately every num min during a num h daytime period to assess their affective states and the context we analyzed within and between person effects with hierarchical modeling num num multilevel analyses revealed that both apa and context influenced subsequent affective states the interaction of apa and context did predict energetic arousal only state levels of affects did not differ between men and women for both men and women apa in everyday life has an effect on individual s affective states for valence and calmness it seems to be independent of the context in which the apa occur for energetic arousal men reported to have lower feelings of energy and women reported to have more feelings of energy during leisure time compared to working episodes
Circadian_Rhythms	altered circadian rhythms and oscillation of clock genes and sirtuin num in a model of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy circadian rhythms are affected in many neurological disorders although sleep disturbances are known in epilepsy data on circadian rhythm disturbances in epilepsy are sparse here we examined diurnal and circadian rest activity and sleep wake patterns in kcna null mice which exhibit spontaneous recurrent seizures and are a model of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy furthermore we sought to determine whether seizures or aberrant oscillation of core clock genes and a regulator sirtuin num sirt is associated with disrupted rhythms we used passive infrared actigraphy to assess rest activity patterns electroencephalography for seizure and sleep analysis and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blotting to evaluate expression of clock genes and sirt in kcna null and wild type mice epileptic kcna null animals have disrupted diurnal and circadian rest activity patterns tending to exhibit prolonged circadian periods electroencephalographic analysis confirmed disturbances in sleep architecture with more time spent awake and less asleep although all epileptic mice manifested disrupted diurnal and circadian rest activity patterns we found no correlation between actual seizure burden and degree of sleep disruption however we found attenuated oscillations of several clock genes ie clock bmal per and per and diurnal sirt mrna in the anterior hypothalamus attenuated oscillation of several core clock genes correlates with and may underlie aberrant diurnal and circadian rest activity and sleep wake patterns observed in kcna null mice this could contribute to late complications in epilepsy such as sudden unexpected death in epilepsy sirt may represent a useful therapeutic target for rescuing circadian clock gene rhythmicity and sleep patterns in epilepsy
Frustrative_Nonreward	perpetration of alcohol related aggression by male and female college students an examination of overt and relational aggression existing literature exemplifies the relationship between alcohol and overt aggression especially for adult males less clear is the relationship between alcohol and aggression among male and female college students in particular the nature of this aggression and the co occurrence of drinking and aggression on the same day temporal proximity this study examines the chronic and temporal nature of males and females alcohol related aggression among college students two hundred fourteen students completed a web based num day event level survey measuring alcohol consumption and perpetration of physical aggression verbal aggression anger and relational aggression over num weeks resulting in num num observations days the global analysis revealed students who are heavy drinkers are more likely to perpetrate all four forms of aggression whereas the event level analysis revealed that specific forms of aggression are associated with drinking at the time while other forms were not linked to drinking occasions cross tabulation revealed males and females were more likely to use verbal and physical aggression when drinking for females drinking was also associated with relational aggression and anger despite often being overlooked in research on aggression during emerging adulthood relational aggression was prevalent discrepancies between the global and temporal analysis revealed factors other than alcohol might explain the relationship between chronic alcohol consumption and specific forms of aggression this is one of the first event level studies to show the temporal relationship between alcohol and relational aggression the distinctions in the current study exemplifying the diversity of alcohol related aggression are critical for understanding aggressive behavior potential gender differences and for developing interventions the temporal relationship between alcohol and aggression suggests health interventions should target drinking and aggression simultaneously
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	the unpredictive brain under threat neurocomputational account of anxious hypervigilance anxious hypervigilance is marked by sensitized sensory perceptual processes and attentional biases to potential danger cues in the environment how this is realized at the neurocomputational level is unknown but could clarify the brain mechanisms disrupted in psychiatric conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder predictive coding instantiated by dynamic causal models provides a promising framework to ground these state related changes in the dynamic interactions of reciprocally connected brain areas anxiety states were elicited in healthy participants n num by exposure to the threat of unpredictable aversive shocks while undergoing magnetoencephalography an auditory oddball sequence was presented to measure cortical responses related to deviance detection and dynamic causal models quantified deviance related changes in effective connectivity participants were also administered alprazolam double blinded placebo controlled crossover to determine whether the cortical effects of threat induced anxiety are reversed by acute anxiolytic treatment deviant tones elicited increased auditory cortical responses under threat bayesian analyses revealed that hypervigilant responding was best explained by increased postsynaptic gain in primary auditory cortex activity as well as modulation of feedforward but not feedback coupling within a temporofrontal cortical network increasing inhibitory gamma aminobutyric acidergic action with alprazolam reduced anxiety and restored feedback modulation within the network threat induced anxiety produced unbalanced feedforward signaling in response to deviations in predicable sensory input amplifying ascending sensory prediction error signals may optimize stimulus detection in the face of impending threats at the same time diminished descending sensory prediction signals impede perceptual learning and may therefore underpin some of the deleterious effects of anxiety on higher order cognition
Sleep_Wakefulness	sleep wakefulness variations in arterial stiffness assessment using ambulatory recording of arterial pulse transit time the incidence of cardiovascular events is related to the sleep wakefulness cycle in particular the magnitude and speed of the changes in hemodynamic variables that occur during transitions between wakefulness and sleep and between sleep and wakefulness are regarded as factors that either predict or determine target organ damage and cardiovascular risk although increased arterial stiffness is associated with the development of cardiovascular abnormalities it is not known whether there exist any changes in that are associated with circadian variations in the incidence of cardiovascular events the aims of this study were to assess in healthy subjects over a num hour period to characterize any differences that occur between sleep and wakefulness and to investigate any changes in that occur during the transition from wakefulness to sleep or from sleep to wakefulness twenty healthy volunteers with a dipper circadian blood pressure pattern underwent num hour ambulatory monitoring of blood pressure heart rate and in practice was determined using the aorta brachial pulse transit time and fractional pulsatility indices myocardial oxygen consumption was quantified using the double product an average was calculated for all variables for periods of sleep num num to num num and wakefulness num num to num num and for transitions from wakefulness to sleep num num vs num num and from sleep to wakefulness num num vs num num hours in complete contrast to was greater during sleep than wakefulness num moreover the changes in that occurred during transitions from wakefulness to sleep and from sleep to wakefulness were the opposite of those observed in num arterial stiffness was greater during sleep than wakefulness increased during the transition from wakefulness to sleep and decreased during the transition from sleep to wakefulness
Acute_Threat_Fear	prior stress promotes the generalization of contextual fear memories involvement of the gabaergic signaling within the basolateral amygdala complex fear generalization occurs when a response previously acquired with a threatening stimulus is transferred to a similar one however it could be maladaptive when stimuli that do not represent a real threat are appraised as dangerous which is a hallmark of several anxiety disorders stress exposure is a major risk factor for the occurrence of anxiety disorders and it is well established that it influences different phases of fear memory nevertheless its impact on the generalization of contextual fear memories has been less studied in the present work we have characterized the impact of acute restraint stress prior to contextual fear conditioning on the generalization of this fear memory and the role of the gabaergic signaling within the basolateral amygdala complex on the stress modulatory effects we have found that a single stress exposure promoted the generalization of this memory trace to a different context that was well discriminated in unstressed conditioned animals moreover this effect was dependent on the formation of a contextual associative memory and on the testing order i e conditioning context first vs generalization context first furthermore we observed that increasing signaling by intra midazolam administration prior to the stressful session exposure prevented the generalization of fear memory whereas intra administration of the antagonist bicuculline prior to fear conditioning induced the generalization of fear memory in unstressed rats we concluded that stress exposure prior to contextual fear conditioning promotes the generalization of fear memory and that the gabaergic transmission within the has a critical role in this phenomenon

Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	movements indicate threat response phases in children at risk for anxiety temporal phases of threat response including potential threat anxiety acute threat startle fear and post threat response modulation have been identified as the underlying markers of anxiety disorders objective measures of response during these phases may help identify children at risk for anxiety however the complexity of current assessment techniques prevent their adoption in many research and clinical contexts we propose an alternative technology an inertial measurement unit that enables noninvasive measurement of the movements associated with threat response and test its ability to detect threat response phases in young children at a heightened risk for developing anxiety we quantified the motion of num children num num years old during an anxiety fear provoking behavioral task using an specifically measurements from a single secured to the child s waist were used to extract root mean square acceleration and angular velocity in the horizontal and vertical directions and tilt and yaw range of motion during each threat response phase measurements detected expected differences in child motion by threat phase additionally potential threat motion was positively correlated to familial anxiety risk startle range of motion was positively correlated with child internalizing symptoms and response modulation motion was negatively correlated to familial anxiety risk results suggest differential theory driven threat response phases and support previous literature connecting maternal child risk to anxiety with behavioral measures using more feasible objective methods this is the first study demonstrating the utility of an for characterizing the motion of young children to mark the phases of threat response modulation the technique provides a novel and objective measure of threat response for mental health researchers
Arousal	using activity triggered e diaries to reveal the associations between physical activity and affective states in older adult s daily living evidence suggests that older adults show positive affects after participating in exercise bouts however it is less clear if and how physical activities in daily living enhance affective states too this is dissatisfying as most of older adults physical activities are part of their daily living to answer these questions we used activity triggered e diaries to investigate the within subject effects of physical activity on three dimensions of affective states valence energetic arousal calmness during everyday life older adults num between num and num years took part in the study during three consecutive days physical activity in daily living was objectively assessed using accelerometers affects were measured num min after a study participant surpassed a predefined threshold for activity or inactivity the participants were prompted by an acoustic signal to assess their momentary affective states on an e diary data were analyzed with hierarchical multilevel analyses whenever older individuals were more physically active they felt more energized energetic arousal and agitated calmness however they did not feel better valence interestingly body mass index and valence were associated in a significant cross level interaction acts as a moderating variable in the way that lower scores were associated with higher levels of valence scores after being physically active the innovative ambulatory assessment used here affords an interesting insight to the affective effects of daily activity of older adults these effects are no simple and no linear ones i e physical activity is not associated with positive affects per se as shown several times in experimental studies with single activity bouts rather there is a differentiating association seen as an enhanced feeling of energy and agitation which is not accompanied by a better feeling socio emotional selectivity theory may support the finding that older individuals are emotionally more stable during their day to day life which might explain the non significant effect on the affect dimension valence
Acute_Threat_Fear	chronic cannabis use is associated with impaired fear extinction in humans the use of fear conditioning and extinction paradigms to examine intermediate phenotypes of anxiety and stress related disorders has facilitated the identification of neurobiological mechanisms that underlie specific components of abnormal psychological functioning across species acute pharmacologic manipulation of the endogenous cannabinoid system has provided evidence of its critical role in fear extinction but the effects of chronic cannabis on extinction are relatively understudied in rats chronic cannabinoid administration impairs fear extinction in a drug free state here we examine whether chronic cannabis use is associated with impaired fear extinction in humans participants were healthy chronic cannabis users n num and nonuser controls with minimal lifetime cannabis use n num matched on age sex and race who all screened negative for psychiatric disorders num day differential fear conditioning paradigm was used to test the hypothesis that chronic cannabis use would be associated with impaired extinction of the skin conductance response consistent with hypotheses chronic cannabis use was associated with reduced within session extinction of skin conductance response on day num d num num and between session extinction on day num d num num unexpectedly cannabis use was also associated with reduced subjective differentiation between threat and safety stimuli during conditioning replication and translation of findings are necessary to test potential mechanisms directly and examine whether impairments can be reversed pharmacologically or after a period of cannabis abstinence psycinfo database record
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	anxiety overrides the blocking effects of high perceptual load on amygdala reactivity to threat related distractors amygdala reactivity to threat related distractor stimuli can be abolished in perceptually demanding contexts premised on the biological imperative to respond swiftly to threat we demonstrate however that when participants are threatened by shock greater amygdala responses to fearful compared to neutral distractor faces is preserved under conditions of high attentional demand lateral prefrontal cortices also showed selective responding to fearful distractor faces under these conditions suggesting that threat related distractor stimuli engaged attentional control mechanisms we conclude that anxiety elicited by looming threat promotes neurocognitive processes that broaden attention and enhance sensitivity to potential danger cues even when perceptual systems are taxed

Arousal	conceptualising the impact of arousal and affective state on training outcomes of operant conditioning animal training relies heavily on an understanding of species specific behaviour as it integrates with operant conditioning principles following on from recent studies showing that affective states and arousal levels may correlate with behavioural outcomes we explore the contribution of both affective state and arousal in behavioural responses to operant conditioning this paper provides a framework for assessing how affective state and arousal may influence the efficacy of operant training methods it provides a series of three dimensional conceptual graphs as exemplars to describing putative influences of both affective state and arousal on the likelihood of dogs and horses performing commonly desired behaviours these graphs are referred to as response landscapes and they highlight the flexibility available for improving training efficacy and the likely need for different approaches to suit animals in different affective states and at various levels of arousal knowledge gaps are discussed and suggestions made for bridging them
Sleep_Wakefulness	synaptic interactions between perifornical lateral hypothalamic area locus coeruleus nucleus and the oral pontine reticular nucleus are implicated in the stage succession during sleep wakefulness cycle the perifornical area in the posterior lateral hypothalamus peflh has been implicated in several physiological functions including the sleep wakefulness regulation the peflh area contains several cell types including those expressing orexins orx also known as hypocretins mainly located in the pef nucleus the aim of the present study was to elucidate the synaptic interactions between orx neurons located in the peflh area and different brainstem neurons involved in the generation of wakefulness and sleep stages such as the locus coeruleus nucleus contributing to wakefulness and the oral pontine reticular nucleus pno nucleus contributing to sleep anatomical data demonstrated the existence of a neuronal network involving the peflh area and the pno nuclei that would control the sleep wake cycle electrophysiological experiments indicated that peflh area had an excitatory effect on neurons peflh stimulation increased the firing rate of neurons and induced an activation of the the excitatory effect evoked by peflh stimulation in neurons was blocked by the injection of the orx num receptor antagonist num into the similar electrical stimulation of the peflh area evoked an inhibition of pno neurons by activation of gabaergic receptors because the effect was blocked by bicuculline application into the pno our data also revealed that the and pno nuclei exerted a feedback control on neuronal activity of peflh area electrical stimulation of facilitated firing activity of peflh neurons by activation of catecholaminergic receptors whereas pno stimulation inhibited peflh neurons by activation of gabaergic receptors in conclusion orx neurons of the peflh area seem to be an important organizer of the wakefulness and sleep stages in order to maintain a normal succession of stages during the sleep wakefulness cycle

Circadian_Rhythms	dopamine modulator of circadian rhythms in the central nervous system circadian rhythms are daily rhythms that regulate many biological processes from gene transcription to behavior and a disruption of these rhythms can lead to a myriad of health risks circadian rhythms are entrained by light and their num h oscillation is maintained by a core molecular feedback loop composed of canonical circadian clock genes and proteins different modulators help to maintain the proper rhythmicity of these genes and proteins and one emerging modulator is dopamine dopamine has been shown to have circadian like activities in the retina olfactory bulb striatum midbrain and hypothalamus where it regulates and is regulated by clock genes in some of these areas thus it is likely that dopamine is essential to mechanisms that maintain proper rhythmicity of these five brain areas this review discusses studies that showcase different dopaminergic mechanisms that may be involved with the regulation of these brain areas circadian rhythms mechanisms include how dopamine and dopamine receptor activity directly and indirectly influence clock genes and proteins how dopamine s interactions with gap junctions influence daily neuronal excitability and how dopamine s release and effects are gated by low and high pass filters because the dopamine neurons described in this review also release the inhibitory neurotransmitter which influences clock protein expression in the retina we discuss articles that explore how may contribute to the actions of dopamine neurons on circadian rhythms finally to understand how the loss of function of dopamine neurons could influence circadian rhythms we review studies linking the neurodegenerative disease parkinson s disease to disruptions of circadian rhythms in these five brain areas the purpose of this review is to summarize growing evidence that dopamine is involved in regulating circadian rhythms either directly or indirectly in the brain areas discussed here an appreciation of the growing evidence of dopamine s influence on circadian rhythms may lead to new treatments including pharmacological agents directed at alleviating the various symptoms of circadian rhythm disruption
Circadian_Rhythms	lithium and bipolar disorder impacts from molecular to behavioural circadian rhythms bipolar disorder is a severe and common psychiatric disorder pathogenesis clinical manifestations and relapses are associated with numerous circadian rhythm abnormalities lithium li is the first line treatment in and its therapeutic action has been related to its ability to alter circadian rhythms we systematically searched the pubmed database until january num aiming to critically examine published studies investigating direct and indirect effects of li on circadian rhythms the results from the num retained studies indicated that li acts directly on the molecular clocks delays the phase of sleep wakefulness rhythms and the peak elevation of diurnal cycle body temperature reduces the amplitude and shortens the duration of activity rhythms and lengthens free running rhythms chronic li treatment stabilizes free running activity rhythms by improving day to day rhythmicity of the activity with effects that appear to be dose related pharmacogenetics demonstrate several associations of li s response with circadian genes gskbeta finally li acts on the retinal hypothalamic pineal pathway influencing light sensitivity and melatonin secretion li is a highly investigated chronobiologic agent and although its chronobiological effects are not completely understood it seems highly likely that they constitute an inherent component of its therapeutic action in the treatment of mood disorders
Frustrative_Nonreward	relational aggression and marital quality five year longitudinal study relational aggression occurs in many different contexts including in romantic relationships the current study examined associations between two subtypes of relational aggression love withdrawal and social sabotage and marital quality over a num year time period participants consisted of num married couples who completed a number of questionnaires on relational aggression and relationship quality once a year over a num year period results revealed that relational aggression was highly stable over time and that women used more relational aggression than men men s use of social sabotage and love withdrawal were bidirectionally related to both partners perceptions of poor marital quality over time conversely only women s use of love withdrawal was related to her own perceptions of poor marital quality over time collectively these results suggest that relational aggression by men may be less common though particularly toxic in a marital relationship couples are encouraged to find healthier ways of coping with problems in relationships psycinfo database record
Circadian_Rhythms	evolution of circadian rhythms in drosophila melanogaster populations reared in constant light and dark regimes for over num generations organisms are believed to have evolved circadian clocks as adaptations to deal with cyclic environmental changes and therefore it has been hypothesized that evolution in constant environments would lead to regression of such clocks however previous studies have yielded mixed results and evolution of circadian clocks under constant conditions has remained an unsettled topic of debate in circadian biology in continuation of our previous studies which reported persistence of circadian rhythms in drosophila melanogaster populations evolving under constant light here we intended to examine whether circadian clocks and the associated properties evolve differently under constant light and constant darkness in this regard we assayed activity rest adult emergence and oviposition rhythms of melanogaster populations which have been maintained for over num years num generations under three different light regimes constant light light dark cycles of num num h and constant darkness we observed that while circadian rhythms in all the three behaviors persist in both and stocks with no differences in circadian period they differed in certain aspects of the entrained rhythms when compared to controls reared in rhythmic environment interestingly we also observed that stocks have evolved significantly higher robustness or power of free running activity rest and adult emergence rhythms compared to stocks thus our study in addition to corroborating previous results of circadian clock evolution in constant light also highlights that contrary to the expected regression of circadian clocks rearing in constant darkness leads to the evolution of more robust circadian clocks which may be attributed to an intrinsic adaptive advantage of circadian clocks and or pleiotropic functions of clock genes in other traits
Circadian_Rhythms	maternal circadian rhythms and the programming of adult health and disease the in utero environment is inherently rhythmic with the fetus subjected to circadian changes in temperature substrates and various maternal hormones meanwhile the fetus is developing an endogenous circadian timing system preparing for life in an external environment where light food availability and other environmental factors change predictably and repeatedly every num h in humans there are many situations that can disrupt circadian rhythms including shift work international travel insomnias and circadian rhythm disorders e g advanced delayed sleep phase disorder with a growing consensus that this chronodisruption can have deleterious consequences for an individual s health and well being however the impact of chronodisruption during pregnancy on the health of both the mother and fetus is not well understood in this review we outline circadian timing system ontogeny in mammals and examine emerging research from animal models demonstrating long term negative implications for progeny health following maternal chronodisruption during pregnancy
Circadian_Rhythms	circadian rhythm and the gut microbiome circadian rhythms are num h patterns regulating behavior organs and cells in living organisms these rhythms align biological functions with regular and predictable environmental patterns to optimize function and health disruption of these rhythms can be detrimental resulting in metabolic syndrome cancer or cardiovascular disease just to name a few it is now becoming clear that the intestinal microbiome is also regulated by circadian rhythms via intrinsic circadian clocks as well as via the host organism microbiota rhythms are regulated by diet and time of feeding which can alter both microbial community structure and metabolic activity which can significantly impact host immune and metabolic function in this review we will cover how host circadian rhythms are generated and maintained how host circadian rhythms can be disrupted as well as the consequences of circadian rhythm disruption we will further highlight the newly emerging literature indicating the importance of circadian rhythms of the intestinal microbiota
Loss	the effect of loss and trauma on substance use behavior in individuals seeking support services after the num oklahoma city bombing in this study we examined the effect of trauma exposure on substance use behaviors specifically tobacco and alcohol use in a group of num individuals who sought supportive services after the num oklahoma city bombing self report instrument was used to assess demographics sensory exposure injury interpersonal exposure through relationship with victims peritraumatic reaction grief posttraumatic stress worry about safety functional impairment and changes in smoking and drinking those who reported increased smoking had higher scores on peritraumatic reaction grief posttraumatic stress worry about safety and trouble functioning those who reported increased alcohol intake had higher scores on injury peritraumatic reaction grief posttraumatic stress worry about safety and trouble functioning sensory exposure and interpersonal exposure were not significantly different between those with and without increased smoking or drinking although no causal relationship can be assumed our findings indicate an association of grief and posttraumatic stress with increased substance use behaviors in disaster victims
Acute_Threat_Fear	affective and neuroendocrine effects of withdrawal from chronic long acting opiate administration although the long acting opiate methadone is commonly used to treat drug addiction relatively little is known about the effects of withdrawal from this drug in preclinical models the current study examined affective neuroendocrine and somatic signs of withdrawal from the longer acting methadone derivative l alpha acetylmethydol in rats anxiety like behavior during both spontaneous and antagonist precipitated withdrawal was measured by potentiation of the startle reflex withdrawal elevated corticosterone and somatic signs and blunted circadian variations in baseline startle responding in addition fear to an explicit pavlovian conditioned stimulus fear potentiated startle was enhanced these data suggest that anxiety like behavior as measured using potentiated startle responding does not emerge spontaneously during withdrawal from chronic opiate exposure in contrast to withdrawal from acute drug exposure but rather is manifested as exaggerated fear in response to explicit threat cues
Sleep_Wakefulness	acute psychosis associated with dissociated sleep wakefulness state after mirtazapine treatment tricyclic antidepressants decrease rapid eye movement sleep and may suppress sleep atonia reports indicate that these agents can induce visual hallucinations sometimes characterized as hypnopompic or associated with a dissociated sleep wakefulness state in addition disturbing dreams and confusional states were reported during clinical trials and in subsequent studies to our knowledge only two cases of nightmares associated with mirtazapine a tetracyclic antidepressant have been previously reported we describe a num year old caucasian man with major depressive disorder who started mirtazapine num mg at bedtime because he had poor symptom control with other antidepressant drugs three days later vivid dream activity was noted evolving into realistic nightmares that the patient was not able to distinguish from reality on awakening acute paranoia was suspected and haloperidol was started the dream activity then ended and within num days the patient was able to identify the dreams as unreality haloperidol was discontinued but mirtazapine was continued and the vivid dream activity persisted however reality testing when awake was intact short course of haloperidol restored the patient s reality testing and mirtazapine was eventually replaced with bupropion the unusual nocturnal activity resolved as a result clinicians should be aware of the possible transition from exceptionally vivid dreams to sleep behavior disorder and psychosis based on dream content as an adverse effect of mirtazapine
Circadian_Rhythms	behavior responses of zebrafish danio rerio to aquatic environmental stresses in the characteristic of circadian rhythms as behavior shows a distinct circadian rhythm it is hypothesized that circadian rhythms based on zebrafish danio rerio behavior responses could be affected by contaminants in this study and then the behavior strength of zebrafish exposed to num mg cadmium chloride cdcl num mg dibasic sodium phosphate nahpo num mg deltamethrin and num mg atrazine for num days is used to illustrate the possibility of behavior circadian rhythms as an indicator in the environmental stress assessment statistical analysis with p num num shows that a clear difference between average values of during dark period and those during light period could be observed and h circadian rhythms do exist in zebrafish behavior responses both values and circadian rhythms of zebrafish can be affected in the aspect of periodicity with clear time delay which were h delay in cdcl h delay in nahpo h delay in deltamethrin and h delay in atrazine behavior circadian rhythms were disturbed according to the repetitive cycles after autocorrelation analysis and the toxic effects of different chemicals could be reflected by the profiles of the self organizing map which indicated the circadian rhythm disorder in different degrees these results deduced from the statistical analysis autocorrelation and strongly supported that circadian rhythms based on zebrafish could be used as an indicator in the environmental stress assessment
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	neural correlates of attentional processing of threat in youth with and without anxiety disorders late stage attentional processing of threatening stimuli quantified through event related potentials erps differentiates youth with and without anxiety disorders it is unknown whether early stage attentional processing of threatening stimuli differentiates these groups examining both early and late stage attentional processes in youth may advance knowledge and enhance efforts to identify biomarkers for translational prevention and treatment research twenty one youth with primary anxiety disorders num males ages num num years and num typically developing controls num males ages num num years completed a dot probe task while electroencephalography was recorded and erps were examined youth with anxiety disorders showed significantly larger more positive amplitudes for threatening stimuli than for neutral stimuli and controls showed the opposite pattern youth with anxiety showed larger more negative amplitudes compared with controls controls showed significantly larger more positive and amplitudes regardless of stimuli valence compared with youth with anxiety disorders erps observed during the dot probe task indicate youth with anxiety disorders display distinct neural processing during early stage attentional orienting and processing of faces this was not the case for controls such results suggest these components may have potential as biomarkers of anxiety disorders in youth
Arousal	the relationships between exercise and affective states a naturalistic longitudinal study of recreational runners background although people generally feel more positive and more energetic in the aftermath of exercise than before longitudinal research on how exercise relates to within person fluctuations in affect over the course of everyday life is still relatively limited one constraint on doing such research is the need to provide participants with accelerometers to objectively record their exercise and pagers to capture affective reports aims we aimed to develop a methodology for studying affect and exercise using only technology that participants already possess namely running watches and smartphones using this methodology we aimed to characterize within individual fluctuations in affective valence and arousal in relation to bouts of exercise and explore possible moderators of these fluctuations methods we recruited a sample of num recreational runners participants provided daily affective reports for six weeks using their smartphones information on their runs was harvested from their own devices via an online platform for athletes results average valence and arousal were higher on days when the person had run than on the next day and higher the day after a run than on the days after that over the course of the day of a run valence and arousal declined significantly as the time since the run increased physically fitter participants had more positive valence overall and this was particularly true when they had not run recently there was some evidence of higher dose i e longer and faster runs being associated with lower arousal on the next and subsequent days gender did not moderate associations between running and valence or arousal discussion our study demonstrated the potential for studying the associations between affect and exercise in a way that is precise undemanding for participants and convenient for researchers using technologies that participants already own and use
Circadian_Rhythms	effects of chronic social defeat stress on sleep and circadian rhythms are mitigated by kappa opioid receptor antagonism stress plays a critical role in the neurobiology of mood and anxiety disorders sleep and circadian rhythms are affected in many of these conditions here we examined the effects of chronic social defeat stress an ethological form of stress on sleep and circadian rhythms we exposed male mice implanted with wireless telemetry transmitters to a num day regimen known to produce anhedonia a depressive like effect and social avoidance an anxiety like effect body temperature and locomotor activity data were collected continuously during the regimen and a num day recovery period affected numerous endpoints including paradoxical sleep and slow wave sleep as well as the circadian rhythmicity of body temperature and locomotor activity the magnitude of the effects increased with repeated stress and some changes bouts time body temperature locomotor activity persisted after the regimen had ended also altered mrna levels of the circadian rhythm related gene mper within brain areas that regulate motivation and emotion administration of the kappa opioid receptor antagonist jdtic num mg kg i p before reduced stress effects on both sleep and circadian rhythms or hastened their recovery and attenuated changes in mper our findings show that produces persistent disruptions in sleep and circadian rhythmicity mimicking attributes of stress related conditions as they appear in humans the ability of antagonists to mitigate these disruptions is consistent with previously reported antistress effects studying homologous endpoints across species may facilitate the development of improved treatments for psychiatric illness stress plays a critical role in the neurobiology of mood and anxiety disorders we show that chronic social defeat stress in mice produces progressive alterations in sleep and circadian rhythms that resemble features of depression as it appears in humans whereas some of these alterations recover quickly upon cessation of stress others persist administration of a kappa opioid receptor antagonist reduced stress effects or hastened recovery consistent with the previously reported antistress effects of this class of agents use of endpoints such as sleep and circadian rhythm that are homologous across species will facilitate the implementation of translational studies that better predict clinical outcomes in humans improve the success of clinical trials and facilitate the development of more effective therapeutics
Acute_Threat_Fear	single administration of cortisol acutely reduces preconscious attention for fear in anxious young men chronically elevated activity has often been associated with fear and anxiety but there is evidence that single administrations of glucocorticoids may acutely reduce fear moreover peri traumatic cortisol elevation may protect against development of post traumatic stress disorder hypervigilant processing of threat information plays a role in anxiety disorders and although relations with functioning have been established causality of these relations remains unclear presently self reported anxiety and response time patterns on a masked emotional stroop task with fearful faces were measured in num healthy young men after double blind placebo controlled oral administration of num mg cortisol the masked fearful stroop task measures vocal colornaming response latencies for pictures of neutral and fearful faces presented below the threshold for conscious perception results showed increased response times on trials for fearful compared to neutral faces after placebo but this emotional stroop effect was acutely abolished by cortisol administration this effect was most pronounced in subjects with heightened anxiety levels this is the first evidence showing that exogenous cortisol acutely reduces anxiety driven selective attention to threat these results extend earlier findings of acute fear reduction after glucocorticoid administration this suggests interactions of functioning and vigilant attention in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders possible neuroendocrine mechanisms of action are discussed
Acute_Threat_Fear	sensitivity of late latency auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials to threat of electric shock and the sedative drugs diazepam and diphenhydramine in human volunteers late latency auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials are sensitive to some centrally acting drugs and to certain psychological interventions in this experiment we compared the effects of acute doses of a benzodiazepine diazepam and an num histamine receptor blocking sedative diphenhydramine on auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials within the latency range num num ms in a fear conditioning paradigm twelve healthy males num num years participated in three sessions at weekly intervals in which they received diazepam mg diphenhydramine num mg and placebo in a balanced double blind crossover protocol one hundred and twenty min after diphenhydramine or num min after diazepam they underwent an num min recording period in which auditory evoked potentials elicited by num ms num db num khz tones and somatosensory evoked potentials elicited by a mildly painful electric shock num num ma num ms were recorded at cz vertex each session consisted of four blocks of trials in which either the sound pulse or the shock was presented alternate blocks were designated or context conditions in blocks subjects were warned that shocks would be delivered via electrodes placed on the wrist electrodes were removed during blocks in one and one block the sound stimuli and shocks shocks were delivered only in the block were preceded by a num s conditioned stimulus a red light cue condition diazepam but not diphenhydramine reduced the amplitude of the auditory evoked potential the context was associated with increased and reduced potential amplitudes the had no effect on the amplitudes but markedly reduced the latencies of the and potentials under the condition diazepam reduced the amplitudes of the somatosensory potential evoked by the shock the shortened the latencies of the later components of the response diazepam and diphenhydramine were approximately equi sedative in the doses used in this experiment as judged by visual analogue self rating scales the results indicate that the suppression of late latency auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials by diazepam is not simply a reflection of sedation late latency evoked potentials can be modified by an aversive but the components that are sensitive to the are different from those that are sensitive to diazepam
Loss	sleep quality in treatment seeking veterans of operations enduring freedom and iraqi freedom the role of cognitive coping strategies and unit cohesion sleep difficulties are common in individuals exposed to stress or trauma and maladaptive cognitive coping strategies such as worry and fear of losing vigilance as well as low social support may further impair sleep quality this study examined the severity and correlates of sleep difficulties in a sample of treatment seeking veterans of operations enduring freedom and iraqi freedom total of num veterans seeking behavioral or primary care services completed a questionnaire containing measures of sleep quality combat exposure psychopathology fear of loss of vigilance cognitive coping strategies and unit and postdeployment social support within num year of returning from deployment mean pittsburgh sleep quality inventory scores in the full sample were indicative of severely impaired sleep posttraumatic stress disorder was associated with increased sleep difficulties most notably sleep disturbances daytime dysfunction and sleep quality hierarchical regression analysis in the full sample revealed that symptoms and scores on measures of worry and fear of loss of vigilance were positively associated with sleep difficulties and that scores on a measure of unit member support were negatively associated with sleep difficulties among veterans with fear of loss of vigilance was positively associated with sleep difficulties and cognitive distraction and unit member support were negatively associated with sleep difficulties treatment seeking veterans report severe sleep difficulties with more pronounced impairment in veterans with the results of this study suggest that interventions to mitigate worry and fear of loss of vigilance and to enhance perceived unit member support may be helpful in reducing sleep difficulties following return from deployment in this population
Circadian_Rhythms	the importance of hormonal circadian rhythms in daily feeding patterns an illustration with simulated pigs the interaction between hormonal circadian rhythms and feeding behaviour is not well understood this study aimed to deepen our understanding of mechanisms underlying circadian feeding behaviour in animals using pigs sus scrofa as a case study pigs show an alternans feeding pattern that is a small peak of feed intake at the beginning of the day and a larger peak at the end of the day we simulated the feeding behaviour of pigs over a h period the simulation model contained mechanisms that regulate feeding behaviour of animals including processing of feed in the gastrointestinal tract fluctuation in energy balance circadian rhythms of melatonin and cortisol and motivational decision making from the interactions between these various processes feeding patterns e g feed intake meal frequency feeding rate emerge these feeding patterns as well as patterns for the underlying mechanisms e g energy expenditure fitted empirical data well indicating that our model contains relevant mechanisms the circadian rhythms of cortisol and melatonin explained the alternans pattern of feeding in pigs additionally the timing and amplitude of cortisol peaks affected the diurnal and nocturnal peaks in feed intake furthermore our results suggest that circadian rhythms of other hormones such as leptin and ghrelin are less important in circadian regulation of feeding behaviour than previously thought these results are relevant to animal species with a metabolic and endocrine system similar to that of pigs such as humans moreover the modelling approach to understand feeding behaviour can be applied to other animal species
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	asians demonstrate reduced sensitivity to unpredictable threat a preliminary startle investigation using genetic ancestry in a multiethnic sample research has indicated that individuals of asian descent relative to other racial groups demonstrate reduced emotional responding and lower prevalence rates of several anxiety disorders it is unclear though whether these group differences extend to biomarkers of anxiety disorders and whether genetic differences play a role this study compared self identified caucasian latino and asian persons total num on startle response during a baseline period and while anticipating unpredictable threat a putative biomarker for certain anxiety disorders as well as predictable threat in addition the association between genetic ancestry and startle response was examined within each racial group to determine potential genetic influences on responding for the baseline period asian participants exhibited a smaller startle response relative to caucasian and latino participants who did not differ within each racial group genetic ancestry was associated with baseline startle furthermore genetic ancestry mediated racial group differences in baseline startle for the threat conditions a race x condition interaction indicated that asian participants exhibited reduced startle potentiation to unpredictable but not predicable threat relative to caucasian and latino participants who did not differ however genetic ancestry was not associated with threat potentiated startle in any racial group this study adds to the growing literature on racial differences in emotional responding and provides preliminary evidence suggesting that genetic ancestry may play an important role moreover reduced sensitivity to unpredictable threat may reflect a mechanism for why individuals of asian descent are at less risk for particular anxiety disorders relative to other racial groups
Arousal	affective modulation of the acoustic startle does sadness engage the defensive system it has been suggested that high arousal negative affective states but not low arousal negative affective states potentiate the startle response because sadness has generally been studied as a low arousal emotion it remains unclear whether high arousal sadness would produce startle potentiation to a similar degree as high arousal fear to address this issue num participants viewed two sets of num min film clips selected to induce two affective states of high subjective arousal fear sadness and a neutral state of low subjective arousal while the eyeblink startle response associated with brief noise bursts was assessed using orbicularis oculi larger blink magnitude was found for fearful than for sad or neutral clips implications for conceptualizing sadness are discussed
Loss	anxiety and feedback processing in a gambling task contributions of time frequency theta and delta the feedback negativity event related potential is widely studied during gambling feedback tasks however research on and anxiety is minimal and the findings are mixed to clarify these discrepancies the current study num used time frequency analysis to disentangle overlapping contributions of delta num hz and theta num hz to feedback processing in a clinically anxious sample with severity assessed through general worry and physiological arousal scales greater general worry showed enhanced delta and theta broadly across both gain and loss conditions with theta stronger for losses regressions indicated delta maintained unique effects accounted for theta and explained the blunted time domain for general worry increased delta was also associated with physiological arousal but the effects were accounted for by general worry broadly anxiety related alterations in feedback processing can be explained by an overall heightened sensitivity to feedback as represented by enhanced delta in relation to the general worry facet of anxiety
Sleep_Wakefulness	changes in body temperature and sleep wakefulness after intrapreoptic injection of methoxamine in rats several pieces of evidence suggest that the noradrenergic afferents in the medial preoptic area produce sleep and hypothermia by acting on alphal adrenergic receptors on the other hand in a few studies monitoring body temperature with a rectal probe preoptic injection of the alphal adrenergic agonist methoxamine produced contradictory changes in body temperature and sleep wakefulness such contradictions call for the re examination of methoxamine induced body temperature changes using a better technique like telemetric recording in the present study we monitored body temperature and sleep wakefulness simultaneously after the micro injection of num num num and num micromol methoxamine into the medial preoptic area of adult male wistar rats methoxamine injection produced hypothermia but no major change in sleep wakefulness during the num hours after drug injection except for a short period num min of sleep after num min of injection short period of wakefulness coinciding with the maximum fall in body temperature num min after injection occurred when methoxamine was administered at higher doses the results of this study indicate that alphal adrenergic receptors participate in preoptically mediated thermoregulatory measures that reduce body temperature hypothermia induced by methoxamine might have masked the hypnogenic action of this drug
Loss	does worry affect adjustment to bereavement longitudinal investigation repetitive thought is a trans diagnostic risk factor for development of psychopathology research on repetitive thought in bereaved individuals has focused primarily on clarifying the role of rumination repetitive thinking about past negative events and or negative emotions while detrimental effects of rumination have been demonstrated following bereavement surprisingly few studies have aimed to clarify the role of worry repetitive thinking about potential future negative events in adjustment to loss this study sought to fill this gap in knowledge one hundred eighty three bereaved individuals num num women filled out questionnaires on sociodemographic and loss related characteristics worry and symptom measures of depression anxiety and prolonged grief after six months num participants completed worry and symptom measures again using multiple regression analyses concurrent and longitudinal associations between loss related variables worry and symptoms of psychopathology were examined main results were that worry was strongly positively associated with symptoms of anxiety depression and prolonged grief concurrently and also predicted higher levels of anxiety depression and prolonged grief longitudinally findings suggest that worry influences adjustment to bereavement negatively and may be a potential target in grief therapy especially when aiming to reduce anxiety
Arousal	the bidirectional effect between momentary affective states and exercise duration on a day level despite the well documented positive effect of exercise on health outcomes most people do not succeed in exercising regularly in addition to several other influences affective states seem to support exercise participation associations between exercise and affect have been shown in the laboratory however the dynamic relation between affect and exercise in daily life is not yet well understood the objective of this study was to investigate the bi directional effect of momentary affective states on naturally occurring exercise and vice versa in healthy participants in real life environments by applying an ecological momentary assessment design we hypothesized that num exercise duration is positively associated with affective states on a day level num affective states in the morning predict subsequent exercise duration and num exercise duration predicts affective states in the evening on that respective day data from num students aged between num and num years were analyzed affect and exercise duration were assessed daily over a period of num days via an electronic diary multilevel analysis revealed that positive affective valence was positively associated with exercise duration p num num on a day level in addition the more the participants exercised that respective day the better and more content they felt in the evening p num num energetic arousal in the morning significantly predicted subsequent exercise duration p num num the findings indicate that it would be worthwhile to focus more on within subject analyses when analyzing the dynamic relation between affect and exercise furthermore affective states should be taken into account in creating effective interventions to foster exercise behavior and enhance maintenance
Acute_Threat_Fear	fear reduction in patients with chronic pain a learning theory perspective acute pain informs the individual that there is an imminent threat of body damage and is associated with the urge to escape and avoid fear learning takes place when neutral stimuli receive the propensity to predict the occurrence of pain and when defensive responses are initiated in anticipation of potential threats to the integrity of the body fear avoidance models have been put forward featuring the role of individual differences in catastrophic interpretations of pain in the modulation of learning and avoidance based on extensive literature on fear reduction in anxiety disorders cognitive behavioral treatments have been developed and applied to patients with chronic pain reporting substantial pain related fear in this article we discuss mechanisms underlying the acquisition the assessment and extinction of pain related fear through the cognitive behavioral treatment of pain related fear finally we provide a number of critical notes and directions for future research in the field of chronic pain and pain related fear
Acute_Threat_Fear	cortisol administration acutely reduces threat selective spatial attention in healthy young men there is mounting evidence that single administrations of glucocorticoids may acutely reduce human fear we previously reported that administration of cortisol acutely reduced non spatial selective attention to fearful faces and likewise reduced preferential processing of fearful faces in a spatial working memory task here we report the acute effects of num mg cortisol administered in a double blind placebo controlled crossover design on a different experimental task for measuring threat selective attention twenty healthy young males had to localize a target which was presented in a peripheral location that was either gazed at or not by a preceding dynamic happy or fearful face this reliable method has been used repeatedly to demonstrate fear driven selective attention present results showed that after placebo as usual the fearful gaze cues caused stronger orienting of attention than happy faces cortisol abolished this typical anxious response pattern but only in low anxious participants these data provide evidence that cortisol acutely influences also spatial threat selective attention possible neuroendocrine mechanisms are discussed
Sleep_Wakefulness	differential roles of orexin receptors in the regulation of sleep wakefulness orexin and orexin are hypothalamic neuropeptides that play critical roles in the regulation of sleep wakefulness as well as in a variety of physiological functions such as emotion reward and energy homeostasis the actions of orexins are mediated by two receptors orexin num and orexin num receptors and show partly overlapping but distinct distributions throughout the central nervous system suggesting their differential roles this review presents and discusses the current knowledge concerning the physiological roles of each orexin receptor subtype focusing on the regulation of sleep wakefulness
Sustained_Threat	extended amygdala connectivity changes during sustained shock anticipation the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and central amygdala cea of the extended amygdala are small anatomically interconnected brain regions they are thought to mediate responses to sustained unpredictable threat stimuli and phasic predictable threat stimuli respectively they perform these operations largely through their interconnected networks in two previous studies we mapped and contrasted the resting functional connectivity networks of the and cea at num tesla with high resolution this follow up study investigates the changes in functional connectivity of these structures during sustained anticipation of electric shock results show that the and cea become less strongly coupled with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex vmpfc cingulate and nucleus accumbens in shock threat relative to a safety condition in addition the cea becomes more strongly coupled with the thalamus under threat an exploratory whole brain connectivity analysis reveals that although the cea exhibits generally decreased connectivity many other cortical regions demonstrate greater coupling under threat than safety understanding the differential network structures of these two regions and how they contribute to processing under threat will help elucidate the building blocks of the anxious state
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	an integrative network approach to social anxiety disorder the complex dynamic interplay among attentional bias for threat attentional control and symptoms cognitive models posit that social anxiety disorder is associated with and maintained by biased attention allocation vis a vis social threat however over the last decade there has been intense debate regarding whether in results from preferential engagement with or difficulty in disengaging from social threat further recent evidence suggests that may merely result from top down attentional impairments vis a vis non emotional material consequently uncertainty still abounds regarding both the relative importance and the mutual interactions of these different processes and symptoms inspired by novel network approaches to psychopathology that conceptualize symptoms as complex dynamic systems of mutually interacting variables we computed weighted directed networks to investigate potential causal relations among laboratory measures of attentional components and symptoms of social anxiety disorder global and local connectivity of network structures revealed that the three most central variables were the orienting component of attention as well as both avoidance and fear of social situations neither preferential attention engagement with threat nor difficulty disengaging from threat exhibited high relative importance as predictors of symptoms in the network together these findings suggest the value of extending the network approach beyond self reported clinical symptoms to incorporate process level measures from laboratory tasks to gain new insight into the mechanisms of
Acute_Threat_Fear	can hospital form trigger fear response to examine whether exposure to curve versus sharp contours in the built healthcare setting produces systematic and identifiable patterns of amygdala activation and behavioral response in healthy adults recent studies in cognitive neuroscience suggest that humans prefer objects with a curved contour compared with objects that have pointed features and a sharp angled contour an implicit perception of threat represented by sharp objects in humans was hypothesized to explain this bias the study adopted a within subject experimental design where num subjects representing three age groups and both sexes were exposed to a randomized order of num real life images objects interiors exteriors landscape and a set of control images amygdala activation was simultaneously captured using functional magnetic resonance imaging technology subjects preference like dislike data were also collected while in the scanner data were collected in num in case of images depicting landscape and healthcare objects brain scans show significant higher amygdala activation associated with sharp contours however in relation to images depicting hospital interiors and exterior envelops brain scans show significant higher amygdala activation associated with curve contours these activations pertain to exposure during the precognitive stages of the subjects perception hospital forms do have systematic impact on fear response during precognitive stages of human perception whether this first impression colors the subsequent experience of an actual patient with real illness or injury is unknown
Arousal	affect contagion between mothers and infants examining valence and touch mothers and their babies represent one of the closest dyadic units and thus provide a powerful paradigm to examine how affective states are shared and result in synchronized physiologic responses between two people we recruited mothers and their num to num month old infants ndyads num to complete a lab study in which mothers were initially separated from their infants and assigned to either a low arousal positive relaxation condition intended to elicit parasympathetic nervous system reactivity or a high arousal negative stress task intended to elicit sympathetic nervous system reactivity upon reunion infants were placed either on their mothers laps touch condition or in a high chair next to the mother no touch condition we then examined if the babies and or responses changed from their baseline levels and how the dyads physiological responses both and responses synchronized over time as a function of mothers affect manipulation and touch condition three noteworthy findings were observed first infants of mothers assigned to the relaxation task showed greater increases and covariation second infants of mothers assigned to the stress task showed stronger covariation with their mothers over time finally infants who sat on their mothers laps i e touch condition showed stronger covariation than those in the no touch condition taken together these results suggest that mothers affective states low arousal positive states as well as high arousal negative states can be caught by their infants and that touch can play a critical role in stress contagion psycinfo database record
Acute_Threat_Fear	trauma exposure acutely alters neural function during pavlovian fear conditioning posttraumatic stress disorder is associated with dysfunction of the neural circuitry that supports fear learning and memory processes however much of what is known about neural dysfunction in is based on research in chronic populations less is known about neural function that supports fear learning acutely following trauma exposure determining the acute effects of trauma exposure on brain function would provide new insight into the neural processes that mediate the cognitive affective dysfunction associated with therefore the present study investigated neural activity that supports fear learning and memory processes in recently trauma exposed and non trauma exposed participants participants completed a pavlovian fear conditioning procedure during functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri during fmri participants threat expectancy was continuously monitored participants showed greater threat expectancy during warning than safety cues while no difference was observed in the group this finding suggests participants overgeneralized the fear association to the safety cue further only the group showed a negative relationship between fmri signal responses within dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and threat expectancy during safety cues these results suggest the dorsomedial mediates overgeneralization of learned fear as an acute result of trauma exposure finally neural activity within the and inferior parietal lobule showed a negative relationship with symptom severity assessed three months posttrauma thus neural activity measured acutely following trauma exposure predicted future symptom severity the present findings elucidate the acute effects of trauma exposure on cognitive affective function and provide new insight into the neural mechanisms of
Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	impact of state anxiety on the interaction between threat monitoring and cognition how does threat processing impact cognitive performance to investigate this question in the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study participants performed a response conflict task neutral congruent and incongruent trials that followed a variable length shock anticipation period or a corresponding delay during which they would not be shocked the delay period was cued by a geometric shaped stimulus indicating whether the subject was in the safe no shock or threat potential shock condition behaviorally participants showed increased reaction time interference incongruent neutral during threat trials an effect that increased as a function of state anxiety level across participants brain imaging data were analyzed for the cue and the subsequent target phase of the task at the target phase the left anterior insula exhibited interaction type responses i e increased interference during threat trials that were positively associated with state anxiety level a relationship that paralleled the behavioral pattern at the cue phase greater responses to threat vs safe were observed in a circuit of regions including the medial anterior insula thalamus and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis caudate which we interpreted as engaged by shock monitoring anticipation processes in contrast intriguingly greater responses to safe vs threat at the cue phase were observed in a broader set of regions that overlapped with the resting state network finally a standard statistical mediation analysis revealed that the relationship between state anxiety scores and interference related responses in the left anterior insula during the target phase was partially mediated via cue responses in the medial consistent with the idea that more anxious individuals had difficulty in engaging the medial during the threat condition taken together our findings suggest that threat monitoring impairs the upcoming resolution of interference furthermore a confluence of effects of cognitive task condition threat and individual differences in state anxiety was observed in the anterior insula a structure that is suggested to be particularly important for the interaction between emotion and cognition

Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	was not all that scary uncertainty and stressor appraisals predict anxiety related to a coming viral threat reached pandemic proportions in num yet considerable ambivalence was apparent concerning the threat presented and the inclination to be vaccinated the present investigation assessed several factors notably appraisals of the threat intolerance of uncertainty and familiarity with the virus that might contribute to reactions to a potential future viral threat canadian adults num provided with several scenarios regarding viral threats reported moderate feelings of anxiety irrespective of whether the viral threat was one that was familiar versus one that was entirely unfamiliar to them recurrence a fictitious virus participants appraised the stressfulness of the threats to be moderate and believed that they would have control in this situation however among individuals with high intolerance of uncertainty the viral threat was accompanied by high levels of anxiety which was mediated by aspects of appraisals particularly control and stressfulness in addition among those individuals that generally appraised ambiguous life events as being stressful the viral threat appraisals were accompanied by still greater anxiety given the limited response to potential viral threats these results raise concerns that the public may be hesitant to heed recommendations should another pandemic occur
Arousal	motivational general arousal imagery does not improve decision making performance in elite endurance cyclists emotions are predicted to influence judgement and decision making across a range of performance contexts this experiment tested whether motivational general arousal imagery can improve the decision making performance of elite endurance cyclists in total num cyclists num men num women were assigned to either a positive imagery condition where positive images associated with the affective experience of winning were encouraged or a negative imagery condition where negative images associated with poor performance were encouraged the cyclists were read one of two scripts designed to elicit positive or negative images during a num min maximal sustainable interval on a cycle ergometer decision making task colour word match stroop was performed before and immediately after the maximal sustainable power interval results showed that the manipulation was successful with cyclists in the positive imagery condition reporting more positive affective states higher levels of happiness and lower levels of dejection than those in the negative imagery condition however there was no significant difference between the two groups in their decision making performance under physiological duress these findings indicate that while motivational general arousal imagery might be a useful method to induce positive emotions during exercise it is unlikely to improve the decision making performance of cyclists in performance relevant conditions
Arousal	psychometric properties of the polish version of the job related affective well being scale the aim of this study was to verify psychometric properties of the polish version of the job related affective well being scale specifically theoretical num factor structure based on the dimensions of pleasure and arousal and reliability of the original num item van katwyk et al num and the shortened num item schaufeli and van rhenen num versions were tested two independent samples were analyzed police officers num and police recruits num the polish version of the original num item was used to measure job related affective states across the past month van katwyk et al num this version of includes num dimensions valence and arousal which allow to assess num categories of emotions low arousal positive emotions high arousal positive emotions low arousal negative emotions and high arousal negative emotions the results of multidimensional scaling analysis showed that the theoretical circumplex model of emotions underlining was satisfactorily reproduced also the hypothesized num factor structure of the polish version of was confirmed the num item version had better fit with the data than the original num item version but the best fit was obtained for the even shorter num item version this version emerged from a multidimensional scaling of the num item version reliabilities of the num and num item versions were good with lower values for the num item version the findings confirmed satisfactory psychometric properties of both polish versions of the job related affective well being scale thus when both psychometric properties and relevance for cross cultural comparisons are considered the num item is recommended as a version of choice
Sleep_Wakefulness	the changes in thermal preference sleep wakefulness body temperature and locomotor activity in the rats with medial septal lesion the effects of the destruction of the medial septal neurons with methyl d aspartic acid on sleep wakefulness body temperature tb locomotor activity and thermal preference were studied in male wistar rats when these rats were given a choice of three ambient temperatures tamb of num num and num degrees they preferred num degrees before the lesion but they chose num degrees during the initial days and num degrees by the third week after the lesion the lesion produced an increase in paradoxical sleep though this change was not very evident when the rats were not allowed to choose their tamb though there was a decrease in slow wave sleep it recovered considerably when the lesioned rats chose their preferred tamb however the frequency of episodes did not show any recovery there was a decrease in both tb and by the third week after the lesion it can therefore be concluded that the lesion affected the initiation of as there was a decrease in the frequency of episodes study of in the rats that were given freedom to select tamb helped to demonstrate the role of the in the inhibition of it also showed that the thermostat of the rats was reset at a lower level by the third week after the lesion decrease in heat production resulting from a decrease in could have contributed towards the animals efforts to maintain a lower tb
Arousal	prospective investigation of affect the desire to gamble gambling motivations and gambling behavior in the mood disorders time sampling methodology was implemented to examine the prospective associations between affect desire to gamble and gambling behavior in individuals diagnosed with a mood disorder thirty num male num female adults with a lifetime diagnosis of a depressive or bipolar disorder diagnosis who endorsed current gambling and lifetime gambling harm participated in the present study participants completed electronic diary entries of their current affective state desire to gamble and gambling behavior for num consecutive days hierarchical linear modelling revealed that affect was not a predictor of gambling behavior instead affect predicted the desire to gamble with high levels of sadness and arousal independently predicting an increased desire to gamble desire to gamble predicted actual gambling behavior there were no differences across diagnostic groups in terms of gambling motivations at baseline however during the num day period participants with bipolar disorder endorsed gambling to cope with negative affect more often than did participants with depressive disorder whereas those with depressive disorder more often endorsed gambling for social reasons or enhancement of positive affect the present findings provide evidence that negative affect is not directly related to actual gambling behavior and suggest that affective states rather impact the desire to gamble
Sleep_Wakefulness	effects of smoking exposure in infants on gastroesophageal reflux as a function of the sleep wakefulness state to determine whether perinatal smoking exposure is associated with gastroesophageal reflux related changes in sleep wakefulness states in neonates thirty one neonates referred for the investigation of suspected were recruited and underwent multichannel impedance ph monitoring and synchronized num to num hour polysomnography the infants exposure to tobacco smoke was estimated by means of a urine cotinine assay the total number frequency h num and mean duration minutes of ph reflux events detected by the ph electrode only and imp reflux events with bolus movement detected by impedance events were determined intergroup differences smoking exposed group vs nonexposed group were probed with nonparametric unpaired mann whitney tests chi num test was used to assess a possible intergroup difference in bolus retrograde migration during imp events according to the urine cotinine assay num of the num neonates had been exposed to cigarette smoke during the perinatal period the number and frequency of imp was significantly greater num in the exposed group num num num than in the nonexposed group num num num migration of the esophageal bolus from the distal segment to the most proximal segment was significantly more frequent num in the exposed group num of than in the nonexposed group num the pattern associated with smoking exposure was particularly obvious during rapid eye movement sleep the more frequent occurrence and greater proximal migration of imp in the smoking exposed group especially during rapid eye movement sleep may have clinical relevance smoking exposure is a preventable risk factor for limiting the occurrence of in neonates
Frustrative_Nonreward	interplay of normative beliefs and behavior in developmental patterns of physical and relational aggression in adolescence a four wave longitudinal study in a longitudinal study with num num adolescents from germany we investigated patterns of change and gender differences in physical and relational aggression in relation to normative beliefs about these two forms of aggression participants whose mean age was num years at completed self report measures of physically and relationally aggressive behavior and indicated their normative approval of both forms of aggression at four data waves separated by num month intervals boys scored higher than did girls on both forms of aggression but the gender difference was more pronounced for physical aggression physical aggression decreased and relational aggression increased over the four data waves in both gender groups the normative acceptance of both forms of aggression decreased over time with a greater decrease for the approval of physical aggression in both gender groups normative approval of relational aggression prospectively predicted relational aggression across all data waves and the normative approval of physical aggression predicted physically aggressive behavior at the second and third data waves reciprocal reinforcement of aggressive norms and behavior was found for both forms of aggression the findings are discussed as supporting a social information processing perspective on developmental patterns of change in physical and relational aggression in adolescence

Sustained_Threat	healthy individuals maintain adaptive stimulus evaluation under predictable and unpredictable threat the anxiety inducing paradigms such as the threat of shock paradigm have provided ample data on the emotional processing of predictable and unpredictable threat but little is known about the processing of aversive threat irrelevant stimuli in these paradigms we investigated how the predictability of threat influences the neural visual processing of threat irrelevant fearful and neutral faces thirty two healthy individuals participated in an threat test consisting of a safe or neutral condition and a predictable as well as an unpredictable threat condition using audio visual threat stimuli in all conditions we registered participants brain responses to threat irrelevant faces via magnetoencephalography the data showed that increasing unpredictability of threat evoked increasing emotion regulation during face processing predominantly in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex regions during an early to mid latency time interval importantly we obtained only main effects but no significant interaction of facial expression and conditions of different threat predictability neither in behavioral nor in neural data healthy individuals with average trait anxiety are thus able to maintain adaptive stimulus evaluation processes under predictable and unpredictable threat conditions
Arousal	multivariate pattern classification reveals autonomic and experiential representations of discrete emotions defining the structural organization of emotions is a central unresolved question in affective science in particular the extent to which autonomic nervous system activity signifies distinct affective states remains controversial most prior research on this topic has used univariate statistical approaches in attempts to classify emotions from psychophysiological data in the present study electrodermal cardiac respiratory and gastric activity as well as self report measures were taken from healthy subjects during the experience of fear anger sadness surprise contentment and amusement in response to film and music clips information pertaining to affective states present in these response patterns was analyzed using multivariate pattern classification techniques overall accuracy for classifying distinct affective states was num num for autonomic measures and num num for self report measures both of which were significantly above chance further examining the error distribution of classifiers revealed that the dimensions of valence and arousal selectively contributed to decoding emotional states from self report whereas a categorical configuration of affective space was evident in both self report and autonomic measures taken together these findings extend recent multivariate approaches to study emotion and indicate that pattern classification tools may improve upon univariate approaches to reveal the underlying structure of emotional experience and physiological expression
Acute_Threat_Fear	overt behavior and ultrasonic vocalization in a fear conditioning paradigm a dose response study in the rat the behavioral analysis of laboratory rats is usually confined to the level of overt behavior like locomotion behavioral inhibition instrumental responses and others apart from such visible outcome however behaviorally relevant information can also be obtained when analyzing the animals ultrasonic vocalization which is typically emitted in highly motivational situations like num khz calls in response to acute or conditioned threat to further investigate such vocalizations and their relationship with overt behavior we tested male wistar rats in a paradigm of pavlovian fear conditioning where a tone stimulus was preceding an aversive foot shock in a distinct environment importantly the shock dose was varied between groups num num num ma and its acute and conditioned outcome were determined the analysis of visible behavior confirms the usefulness of immobility as a measure of fear conditioning especially when higher shock doses were used rearing and grooming on the other hand were more useful to detect conditioned effects with lower shock levels ultrasonic vocalization occurred less consistently than changes in overt behavior however dose response relationships were also observed during the phase of conditioning for example in latency call rate and lengths intervals between calls and sound amplitude furthermore total calling time and rate were highly correlated with overt behavior namely behavioral inhibition as measured through immobility these correlations were observed during the phase of fear conditioning and the subsequent tests importantly conditioned effects in overt behavior were observed both to the context and to the presented in this context whereas conditioned vocalization to the context was not observed except for one rat in support and extent of previous results the present data show that a detailed analysis of ultrasonic vocalization can substantially broaden and refine the spectrum of analysis in behavioral work with rats since it can provide information about situational state and subject dependent factors which are partly distinct from what is visible to the experimenter

Potential_Threat_Anxiety_	maternal anxiety predicts attentional bias towards threat in infancy although cognitive theories of psychopathology suggest that attention bias toward threat plays a role in the etiology and maintenance of anxiety there is relatively little evidence regarding individual differences in the earliest development of attention bias toward threat the current study examines attention bias toward threat during its potential first emergence by evaluating the relations between attention bias and known risk factors of anxiety i e temperamental negative affect and maternal anxiety we measured attention bias to emotional faces in infants num num male ages num to num months during an attention disengagement eye tracking paradigm we hypothesized that a there would be an attentional bias toward threat in the full sample of infants replicating previous studies b attentional bias toward threat would be positively related to maternal anxiety and c attention bias toward threat would be positively related to temperamental negative affect finally d we explored the potential interaction between temperament and maternal anxiety in predicting attention bias toward threat we found that attention bias to the affective faces did not change with age and that bias was not related to temperament however attention bias to threat but not attention bias to happy faces was positively related to maternal anxiety such that higher maternal anxiety predicted a larger attention bias for all infants these findings provide support for attention bias as a putative early mechanism by which early markers of risk are associated with socioemotional development psycinfo database record
Circadian_Rhythms	circadian rhythm sleep wake disorders the endogenous circadian rhythms are one of the cardinal processes that control sleep they are self sustaining biological rhythms with a periodicity of approximately num hours that may be entrained by external zeitgebers german for time givers such as light exercise and meal times this article discusses the physiology of the circadian rhythms their relationship to neurologic disease and the presentation and treatment of circadian rhythm sleep wake disorders classic examples of circadian rhythms include cortisol and melatonin secretion body temperature and urine volume more recently the impact of circadian rhythm on several neurologic disorders has been investigated such as the timing of occurrence of epileptic seizures as well as neurobehavioral functioning in dementia further updates include a more in depth understanding of the symptoms consequences and treatment of circadian sleep wake disorders which may occur because of extrinsic misalignment with clock time or because of intrinsic dysfunction of the brain an example of extrinsic misalignment occurs with jet lag during transmeridian travel or with intrinsic circadian rhythm sleep wake disorders such as advanced or delayed sleep wake phase disorders in advanced sleep wake phase disorder which is most common in elderly individuals sleep onset and morning arousal are undesirably early leading to impaired evening function with excessive sleepiness and sleep maintenance insomnia with early morning awakening by contrast delayed sleep wake phase disorder is characterized by an inability to initiate sleep before the early morning hours with subsequent delayed rise time leading to clinical symptoms of severe sleep onset insomnia coupled with excessive daytime sleepiness in the morning hours as patients are unable to sleep in to attain sufficient sleep quantity irregular sleep wake rhythm disorder is misentrainment with patches of brief sleep and wakefulness spread throughout the day leading to unstable sleep and waking behavioral patterns and an entirely idiosyncratic sleep wake schedule familiarity with these major circadian rhythm sleep wake disorder phenotypes and their overlap with other neurologic disorders is essential for the neurologist so that clinicians may intervene and improve patient functioning and quality of life
Acute_Threat_Fear	global and situational relationship satisfaction moderate the effect of threat on pain in couples the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that greater global and situational relationship satisfaction would reduce the negative impact of threatening information on acute pain an experimental design was used to manipulate threat and elicit acute pain via a cold pressor task the study was completed in a research laboratory at a large urban university in the midwestern participants were num couples in which at least one individual was an undergraduate student after administration of a global relationship satisfaction measure couples were randomly assigned to either receive high or low threatening information about the painful task following the threat manipulation couples discussed the upcoming task and rated their satisfaction with the interaction i e situational relationship satisfaction the designated pain participant then completed the painful task alone the threat manipulation altered couples perceived threat of pain situational relationship satisfaction moderated the effect of threat on pain trajectories such that situational relationship satisfaction predicted less pain intensity at an earlier point in the task for the low threat condition than the high threat condition greater global relationship satisfaction predicted greater likelihood of task completion among those in the low threat condition whereas it was unrelated to task completion in the high threat condition greater global relationship satisfaction also predicted lower pain intensity throughout the task these findings demonstrate that the interpersonal context is independently related to acute pain and may also alter the effect of threatening information on acute pain

Arousal	dissociable effects of valence and arousal in adaptive executive control based on introspectionist semantic and psychophysiological experimental frameworks it has long been assumed that all affective states derive from two independent basic dimensions valence and arousal however until now no study has investigated whether valence and arousal are also dissociable at the level of affect related changes in cognitive processing we examined how changes in both valence negative vs positive and arousal low vs high influence performance in tasks requiring executive control because recent research indicates that two dissociable cognitive components are involved in the regulation of task performance amount of current control i e strength of filtering goal irrelevant signals and control adaptation i e strength of maintaining current goals over time using a visual pop out distractor task we found that control is exclusively modulated by arousal because interference by goal irrelevant signals was largest in high arousal states independently of valence by contrast control adaptation is exclusively modulated by valence because the increase in control after trials in which goal irrelevant signals were present was largest in negative states independent of arousal monte carlo simulation revealed that differential effects of two experimental factors on control and control adaptation can be dissociated if there is no correlation between empirical interference and conflict driven modulation of interference which was the case in the present data consequently the observed effects of valence and arousal on adaptive executive control are indeed dissociable these findings indicate that affective influences on cognitive processes can be driven by independent effects of variations in valence and arousal which may resolve several heterogeneous findings observed in previous studies on affect cognition interactions

Frustrative_Nonreward	the role of teacher behavior in children s relational aggression development five wave longitudinal study the present article examined the development of relational aggression in middle childhood and the effects of observed teacher behavior on this development relying on social learning theory we expected that teacher praise would slow down the increase of relational aggression whereas teacher reprimands would promote the increase of relational aggression sample of num children num boys mage years and months num belgian was followed from second to fourth grade teacher praise and reprimands were observed at the beginning of second grade child relational aggression was assessed using teacher and peer reports collected at five points in time at the beginning and end of the second grade at the beginning and end of the third grade and at the end of the fourth grade multilevel modeling showed that relational aggression generally increased from second to fourth grade moreover when teachers displayed more praise students relational aggression increased at a slower rate when teachers displayed more reprimands students relational aggression increased at a faster rate overall the results stress the importance of supporting teachers to reduce reprimands and increase praise when interacting with children
Frustrative_Nonreward	the co development of relational aggression and disruptive behavior symptoms from late childhood through adolescence researchers have debated whether relational aggression is a developmentally normative behavior or a sign of some underlying psychopathology however due to the dearth of longitudinal studies we know little about how relational aggression and more severe forms of disruptive behavior co develop the present study examined bidirectional associations between relational aggression and two psychiatric disorders oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder using data from a longitudinal study of num mexican origin youth followed from age num to num results showed that individuals who engaged in relational aggression tended to increase over time in and symptoms and conversely individuals exhibiting symptoms of and tended to increase in relational aggression these findings held for boys and girls for youth born in mexico and the and after controlling for physical aggression thus relational aggression seems to be both a developmentally normative behavior and a predictor of future mental health problems

Sleep_Wakefulness	effectiveness of hammock positioning in reducing pain and improving sleep wakefulness state in preterm infants hammock positioning is now frequently used with preterm infants admitted to icus however few studies have investigated the extent to which hammock positioning reduces pain and improves the sleep wakefulness state compared with traditional positioning twenty six clinically stable newborns with gestational ages from num to num weeks who were breathing spontaneously were randomly assigned to num groups a hammock positioning group n num in which newborns were placed in hammocks in the lateral position and a traditional positioning group n num in which they were kept nested also in the lateral position the following variables were evaluated at the beginning and the end of the treatment pain with the premature infant pain profile and neonatal facial coding system sleep wakefulness state with the brazelton neonatal behavioral assessment scale heart rate breathing frequency and peripheral spo the subjects in the hammock positioning group showed an improvement in pain compared with the traditional positioning group premature infant pain profile score num num num num vs num num num num deltap num and sleep wakefulness state score num num num num vs num num num num delta num reduced heart rate num num num num vs num num num num beats min delta num breathing frequency num num num num vs num num num num beats min delta num and increased peripheral spo num num num num vs num num num num delta num hammock positioning was an effective treatment option to reduce pain and improve sleep wakefulness state it also helped to reduce heart rate and breathing frequency and to increase peripheral spo which made it a treatment option for preterm infants
Sustained_Threat	attention to threat in posttraumatic stress disorder as indexed by eye tracking indices a systematic review cognitive models of posttraumatic stress disorder implicate threat related attentional biases in the etiology and phenomenology of the disorder however extant attentional research using reaction time based paradigms and measures has yielded mixed results eye tracking methodology has emerged in recent years to overcome several inherent drawbacks of based tasks striving to better delineate attentional processes systematic review of experimental studies examining threat related attention biases in using eye tracking methodology and group comparison designs was conducted conforming to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses guidelines studies were selected following a systematic search for publications between num and december num in psycinfo and the national center for research s published international literature on traumatic stress database additional records were identified by employing the similar articles feature in pubmed and the cited reference search in web of science reference sections of review articles book chapters and studies selected for inclusion were searched for further studies ongoing studies were also sought through clinicaltrials gov total of num studies n num participants in total were included in the final review results indicated little support for enhanced threat detection hypervigilance and attentional avoidance however consistent evidence emerged for sustained attention on threat i e attention maintenance in this review is the first to systematically evaluate extant findings in emanating from eye tracking studies employing group comparison designs results suggest that sustained attention on threat might serve as a potential target for therapeutic intervention
Sleep_Wakefulness	neural immune interactions in disorders of sleep wakefulness organization novel findings on the effects of inflammatory molecules on neuronal circuits and on molecular interactions between immunity and sleep in health and disease shed light on the pathogenesis of disorders of past encephalitis lethargica and present concern human african trypanosomiasis and narcolepsy which share alterations in sleep wakefulness transitions although these three disorders differ in etiology synaptic interactions with immune response derived molecules could play a pathogenetic role knowledge obtained on neural immune interplay during senescence also has implications for age related sleep dysregulation which is common in the elderly population altogether the data indicate that cell groups implicated in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness circadian timing and their interactions could be sensitive to synaptic effects of immune molecules

Acute_Threat_Fear	anticipatory prefrontal cortex activity underlies stress induced changes in pavlovian fear conditioning excessive stress exposure often leads to emotional dysfunction characterized by disruptions in healthy emotional learning expression and regulation processes prefrontal cortex amygdala circuit appears to underlie these important emotional processes however limited human neuroimaging research has investigated whether these brain regions underlie the altered emotional function that develops with stress therefore the present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri to investigate stress induced changes in amygdala function during pavlovian fear conditioning participants completed a variant of the montreal imaging stress task followed min later by a pavlovian fear conditioning task during fmri self reported stress to the was used to identify three stress reactivity groups low medium and high psychophysiological behavioral and fmri signal responses were compared between the three stress reactivity groups during fear conditioning fear learning indexed via participant expectation of the unconditioned stimulus during conditioning increased with stress reactivity further the high stress reactivity group demonstrated greater autonomic arousal i e skin conductance response to both conditioned and unconditioned stimuli compared to the low and medium stress reactivity groups finally the high stress group did not regulate the emotional response to threat more specifically the high stress reactivity group did not show a negative relationship between conditioned and unconditioned scrs stress induced changes in these emotional processes paralleled changes in dorsolateral dorsomedial and ventromedial function these findings demonstrate that acute stress facilitates fear learning enhances autonomic arousal and impairs emotion regulation and suggests these stress induced changes in emotional function are mediated by the
Arousal	measuring positive emotions in cows do visible eye whites tell us anything insight into the emotional lives of animals is of utmost importance to the welfare of the billions of animals in our care yet little is known about how to measure these states scientific understanding of how to measure and interpret positive emotional states is particularly lacking although recent years have seen a notable increase in such studies this study explored whether the percentage of visible eye whites is a valid measure of a low arousal positive emotional state in dairy cows bos taurus by using stroking as the positive stimulus thirteen dairy cows were studied over a period of two months and a total of num full minute focal observations were performed each focal observation comprised three minute phases pre stroking baseline stroking stimulus and post stroking post stimulus and the focal cow s behaviours were recorded throughout each observation and the focal eye was filmed for later analysis following data collection we calculated the percentage of visible eye white at nine pre determined measurement points throughout each focal observation the eye white data were analysed using the one way repeated measures test the percentage of visible eye white dropped during stroking compared with during both the pre stroking and post stroking phases num num num num num num num the behaviours were analysed using friedman s and wilcoxon s signed rank test behaviours known to be associated with positive emotions in cows were performed during the stroking phase of the focal observation supporting the use of stroking as a stimulus to induce a positive low arousal emotional state this study has explored the potential of visible eye whites as a measure of positive emotions and arousal and our results support previous studies which suggest that eye whites may serve as a dynamic measure of emotion and arousal

Sustained_Threat	vigilance for threat interacts with amygdala responses to subliminal threat cues in specific phobia the amygdala has been strongly implicated in the processing of threat relevant information in specific phobia however there is an ongoing debate as to whether the amygdala may also be engaged outside of conscious stimulus awareness furthermore considering that sustained vigilance for threat constitutes a crucial characteristic of specific phobias we hypothesized a possible role of this symptom in modulating amygdala sensitivity to disorder relevant cues using event related functional magnetic resonance imaging we examined responses of the amygdala to subliminal and supraliminal phobogenic stimuli in spider phobic subjects and whether these responses might be specifically associated with disorder related hypervigilance eighteen female spider phobic subjects and num healthy female control subjects were exposed to pictures of spiders and phobia irrelevant objects presented briefly during two backward masking conditions used to manipulate stimulus awareness brain activation data were analyzed as a function of subjects perceptual performance on each single trial and were tested for correlations with different components of the phobic symptomatology such as vigilance as assessed by self report scales compared with control subjects phobic participants showed stronger responses of both amygdalae to consciously perceived spiders versus nonspider targets whereas during unconscious stimulus processing enhanced activation was only apparent in the right amygdala moreover the intensity of disorder related vigilance was positively correlated with right amygdala activation specifically during the subliminal condition these findings provide evidence for unconscious threat processing in specific phobia with the magnitude of amygdala responses specifically potentiated by sustained hypervigilance for threat aberrations in this vigilance system may be critically involved in anxiety disorders

Sleep_Wakefulness	correlation of premature infant sleep wakefulness and noise levels in the presence or absence of quiet time peak sound levels during sleep can compromise the development of hospitalized infants quiet time is a strategy implemented in neonatal units to promote the sleeping of neonates by reducing noise levels luminosity and handling during particular periods of the day to determine the impact of quiet time on reducing sound levels and increasing total sleep time this longitudinal study was conducted at a neonatal intermediate care unit with a convenience sample of num premature infants four times per day num minute quiet times were provided in the neonatal unit sleep awake states and sound levels were evaluated during quiet times as well as num minutes before and afterward polysomnography was used for sleep awake state assessment and a noise dosimeter was used to check sound levels every num hours the preterm infants had a corrected gestational age of num num num num weeks and weighed num num num num g total sleep time was highest during quiet time num premature infants remained awake for longer following quiet times num there was also a reduction in sound level during quiet times compared with the other time frames num no statistically significant relationship was found between total sleep time and sound levels more than num hours quiet time is a nursing intervention that should be implemented in all neonatal units future research should use a greater sample size and other factors that influence sleep should be further investigated
Arousal	pupil size changes as an active information channel for biofeedback applications pupil size is usually regarded as a passive information channel that provides insight into cognitive and affective states but defies any further control however in a recent study ehlers et al num we demonstrate that sympathetic activity indexed by pupil dynamics allows strategic interference by means of simple cognitive techniques utilizing positive negative imaginings subjects were able to expand pupil diameter beyond baseline variations albeit with varying degrees of success and only over brief periods the current study provides a comprehensive replication on the basis of considerable changes to the experimental set up results show that stricter methodological conditions controlled baseline settings and specified user instructions strengthen the reported effect whereas overall performance increases by one standard deviation effects are thereby not restricted to pupillary level parallel recordings of skin conductance changes prove a general enhancement of induced autonomic arousal considering the stability of the results across studies we conclude that pupil size information exceeds affective monitoring and may constitute an active input channel in human computer interaction furthermore since variations in pupil diameter reliably display self induced changes in sympathetic arousal the relevance of this parameter is strongly indicated for future approaches in clinical biofeedback
Circadian_Rhythms	interacting influences of aging and alzheimer s disease on circadian rhythms aging leads to changes in circadian rhythms including decreased amplitude or robustness altered synchrony with the environment and reduced coordination of rhythms within body these circadian rhythm alterations are more pronounced in age associated neurodegenerative disorders such as alzheimer s disease in which they often precede the onset of other symptoms by many years as well as their early onset the findings that fragmentation of daily rest activity rhythms in non demented older subjects is associated earlier cognitive decline increased risk of incident and preclinical neuropathology suggest that circadian rhythm disruption may contribute to the development and progression of the neuropathological changes occurring in conversely other studies have implicated amyloid beta a prominent neurotoxin that accumulates in in the impairment of circadian rhythms thus circadian rhythm disruption and associated neurodegeneration may interact to form a deleterious cycle this article reviews the neural and molecular mechanisms underlying the age and related changes in circadian rhythms it also explores therapeutic strategies proposed to ameliorate circadian rhythm deficits in elderly and demented individuals
Arousal	identifying core affect in individuals from fmri responses to dynamic naturalistic audiovisual stimuli recent research has demonstrated that affective states elicited by viewing pictures varying in valence and arousal are identifiable from whole brain activation patterns observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri identification of affective states from more naturalistic stimuli has clinical relevance but the feasibility of identifying these states on an individual trial basis from fmri data elicited by dynamic multimodal stimuli is unclear the goal of this study was to determine whether affective states can be similarly identified when participants view dynamic naturalistic audiovisual stimuli eleven participants viewed s audiovisual clips in a passive viewing task in the scanner valence and arousal for individual trials were identified both within and across participants based on distributed patterns of activity in areas selectively responsive to audiovisual naturalistic stimuli while controlling for lower level features of the stimuli in addition the brain regions identified by searchlight analyses to represent valence and arousal were consistent with previously identified regions associated with emotion processing these findings extend previous results on the distributed representation of affect to multimodal dynamic stimuli
Sustained_Threat	initial and sustained brain responses to threat anticipation in blood injection injury phobia blood injection injury phobia differs from other subtypes of specific phobia in that it is associated with elevated disgust sensitivity as well as specific autonomic and brain responses during processing of phobia relevant stimuli to what extent these features play a role already during threat anticipation is unclear in the current fmri experiment num female phobics and num female healthy controls anticipated the presentation of phobia specific and neutral pictures on the behavioral level anxiety dominated the anticipatory period in phobics relative to controls while both anxiety and disgust were elevated during picture presentation by applying two different models for the analysis of brain responses to anticipation of phobia specific versus neutral stimuli we found initial and sustained increases of activation in anterior cingulate cortex insula lateral and medial prefrontal cortex thalamus and visual areas as well as initial activation in the amygdala for phobics as compared to healthy controls these results suggest that phobia is characterized by activation of a typical neural defense network during threat anticipation with anxiety as the predominant emotion
Frustrative_Nonreward	physical and relational aggression as predictors of drug use gender differences among high school students the present study investigated the longitudinal relationships between physical and relational aggression and later drug use as moderated by gender self reported data were gathered from num high school students at pretest and num year post test to test the hypotheses that num males would engage in more physical aggression than females whereas females would engage in more relational aggression than males and num physical aggression would be a stronger drug use predictor for males and relational aggression a stronger predictor for females results indicated that males reported engaging in more physical aggression than females at baseline however females and males reported engaging in similar rates of relational aggression after controlling for relational aggression baseline drug use and demographic variables physical aggression at baseline was found to predict alcohol use num year later for males but not for females after controlling for physical aggression baseline drug use and demographic variables relational aggression was found to predict cigarette use and marijuana use for females but not for males however relational aggression was found to predict later alcohol and hard drug equally across gender these findings suggest that both physical and relational aggression are predictive of subsequent drug use and have important implications for violence and drug use prevention intervention efforts
Circadian_Rhythms	disinhibition of the extracellular signal regulated kinase restores the amplification of circadian rhythms by lithium in cells from bipolar disorder patients bipolar disorder is characterized by depression mania and circadian rhythm abnormalities lithium a treatment for stabilizes mood and increases circadian rhythm amplitude however in fibroblasts grown from patients lithium has weak effects on rhythm amplitude compared to healthy controls to understand the mechanism by which lithium differentially affects rhythm amplitude in cells we investigated the extracellular signal regulated kinase and related signaling molecules linked to and circadian rhythms in fibroblasts from patients controls and mice we assessed the contribution of the pathway to lithium induced circadian rhythm amplification protein analyses revealed low phospho num p content in fibroblasts from patients vs pharmacological inhibition of num by attenuated the rhythm amplification effect of lithium while inhibition of two related kinases c jun terminal kinase and did not knockdown of the transcription factors and num downstream effectors of num reduced baseline rhythm amplitude but did not alter rhythm amplification by lithium in contrast num knockdown amplified rhythms an effect that was not increased further by the addition of lithium suggesting this transcription factor may regulate the effect of lithium on amplitude augmentation of num signaling through knockdown sensitized cells to rhythm amplification by lithium in fibroblasts knockdown reversed the rhythm phenotype restoring the ability of lithium to increase amplitude in these cells we conclude that the inability of lithium to regulate circadian rhythms in may reflect reduced activity and signaling through num
Arousal	multiple output support vector machine regression with feature selection for arousal valence space emotion assessment human emotion recognition allows the assessment of an affective state of a subject until recently such emotional states were described in terms of discrete emotions like happiness or contempt in order to cover a high range of emotions researchers in the field have introduced different dimensional spaces for emotion description that allow the characterization of affective states in terms of several variables or dimensions that measure distinct aspects of the emotion one of the most common of such dimensional spaces is the bidimensional arousal valence space to the best of our knowledge all systems so far have modelled independently the dimensions in these dimensional spaces in this paper we study the effect of modelling the output dimensions simultaneously and show experimentally the advantages in modeling them in this way we consider a multimodal approach by including features from the electroencephalogram and a few physiological signals for modelling the multiple outputs we employ a multiple output regressor based on support vector machines we also include an stage of feature selection that is developed within an embedded approach known as recursive feature elimination proposed initially for the results show that several features can be eliminated using the multiple output support vector regressor with without affecting the performance of the regressor from the analysis of the features selected in smaller subsets via it can be observed that the signals that are more informative into the arousal and valence space discrimination are the electrooculogram electromiogram and the galvanic skin response
Loss	rumination and implicit avoidance following bereavement an approach avoidance task investigation rumination a risk factor in adjustment to bereavement has often been considered a confrontation process however building on research on worry in generalized anxiety disorder and rumination in post traumatic stress disorder researchers recently developed the rumination as avoidance hypothesis which states that rumination after bereavement serves to avoid the reality of the loss in the present study was tested by investigating if rumination is associated with implicit loss avoidance an approach avoidance task was used to assess automatic behavior tendencies using a joystick num persons who recently lost a first degree relative num num women pulled stimuli toward themselves or pushed them away from themselves stimuli represented the loss picture deceased loss word were loss related but ambiguous picture deceased neutral word picture stranger loss word or were non loss related picture stranger neutral word puzzle picture s participants who ruminated more were relatively faster in pushing loss stimuli away from themselves and slower in pulling loss stimuli towards themselves implying more rumination was associated with stronger implicit loss avoidance effects were maintained after controlling for depressive or post traumatic stress symptom levels but not when controlling for prolonged grief symptom levels conjugally bereaved women were overrepresented in the sample which limits generalizability of results the study was correlational precluding causal inferences in line with rumination was positively associated with loss avoidance this may indicate that the application of exposure based techniques can reduce rumination and loss related psychopathology
Frustrative_Nonreward	baseline autonomic nervous system arousal and physical and relational aggression in preschool the moderating role of effortful control the current study investigates whether established associations between physical aggression and low autonomic nervous system arousal as indexed by heart rate and blood pressure also apply to the study of the development of relational aggression baseline heart rate and blood pressure were collected in two samples of preschoolers and teachers reported on classroom physical and relational aggression in study num lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure were related to increased engagement in relational aggression among older preschoolers in study num lower heart rate and blood pressure predicted increased engagement in classroom physical and relational aggression concurrently and across a preschool year in some cases low baseline arousal aggression associations were strongest for children with poorer self regulation abilities whereas high self regulation appeared to protect children with low heart rate and blood pressure from engagement in aggressive classroom behavior these findings suggest the utility of examining baseline physiological measures in the study of relational aggression as well as physical aggression implications for interventions targeted to physical and relational aggression in early childhood are discussed
Circadian_Rhythms	the genetics of circadian rhythms sleep and health circadian rhythms are num h rhythms in physiology and behaviour generated by molecular clocks which serve to coordinate internal time with the external world the circadian system is a master regulator of nearly all physiology and its disruption has major consequences on health sleep and circadian rhythm disruption is a ubiquitous feature in today s num num society and studies on shift workers have shown that can lead not only to cognitive impairment but also metabolic syndrome and psychiatric illness including depression num num mouse models of clock mutants recapitulate these deficits implicating mechanistic and causal links between and disease pathophysiology num num importantly treating clock disruption reverses and attenuates these adverse health states in animal models num num thus establishing the circadian system as a novel therapeutic target significantly circadian and clock controlled gene mutations have recently been identified by genome wide association studies in the aetiology of sleep mental health and metabolic disorders this review will focus upon the genetics of circadian rhythms in sleep and health
Acute_Threat_Fear	stress promotes generalization of older but not recent threat memories stress broadly affects the ability to regulate emotions and may contribute to generalization of threat related behaviors to harmless stimuli behavioral generalization also tends to increase over time as memory precision for recent events gives way to more gist like representations thus acute stress coupled with a delay in time from a negative experience may be a strong predictor of the transition from normal to generalized fear expression here we investigated the effect of a single episode acute stressor on generalization of aversive learning when stress is administered either immediately after an aversive learning event or following a delay in a between subjects design healthy adult volunteers underwent threat fear conditioning using a tone conditioned stimulus paired with an electric shock to the wrist and another tone not paired with shock behavioral generalization was tested to a range of novel tones either on the same day experiment num or num h later experiment num and was preceded by either an acute stress induction or a control task anticipatory sympathetic arousal i e skin conductance responses scrs and explicit measures of shock expectancy served as dependent measures stress administered shortly after threat conditioning did not affect behavioral generalization in contrast stress administered following a delay led to heightened arousal and increased generalization of scrs and explicit measures of shock expectancy these findings show that acute stress increases generalization of older but not recent threat memories and have clinical relevance to understanding overgeneralization characteristics of anxiety and stress related disorders
Frustrative_Nonreward	relational aggression victimization and self concept testing pathways from middle childhood to adolescence when studying adolescent development it is important to consider two key areas that are salient for teens which are self concept and peer relations secondary analysis of the national institute of health and human development study of early child care and youth development was conducted to examine the prospective bidirectional associations between self concept and peer relations to date how social development broadly and peer relations in particular e g relational aggression and victimization affect self concept domains is not fully understood using a large sample num num girls num num years num with multiple informants the present study examined whether fifth grade relational aggression and sixth grade relational victimization was associated with adolescent self concept in three key domains i e academic sports physical appearance significant direct effect emerged such that relational aggression in middle childhood was associated with decreases in academic self concept and increases in sports self concept in adolescence analyses also revealed that having higher levels of domain specific self concept led to decreases in relational aggression across the transition to adolescence the findings highlight the importance of examining bidirectional prospective associations between relational aggression relational victimization and domain specific self concept implications for future research and clinical intervention are discussed
Circadian_Rhythms	signaling pathway and autophagy are involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms in behavior and plasticity of interneurons in the brain of drosophila melanogaster drosophila melanogaster is a common model used to study circadian rhythms in behavior and circadian clocks however numerous circadian rhythms have also been detected in non clock neurons especially in the first optic neuropil lamina of the fly s visual system such rhythms have been observed in the number of synapses and in the structure of interneurons which exhibit changes in size and shape in a circadian manner although the patterns of these changes are known the mechanism remains unclear in the present study we investigated the role of the signaling pathway and autophagy in regulating circadian rhythms based on the behavior and structural plasticity of the lamina monopolar cell dendritic trees in addition we examined the cyclic expression of the signaling pathway tor pik class num akt and autophagy atg and atg genes in the fly s brain we observed that tor atg and atg exhibit rhythmic expressions in the brain of wild type flies in day night conditions num num that are abolished in per clock mutants the silencing of tor in per expressing cells shortens a period of the locomotor activity rhythm of flies in addition silencing of the tor and atg genes in cells disrupts the circadian plasticity of the cell dendritic trees measured in the distal lamina in turn silencing of the atg gene in cells changes the pattern of this rhythm our results indicate that the signaling pathway and autophagy are involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms in the behavior and plasticity of neurons in the brain of adult flies
Loss	how does thought suppression impact upon beliefs about uncontrollability of worry according to wells metacognitive model of generalised anxiety disorder wells num meta cognition and worry cognitive model of generalised anxiety disorder behavioural and cognitive psychotherapy num num num patients attempt to suppress intrusions that trigger worry wells postulates that these attempts are rarely effective and may increase the frequency of worry triggers these apparent failures are interpreted as evidence for loss of mental control thereby exacerbating beliefs about worry uncontrollability the current study tested these predictions sixty two high worriers completed a naturalistic experiment comprising two sessions separated by num week in session num participants recorded their beliefs about worry in general including its uncontrollability they then selected a current worry and recorded how often it came to mind over the following week the suppression group num suppressed their chosen worry during the week the mention group num simply monitored its occurrence in session num session num measures were repeated contrary to prediction the suppression group reported a significant increase in worry controllability in general no shift was demonstrated by the mention group in addition relative to the mention group the suppression group reported more success at suppressing their chosen worries spent less time thinking about them and found them more controllable and less distressing findings are discussed within the context of wells model
Frustrative_Nonreward	the role of the school environment in relational aggression and victimization research conducted over the last decade has documented both the high rates of and serious consequences associated with both victimization and perpetration of relational aggression this study examines risk for involvement in relational aggression and victimization among middle school youth evaluating both individual beliefs about violence as well as aspects of the school environment including interpersonal school climate and school responsiveness to violence sample of num num primarily urban minority middle school youth num num female participating in a violence prevention project completed measures of relational aggression and victimization as well as indicators of individual beliefs about aggression school norms for aggression student teacher and student student interpersonal climate and school responsiveness to violence unlike results previously found for physical aggression no school level indicator of climate was related to relational aggression or victimization however individual beliefs about aggression and individual perceptions of the school environment were related strongly to both the perpetration of and victimization by relational aggression these results suggest not only that individual beliefs and perceptions of the school environment are important in understanding perpetration and victimization of relational aggression but also that risk for involvement in relational aggression is distinct from that of physical aggression implications for school interventions are discussed as well as suggestions for future research
